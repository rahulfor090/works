<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Grief</bold> is a person's emotional response to loss.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Mourning</bold> is an outward expression of that grief, including cultural and religious customs surrounding the death. It is also the process of adapting to life after loss.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Bereavement</bold> is a period of grief and mourning after a loss.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Anticipatory grief</bold> is a response to an expected loss. It affects both the person diagnosed with a terminal illness as well as their families.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Disenfranchised grief</bold> as defined by Kenneth Doka (1989) is a “grief that persons experience when they incur a loss that is not or cannot be openly acknowledged, publicly mourned, or socially supported.” Physicians regularly encounter losses in the form of patient deaths. Grief in healthcare providers is unsanctioned and may play a role in physician burnout.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (broken heart syndrome)</bold> is a weakening of the left ventricle caused by severe emotional or physical stress such as loss of a loved one, sudden illness, a serious accident, or a natural disaster (e.g., earthquake). It almost exclusively occurs in women and resolves within a month.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Advance care planning</bold> making plans about the care you would want if you could no longer speak for yourself while you are healthy enough to consider options, make choices and discuss with your family; making a living will and naming a healthcare surrogate are part of advance care planning.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Advance directive</bold> is a document that describes the healthcare you would and would not want if you were seriously ill and unable to speak for yourself.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Anticipatory grief</bold> mourning the death of a loved one before that person has died, common when the patient is terminally ill.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Bereavement;</bold> grief following the death of a loved one.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Assisted death</bold> is also known as “physician-assisted suicide”, “physician-assisted dying” or “aid in dying” and is legal the US states of Oregon and Washington. It permits mentally competent, terminally-ill adult patients to request a prescription for life-ending medication from their physician.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Autonomy</bold> this is the exercise of self-determination and choice among alternatives, based on the individual's values and beliefs.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Continuum of care</bold> relates to a course of therapy during which a patient's needs for comfort care and symptom relief is managed comprehensively and seamlessly. Hospice provides a continuum of care to terminally-ill patients, and aid-in-dying is assumed as the option of last resort at the end of that continuum.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Coma:</bold> “A profound or deep state of unconsciousness. An individual in a state of coma is alive but unable to move or respond to his or her environment.” Coma can result from chronic illness or severe injury/trauma.<a name="page478"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">478</span></span></p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Comfort care</bold> medical specialty, also referred to as palliative care, is often associated with hospice; however, it can also be used independently and alongside curative treatments. Palliative care is available in every state, appropriate for anyone at any stage of life suffering with a debilitating illness–terminal or not–and focuses on pain management and providing comfort.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>DNR/DNI</bold> stands for do not resuscitate/do not intubate and is a specific physician order. Do not resuscitate means that in the event of cardiac arrest, no CPR or electric shock will be performed to re-start the heart.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Double effect</bold> is the doctrine established by St. Thomas Aquinas in the 13th century in which an action that has two effects. The doctrine is often used to describe the impact of administering high doses of morphine or terminal sedation—treatments intended to relieve suffering but that often hasten death.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Durable power of attorney</bold> is a document appointing a surrogate to make medical decisions in the event that an individual becomes unable to make those decisions on their own. It is also sometimes referred to as a “health care proxy.”</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Euthanasia</bold> is translated literally as “good death” and refers to the act of painlessly but deliberately causing the death of another who is suffering from an incurable, painful disease or condition.</p>
<p class="indent"><bold>Active euthanasia:</bold> This is generally understood as the deliberate action of a medical professional or layperson to hasten a patient's death.</p>
<p class="indent"><bold>Passive euthanasia:</bold> This is generally understood as a patient's death due to actions not taken by a medical professional or layperson—actions that would normally keep the patient alive.</p>
<p class="indent"><bold>Voluntary euthanasia:</bold> This occurs at the request of the person who dies.</p>
<p class="indent"><bold>Non-voluntary euthanasia:</bold> This refers to when a patient is unconscious or otherwise mentally unable to make a meaningful choice between living and dying, and a legal surrogate makes the decision on the patient's behalf.</p>
<p class="indent"><bold>Involuntary euthanasia:</bold> This occurs when a patient's death is hastened without the patient's consent. While generally viewed as murder, there are some instances in which the death may be viewed as a “mercy killing.”</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Futile measures;</bold> this generally refers to the medical care of patients in which care will have little or no effect on the patient's outcome or prognosis.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Guardian ad litem;</bold> a latin term for a court-appointed representative who makes decisions in a legal proceeding on behalf of a minor or an incompetent or otherwise impaired person.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Hospice</bold> is an organization or institution that provides comfort (aka Palliative) care for dying individuals when medical treatment is no longer expected to cure the disease or prolong life. Hospice sometimes also applies to an insurance benefit that pays the costs of comfort care usually at home for patients with a prognosis or life-expectancy of six months or less.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Intent</bold> is a concept used to draw a moral distinction between aid-in-dying and other acts/omissions that cause death—such as terminal sedation and withdrawing life-sustaining therapy. “Intent” assumes the ability to draw a clear distinction between knowledge of a certain outcome and an <span class="italic">intention</span> to produce that outcome.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Life-sustaining treatment</bold> is any treatment, the discontinuation of which would result in death. Such treatments include technological interventions like dialysis and ventilators. They also include such simpler treatments as feeding tubes and antibiotics.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Living will</bold> is a type of advance directive containing instructions about future medical treatment in the event the individual is unable to communicate specific wishes due to illness or injury. Each state has its own regulations concerning the use of living wills.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Palliative care</bold> medical specialty is often associated with hospice; however, it can also be used independently and alongside curative treatments. Palliative care is available in every state, appropriate for anyone at any stage of life suffering with a terminal illness and focuses on pain management and providing comfort.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Surrogate decision making</bold> is a procedure that allows a loved one to make medical-care decisions in accordance with a patient's known wishes. If the patient's wishes are not known, the decisions are generally said to be made in the patient's “best interests.”</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Terminal sedation:</bold> Generally practiced during the final days or hours of a dying patient's life, this coma-like state is medically induced through medication when symptoms such as pain, nausea, breathlessness or delirium cannot be controlled while the patient is conscious. Patients generally die after the sedation's secondary effects of dehydration or other intervening complications.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Withholding/withdrawing treatment</bold> refers to omitting or ending such life sustaining treatments as ventilators, feeding tubes, kidney dialysis or medication that would otherwise prolong the patient's life. This legal act may be upon the patient's request, as the result of an advance directive or based upon the medical determination of futility.</p></li>

</div><div class="section" id="ch11lev1sec2"><h1 class="title">INTRODUCTION</h1>
<p class="noindent">Life is a series of losses and gains. Everyone experiences losses at various points in the life continuum. Birth, loss and death are universal and individually unique events of the human experience. At any stage of one's life, there is the potential for loss, grief and death. The goals of nursing focuses on health maintenance and health restoration, with an emphasis on facilitating maximum potentials in wellness.<a name="page479"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">479</span></span> Birth and death are two aspects of life, which will happen to everyone. Dying and death are painful and personal experiences for those that are dying and their loved ones caring for them. Death affects each person involved in multiple ways, including physically, psychologically, emotionally, spiritually, and financially. Whether the death is sudden and unexpected, or ongoing and expected, there is information and help available to address the impact of dying and death.</p>
</div><div class="section" id="ch11lev1sec3"><h1 class="title">LOSS</h1>
<p class="noindent">A person experiences loss in the absence of an object, person's body part or function, or emotion that was formerly present. Loss is an inevitable part of life, and grief is a natural part of the healing process. The reasons for grief are many, such as the loss of a loved one, the loss of health, or the letting go of a long-held dream. Dealing with a significant loss can be one of the most difficult times in a person's life.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch11lev2sec1"><h2 class="title">Five Categories of Loss</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p class=""><bold>Loss of external object:</bold> It involves any possession that is worn-out, misplaced, stolen or ruined by disaster, e.g., jewellery, money, etc.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Loss of a known environment:</bold> It is a loss associated with separation from a known environment, includes familiar setting for a period or relocating permanently and transfers from place to place, hospitalization.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Loss of significant others:</bold> It includes loss of parents, spouses, children, siblings, teachers, friends, neighbors and colleagues. And also entertainment figures and well known persons like cine actors, athletes, cricketers, popular figures of a particular field.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Loss of an aspect of life:</bold> It includes loss of a body part, physiological function, or psychological function, e.g., loss of limb, eye, hair, teeth, breast, etc., loss of urinary or bowel control, loss of memory, humor of self-esteem, self-confidence, power, respect, love, self-concept, self-identity, job.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Loss of life:</bold> Each person responds differently to death. Some will welcome death as a relief; some will have fear of separations, abandonment, loneliness, or mutilation, etc.</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch11lev2sec2"><h2 class="title">Other Classifications of Loss</h2>
<p class="noindent"><bold>Actual loss:</bold> It is easily identified and can be recognized by others as well as person sustaining the loss, loss of a limb, of a spouse, of a object and of a job.</p>
<p class="noindent"><bold>Perceived loss:</bold> It is felt by the person but is intangible or less intangible to others. For example:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Makirational loss,</bold> i.e., loss resulting from normal life transitions (loss of youth, of financial independence).</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Situational loss,</bold> i.e., loss occurring suddenly in reference to a specific external event (sudden death of loved one).</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">Other example of actual or perceived loss are physical loss, and psychological loss, e.g., losing limb from accident, losing limb leads to loss of self-image.</p>

</div><div class="section" id="ch11lev1sec4"><h1 class="title">GRIEF</h1>
<p class="noindent">Grief is a normal response to any loss, grieving is the emotional reaction to loss. It occurs with loss caused by separation as well as with loss caused by death. Sometimes the terms, grief, mourning and bereavement are often used interchangeable. Grief is a subjective state of emotional, physical and social response to the loss of a valued entity. The loss may be real, in which case it can be substantiated by others (e.g., death of a loved one), or perceived by the individual alone, in which case it cannot be perceived or shared by others (e.g., loss of feeling of femininity following mastectomy).</p>
<div class="section" id="ch11lev2sec4"><h2 class="title">Definition</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Grief:</bold> It is a form of sorrow that follows the perception or anticipation, loss of one or more valued or significant objects. These responses often include helplessness, loneliness, hopelessness, sadness, guilt and anger <bold>(<a href="#ch11fig1" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 11.1</a>)</bold>.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Bereavement:</bold> It is the state of grieving during which a person goes through grief reaction. It is the state of thought, feeling, and activity that follows loss, or includes grief and mourning. It is the experience of having lost something or someone by death.</p></li>

</div><div class="section" id="ch11lev1sec5"><h1 class="title">TYPES OF GRIEF</h1>
<p class="noindent">There are several different types of grief reactions that people can have. Some of these are considered to be normal while others signify an alteration in coping with the loss.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch11lev2sec5"><h2 class="title">Normal or Uncomplicated Grief</h2>
<p class="noindent">This type of grief symbolizes the most desirable and universal reaction to loss and is considered to be normal Corless (2010). The individual will have physical, emotional, cognitive, and behavioral reactions following the loss and will eventually move toward adjusting to it. The period of time for this can vary from person to person and is dependent on the type of relationship, type of loss and individual factors related to the bereaved. The nurse should support the family to take the time that they need for this normal grief processes to happen.</p>

<div class="section" id="ch11lev2sec6"><h2 class="title">Anticipatory Grief</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Anticipatory grief is grief that occurs before the loss of a loved one. Sometimes anticipatory grief starts at the time of a terminal diagnosis and can proceed until the person dies.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Both patients and family members can feel anticipatory loss. For the patient, they can anticipate the loss of independence, function or comfort.</p></li>
<li><p class="">This can cause a lot of pain and anxiety if not given the proper support. For the family, they often start grieving for the loss of their loved one before they die.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Perhaps it is because they bear witness to the pain or suffering they see their loved one go through or maybe they are also envisioning their own life without their loved one in it.</p></li>
<li><p class="">They start to think about all the things that they still wanted to share with their loved one, who will likely not live long enough to do. This type of grief has been shown to help cushion a person's bereavement reaction.</p></li>

</div>
<div class="section" id="ch11lev2sec7"><h2 class="title">Complicated Grief</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Complicated grief may require professional assistance depending on its severity.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Individuals could be at risk for complicated grief if they experience losses that are sudden or traumatic or resulting from suicide/homicide.</p></li>
<li><p class="">If the person has already had recent losses or previous losses from which they did not resolve their grief, it can contribute to developing complicated grief reaction with the new loss.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Lack of a support network or concurrent stressors such as ailing health or relationships, also can contribute to this type of grief.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch11lev2sec8"><h2 class="title">Disenfranchised Grief</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">This type of grief is defined as grief that has not been validated or recognized.</p></li>
<li><p class="">This type of grief often develops in individuals who have lost loved ones to stigmatized illnesses, such as AIDS, or through socially unacceptable ways, such as abortion.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The loss of a previously severed relationship, such as with divorce, can also contribute to this type of grief because the individual may not be able to mourn as openly for that loved one due to the circumstances surrounding their relationship.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch11lev2sec9"><h2 class="title">Unresolved Grief</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">In this type of grief, the bereaved has failed to move through the stages of grief and accomplish the work needed to come to terms with the loss.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Many factors can contribute to the manifestation of this type of grieving and can include—lack of formal closure (loved one's body never found or laid to rest), multiple or concurrent losses, or social isolation.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div><div class="section" id="ch11lev1sec6"><h1 class="title">MANIFESTATIONS OF GRIEF</h1>
<p class="noindent">Grief is a normal part of coping with a loss, but for some people, it can be far more serious. In some situations, normal grief can lead to a grief disorder, which can require professional help to overcome <bold>(<a href="#ch11fig2" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 11.2</a> and <a href="#ch11tbl1" class="ulink-inter">Table 11.1</a>)</bold>.<a name="page481"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">481</span></span></p>

<div class="section" id="ch11lev2sec10"><h2 class="title">Feelings</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Sadness</bold> is a common feeling experienced after the loss of a loved one. This is often demonstrated by crying, a gesture that evokes a sympathetic and protective reaction from others. Not allowing sadness to be experienced with or without tears has the potential to lead to complicated grief.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Numbness or shock</bold> is often experienced immediately after a loss. This serves as a defense to block pain and to protect the bereaved from being overwhelmed. It allows opportunity to be gradually introduced to the reality of the loss.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Anger</bold> is frequently associated with loss. It is not uncommon for the anger experienced to be directed at either the deceased of the bereaved, the bereaved themselves – or both. Worden (2005) suggests that anger comes from a sense of frustration due to an inability to prevent the death and as a regressive experience that occurs after losing someone close. Anger experienced by the bereaved needs to be appropriately identified in order to bring it to a healthy conclusion.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Guilt</bold> is also common in the process of grief. The bereaved might feel guilty about being alive while the loved one is dead. Guilt is often manifested over something that occurred during the time of death that the bereaved individual feels they could have prevented somehow.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Anxiety</bold> is a common feeling associated with loss and it comes primarily from; a fear that they will not be able to take care of themselves and a heightened sense of personal death awareness. The anxiety experienced may vary from mild anxiety to more extreme panic attacks. In this sense, being confronted with the reality of death can be a little frightening. Other feelings associated with grief include loneliness, fatigue, helplessness, yearning and emancipation.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Cognitions:</bold> The most common cognitive response to death is a preoccupation with the deceased, which occurs as a form of obsessional thinking. Some preoccupation may be in the form of intrusive thoughts that may be related to guilt or other unresolved issues. This commonly occurs in the early stages of grief and disappears after a short while.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">Prolonged experience of these thoughts may trigger depression. Hallucination (visual and auditory) of the deceased loved one is also a frequent experience of the bereaved. Other cognitive responses may include confusion, disbelief, and passive suicidal thoughts. <bold><a href="#ch11fig3" class="ulink-inter">Figure 11.3</a></bold> shows problems associated with loss and grief.</p>

<p class="noindent"><bold>Behaviors:</bold> There are a number of behaviors associated with a normal grief reaction too. These are often experienced immediately after a loss and correct themselves over time. Disturbances in sleep and eating patterns are very common during times of grief. Absent mindedness and social withdrawal are also common behaviors that are evident in the grieving process. Behaviors such as dreams of the deceased and avoiding reminders of the deceased are also reported in the early stages.</p>

<p class="noindent">Kubler-Ross (1969) having done extensive research with terminally ill patients identified five stages of feelings and behavior that individuals experience in response to a real, perceived or anticipated loss <bold>(<a href="#ch11fig4" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 11.4</a>)</bold>:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Stage I: Denial:</bold> This is a stage of shock and disbelief. The response may be one of “No, it cannot be true!” Denial is a protective mechanism that allows the individual to cope within an immediate timeframe while organizing more effective defense strategies.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Stage II: Anger</bold><span class="italic">:</span> “Why me?” and “It is not fair!” are comments often expressed during the anger stage. Anger may be directed at self or displaced on loved ones, caregivers, and even God. There may be a preoccupation with an idealized image of the lost entity.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Stage III: Bargaining:</bold> “If God will help me through this, I promise I will go to church every Sunday and volunteer my time to help others”. During this stage, which is generally not visible or evident to others, a bargain is made with God in an attempt to reverse or postpone the loss.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Stage IV: Depression:</bold> During this stage the full impact of the loss is experienced. This is a time of quiet desperation and disengagement from all associations with the lost entity.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Stage V: Acceptance:</bold> The final stage brings a feeling of peace regarding the loss that has occurred. Focus is on the reality of the loss and its meaning for the individuals affected by it.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">All individuals do not experience each of these stages in response to a loss, nor do they necessarily experience them in this order. Some individuals grieving behavior may fluctuate, and even overlap between stages <bold>(<a href="#ch11tbl2" class="ulink-inter">Table 11.2</a>)</bold>.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch11lev2sec12"><h2 class="title">Grief Process (Reactions to Grief and Death)</h2>
<p class="noindent">Grief is the emotional pain caused by a loss. Reactions to both grief and dying are similar. The stages of these reactions overlap and vary among individuals. Engel (1954) proposed that grieving process has six phases as given below:<a name="page483"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">483</span></span></p>

</div><div class="section" id="ch11lev1sec8"><h1 class="title">GRIEF PROCESS</h1>
<p class="noindent">Every step of the process is natural and healthy. It is only when a person gets stuck in one step for a long period of time that the grieving can become unhealthy, destructive and even dangerous. Going through the grieving process is not the same for everyone, but everyone does have a common goal; acceptance of the loss and to keep moving forward. This process is different for every person but can be understood in four or more stages, depending upon the theory that is being used.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Shock and denial:</bold> Shock is the initial reaction to loss. Shock is the person's emotional protection from being too suddenly overwhelmed by the loss. The person may not yet be willing or able to believe what their mind knows to be true. This stage normally lasts two or three months.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Intense concern:</bold> Intense concern often manifests by being unable to think of anything else. Even during daily tasks, thoughts of the loss keep coming to mind. Conversations with one at this stage always turn to the loss as well. This period may last from six months to a year.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Despair and depression:</bold> Despair and depression is a long period of grief, the most painful and protracted stage for the griever (during which the person gradually comes to terms with the reality of the loss). The process typically involves a wide range of feelings, thoughts, and behaviors. Many behaviors may be irrational. Depression can include feelings of anger, guilt, sadness and anxiety.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Recovery:</bold> The goal of grieving is not the elimination of all the pain or the memories of the loss. In this stage, one shows a new interest in daily activities and begins to function normally day to day. The goal is to reorganize one's life, so the loss is an important part of life rather than its center.</p></li>
</ul>
</div><div class="section" id="ch11lev1sec9"><h1 class="title">THEORIES OF GRIEF AND LOSS</h1>
<p class="noindent">Grief models can help people to work through the grieving process, reassured that what they are going through is ‘normal.’ The following grief theories are among the best-known models exploring how people grieve and learn to heal, living with loss <bold>(<a href="#ch11tbl3" class="ulink-inter">Table 11.3</a> and <a href="#ch11fig5" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 11.5</a>)</bold>.<a name="page484"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">484</span></span></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>The five stages of grief:</bold> The five stages of grief is one of the best-known grief theories. Psychiatrist Dr Elisabeth Kubler-Ross identified denial anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance as the key ‘stages’ our minds go through after someone dies. Some people have said that the five stages of her grieving process are too orderly to reflect just how messy grief can be. Dr Kubler-Ross later said that her theory was never intended as a linear journey, but a series of points we may often revisit, as we adjust to life without someone we loved.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Tonkin's model of grief:</bold> Dr Lois Tonkin's model of grief is based on the principle that grief is a wound we gradually heal around. Growing around our grief means that the loss of someone will always be a part of us, but that this void and sadness will eventually not dominate our capacity to truly live.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>The four tasks of grieving:</bold> Dr J William Worden's four tasks of grieving, offers four things we can strive to do, in order to live with the loss of someone: Accept the reality of what's happened, process the pain, adjust to a life without someone's physical presence and create a new connection with them, in our memory.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>The six Rs of mourning:</bold> The six Rs of mourning is clinical psychologist Dr Therese Rando's theory about how actively grieving is in itself, a healing act.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">The six tasks she identifies aim to work through four grief phases: recognizing the reality of a death, reacting to the separation, ‘re-experiencing’ good and bad memories, letting go of how things were and accommodating memories of someone, in your changed world.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>The dual process model:</bold> Clinical psychologists Professor Margaret Stroebe and Dr Henk Schut's dual process model of grief, works around to ways of journeying through bereavement. It allocates time to think about how much you miss your loved one and time also to take on practical activities that can give you respite, for short a while, from your pain. The idea is to go back and forth, or ‘oscillate’ between these stages, as you work to accommodate someone's physical absence from your life.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>The reconstruction of meaning:</bold> This grief theory, the reconstruction meaning explores how to adjust to the alien place you find yourself in, when someone dies. Bereavement can turn your world upside down, making it difficult to find meaning in it. Perhaps your own sense of identity has changed and your sense of ‘place.’ This grief model can help you in ‘meaning-making’, through assimilating (adjusting to a loss) and accommodating.</p></li>

</div><div class="section" id="ch11lev1sec10"><h1 class="title">KUBLER-ROSS: 5 STAGES OF DYING</h1>
<p class="noindent">The stages of mourning and grief are universal and are experienced by people from all walks of life. Mourning occurs in response to an individual's own terminal illness, the loss of a close relationship, or to the death of a valued being, human or animal. There are five stages of normal grief that were first proposed by Elisabeth Kübler-Ross in her book (1969).</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p class=""><bold>Denial and isolation:</bold> The first reaction to learning of terminal illness or death of a cherished loved one is to deny the reality of the situation.<a name="page485"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">485</span></span> It is a normal reaction to rationalize overwhelming emotions. It is a defense mechanism that buffers the immediate shock. We block out the words and hide from the facts. This is a temporary response that carries us through the first wave of pain.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Anger:</bold> As the masking effects of denial and isolation begin to wear, reality and its pain re-emerge. We are not ready. The intense emotion is deflected from our vulnerable core, redirected and expressed instead as anger. The anger may be aimed at inanimate objects, complete strangers, friends or family. Anger may be directed at our dying or deceased loved one. Rationally, we know the person is not to be blamed. Emotionally, however, we may resent the person for causing us pain or for leaving us. We feel guilty for being angry, and this makes us angrier.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Bargaining:</bold> The normal reaction to feelings of helplessness and vulnerability is often a need to regain control—</p>
<p class="">If only we had sought medical attention sooner…</p>
<p class="">If only we got a second opinion from another doctor…</p>
<p class="">If only we had tried to be a better person toward them…</p>
<p class="indent">Secretly, we may make a deal with God or our higher power in an attempt to postpone the inevitable. This is a weaker line of defense to protect us from the painful reality.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Depression:</bold> Two types of depression are associated with mourning. The first one is a reaction to practical implications relating to the loss. Sadness and regret predominate this type of depression. We worry about the costs and burial. We worry that, in our grief, we have spent less time with others that depend on us. This phase may be eased by simple clarification and reassurance. We may need a bit of helpful cooperation and a few kind words. The second type of depression is more subtle and, in a sense, perhaps more private. It is our quiet preparation to separate and to bid our loved one farewell. Sometimes all we really need is a hug.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Acceptance:</bold> Reaching this stage of mourning is a gift not afforded to everyone. Death may be sudden and unexpected or we may never see beyond our anger or denial. It is not necessarily a mark of bravery to resist the inevitable and to deny ourselves the opportunity to make our peace. This phase is marked by withdrawal and calm. This is not a period of happiness and must be distinguished from depression.</p></li>
</ol>
</div><div class="section" id="ch11lev1sec11"><h1 class="title">SIX ‘R’S OF MOURNING</h1>
<p class="noindent">Rando divides mourning into six separate tasks to be completed and groups those tasks into three stages. The three stages are avoidance, confrontation and accommodation. Rando uses it to be the active process of dealing with that grief. Bear this in mind as you read about the six ‘R's.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch11lev2sec14"><h2 class="title">Phase 1: Avoidance</h2>
<p class="noindent">The avoidance phase is when you may be unable or unwilling to fully understand what has happened. Though you might understand the fact that your loved one has died, a part of you can still not accept this as reality. The avoidance phase has one task.</p>
<p class="noindent"><bold>Recognize the loss:</bold> According to Rando, fully recognizing the loss means understanding what happened and really accepting it, knowing in your heart, that your loved one has gone.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch11lev2sec15"><h2 class="title">Phase 2: Confrontation</h2>
<p class="noindent">The confrontation phrase involves dealing with your grief and finding ways to process what you are experiencing. There are three tasks in this phase:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p class=""><bold>React to the separation:</bold> This means understanding and embracing all the complex, powerful emotions you are feeling. It also means acknowledging something known as ‘secondary losses’. For example, the death of a spouse may also mean the loss of financial security, the loss of your idea of the future, the loss of romantic intimacy. These are all secondary losses for which you may also be grieving.</p>

<li><p class=""><bold>Recollect and re-experience:</bold> Recollecting means remembering your time with your loved one, through the good and bad. These memories will become an important way of maintaining a relationship with your loved one, as they will continue being an important influence in your life.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Relinquish old attachments:</bold> This may sounds harsh at first, but ‘relinquishing old attachments’ does not necessarily mean moving on or forgetting your loved one. It's a long and very gradual process where you slowly begin to process the impact of your loved one's absence.</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch11lev2sec16"><h2 class="title">Phase 3: Accommodation</h2>
<p class="noindent">The accommodation phase is all about finding meaning in life again. This doesn't mean you won't still have feelings of sadness or longing, but you will be able to have moments of happiness again. There are two tasks in this phase:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p class=""><bold>Readjust</bold> to the new world without forgetting the old world. Readjusting can mean becoming more comfortable with new roles and responsibilities, but also accepting who you are now and how the death of your loved one may have changed you.<a name="page486"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">486</span></span></p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Reinvest emotional energy:</bold> This is another way of describing the act of enjoying life again, finding new friends or projects, and rediscovering a sense of purpose. This should not be interpreted as ‘replacing’ your loved one, as Rando very much emphasises the continuation of your love for them.</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
</div><div class="section" id="ch11lev1sec12"><h1 class="title">FACTORS INFLUENCING LOSS AND GRIEF RESPONSES</h1>
<p class="noindent">In each situation in which an individual (or group) experiences a death, funeral, or loss, the responses may differ greatly from previous responses to similar losses. No two losses are the same. No two relationships are the same. No two points in time are the same. Many factors vary, and so our grief responses vary also.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Current health situation</p></li>
<li><p class="">Relationship with person who has died/thing which has been lost</p></li>
<li><p class="">Age of person grieving</p></li>
<li><p class="">Previous experience of grief</p></li>
<li><p class="">Cultural background</p></li>
<li><p class="">Belief system</p></li>
<li><p class="">Financial situation</p></li>
<li><p class="">Knowledge around cause of loss/death</p></li>
<li><p class="">Personality</p></li>
<li><p class="">Concurrent losses/changes occurring</p></li>
<li><p class="">Support systems—family/friends/community</p></li>
<li><p class="">Cause of death (i.e., expected or not expected)</p></li>
<li><p class="">Expectation of death</p></li>
<li><p class="">Recognition of loss by others (i.e., disenfranchised grief)</p></li>
<li><p class="">Social ‘acceptability’ of cause of death</p></li>
<li><p class="">Social ‘acceptability’ of relationship of bereaved to deceased</p></li>
<li><p class="">Ability to communicate feelings</p></li>
<li><p class="">Language levels</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">There are many other factors also. It can assist us, when supporting others, to recognize the cumulative effect of changes and transitions in a person's life journey. A major loss rarely occurs in isolation, and to be capable of assessing the overall impact of grief on an individual is one of the first steps to appropriate support.</p>
</div><div class="section" id="ch11lev1sec13"><h1 class="title">GRIEF, BEREAVEMENT AND MOURNING</h1>
<p class="noindent">Grief and bereavement are universal experiences that people go through when they are dealing with a loss in their lives. In end-of-life care, nurses must understand the fundamentals about grief, loss, and bereavement on the part of patients and families, and also within themselves. Individuals each express and cope with losses differently and a nurse should expect to see that when working with patients and families at the end of life.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Bereavement includes grief and mourning and has been considered to be the “time period in which the survivor adjusts to their life without their loved one”.</p></li>
<li><p class="">This period can include the time right after the loss or death occurs, during the funeral proceedings, and during the grieving process afterward.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Different individuals respond to this period in various ways. A person's age, physical and emotional health, culture, and previous experience with loss can all affect the way that they grieve during this period of time.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Bereavement differs from grief in that it includes the period of time from the beginning of the loss until acceptance has been reached.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Mourning takes place during this time and can differ based on personal and cultural factors.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent"><bold>The role of the Nurse includes three things:</bold></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p class="">The nurse must facilitate the grieving process by assessing the grief;</p></li>
<li><p class="">The nurse must assist the patient with issues and concerns related to the grief; and</p></li>
<li><p class="">The nurse must support the survivors. The purpose of this chapter is to identify the main components related to grief, bereavement and mourning in the context of end-of-life care, to describe the various types of grief, and to explore the support needed to help individuals cope and live with the loss.</p></li>
</ol>
<div class="section" id="ch11lev2sec17"><h2 class="title">Support for the Bereaved</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Both informal and formal support can be utilized to help bereaved individuals cope with the loss of their loved one.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The kind of support a person requires will differ and it is important for the nurse to conduct a thorough grief assessment.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Grief should be assessed frequently in the bereavement period in order for the nurse to be able to develop an effective plan to assist the bereaved in coping with their loss.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Bereavement follow-up with families is part of most hospice programs and can include formal activities and events to promote closure and acceptance.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Many hospices have nondenominational memorial services to honor those patients who have been lost.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Family members and staff are invited to participate, and these can be effective at helping both parties find closure. Other formal types of support can include support groups.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Most organizations and/or healthcare systems have various support groups for individuals, some of which are specific to a particular type of illness (i.e., cancer).</p></li>
<li><p class="">Individual or group counseling or psychotherapy are other methods that can assist the bereaved in coping with their loss.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Nurses are in the ideal position to assist patients with identifying and expressing their feelings related to the loss.</p></li>
<li><p class="">One of the biggest facilitators of this process which nurses can engage in is active listening. By actively listening to the bereaved, it helps them express their feelings and feel as though they are being heard.<a name="page487"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">487</span></span></p></li>
<li><p class="">Developing a strong nurse-patient-family relationship in the beginning of the health care encounter can help with the support needed during the bereavement period.</p></li>

<li><p class="">Grant time for the grieving process.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Identify expected grieving behaviors, such as crying, somatic symptoms, and anxiety.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Use therapeutic communication. Name the emotion the client is feeling. For example, say, “You sound as though you are angry. Anger is a normal feeling for someone who has lost a loved one. Tell me about how you are feeling.”</p></li>
<li><p class="">Avoid communication that inhibits the open expression of feelings, such as offering false reassurance, giving advice, changing the subject, and taking the focus away from the grieving individual.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Assist the grieving individual to accept the reality of the loss.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Support efforts to “move on” in the face of the loss.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Encourage the building of new relationships.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Provide continuing support; encourage the support of family and friends.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Assess for signs of ineffective coping, such as refusing to leave the home months after the client's spouse has died.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Share information about mourning and grieving with the client, who may not realize that her feelings, such as anger toward the deceased, are expected.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Encourage attendance at bereavement or grief support groups. Provide information about available community resources.</p></li>

<p class="noindent">Grief counseling is a form of psychotherapy that aims to help people cope with the physical, emotional, social, spiritual, and cognitive responses to loss. These experiences are commonly thought to be brought on by a loved person's death, but may more broadly be understood as shaped by any significant life-altering loss (e.g., divorce, home foreclosure, or job loss).</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Grief counseling becomes necessary when a person is so disabled by their grief; and, so overwhelmed by their loss that their normal coping processes are disabled or shut down.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Grief counseling facilitates expression of emotion and thought about the loss, including their feeling sad, anxious, angry, lonely, guilty, relieved, isolated, confused, or numb.</p></li>
<li><p class="">It includes thinking creatively about the challenges that follow loss and coping with concurrent changes in their lives.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Often people feel disorganized, tired, have trouble concentrating, sleep poorly and have vivid dreams, and they may experience the change in appetite.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Grief counseling facilitates the process of resolution in the natural reactions to loss. It is appropriate for reaction to losses that have overwhelmed a person's coping ability.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Grief counseling may be called upon when a person suffers anticipatory grief, for example, an intrusive and frequent worry about a loved one whose death is neither imminent nor likely.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Anticipatory mourning also occurs when a loved one has a terminal illness. This can handicap that person's ability to stay present whilst simultaneously holding onto, letting go of, and drawing closer to the dying relative.</p></li>

<li><p class=""><bold>Adapting:</bold> Bringing order back into daily life while you continue to grieve: take care of basic needs (personal grooming, shopping, cooking, cleaning, paying bills), learn to live without the loved one, accept help, focus on helping children cope, connect with other grieving families for mutual support, take control of grieving so that grief does not control you, slowly accept the new reality.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Equilibrium:</bold> Attaining stability and routines: reestablish a life that works alright, enjoy pleasant activities with family members and good times with friends, do productive work, choose a positive new direction in life while honoring the past, learn how to handle people who ask questions about what you’ve been through.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Transformation:</bold> Rethinking your purpose in life and the basis for your identity; looking for meaning in tragic, senseless loss; allowing yourself to have both painful and positive feelings about your loss and become able to choose which feelings you focus on; allowing yourself to discover that your struggle has led you to develop a stronger, better version of yourself than you expected could exist; learning how to talk with others about your heroic healing journey without exposing them to your pain; becoming supportive of others trying to deal with their losses.</p></li>

</div><div class="section" id="ch11lev1sec15"><h1 class="title">CARE OF DYING</h1>
<p class="noindent">Care of the dying patient generally refers to care in the last days or hours of life. The goals of care during the last hours and days of life are to ensure comfort and dignity. Good palliative care does not hasten death. In humanitarian settings, where healthcare providers may not have expertise in palliative care, identifying when patients are at this stage of life can be challenging. In addition, during this time, physical symptoms can be difficult to control; the best way to ensure they are well managed is to anticipate the symptoms and develop a management plan.<a name="page488"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">488</span></span></p>

<p class="noindent">Cassen (1991) suggests seven essential features in the management of the dying patient:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p class=""><bold>Concern:</bold> Empathy, compassion, and involvement are essential.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Competence:</bold> Skill and knowledge can be as reassuring as warmth and concern.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Communication:</bold> Allow patients to speak their minds and get to know them.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Children:</bold> If children want to visit the dying, it is generally advisable; they bring consolation to dying patients.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Cohesion:</bold> Family cohesion reassures both the patient and family.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Cheerfulness:</bold> A gentle, appropriate sense of humor can be palliative; a somber or anxious demeanor should be avoided.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Consistency:</bold> Continuing, persistent attention is highly valued by patients who often fear that they are a burden and will be abandoned; consistent physician involvement mitigates these fears.</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
</div><div class="section" id="ch11lev1sec16"><h1 class="title">DEATH</h1>
<p class="noindent">Death is present when an individual has sustained either irreversible cessation of circulatory and respiratory functions or irreversible cessation of all functions of the entire brain, including the brainstem. The supportive nursing care during death is as follows: To give compassionate nursing care and support to the family and patient during the grieving and dying process, the nurse should consider the five aspects of human functioning. By using the nursing process, the nurse does an assessment of each aspect; physical, emotional, intellectual, sociocultural, and spiritual to fully understand and adequately provide interventions in these areas.<a name="page490"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">490</span></span></p>
<div class="section" id="ch11lev2sec29"><h2 class="title">Five Aspects of Human Functioning</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p class=""><bold>Physical:</bold> While interviewing and observing the patient, the nurse should assess such, areas as sleeping patterns, body image, activities of daily livings (ADLs), mobility, general health, medications and pain. The nurse also should address the basic needs of nutrition, elimination oxygenation, activity, rest, sleep and safety.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Emotional:</bold> Preparing for one's death is a personal endeavor filled with anxiety and fear. Assessing the patient and family's anxiety level, guilt, anger, level of acceptance and identification is important. Major fears of the dying patient include fears of abandonment, loss of control, pain and discomfort and the fear of the unknown. The nurses can intervene appropriately when they are able to accept the patient's family's individual feelings, offer encouragement and support, and give the patient's “permission to die”.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Intellectual:</bold> Intellectual assessment includes an evaluation of the patient and family's educational level, their knowledge and abilities, and expectations they have in regard to how and when death will occur. Some aspects of the intellectual dimension can be altered during the dying process because of physiological changes, medications the patient's emotional state, or the disease process. Being alert, to these changes will avert problems if the patient's memory or sensations are decreased.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Social:</bold> Assessing the patient and family's support systems is valuable. Ascertaining if family members desire to assist in the patient's daily care will not only lessen the family's sense of loss of control but also will clarify what tasks the family will do and what will be done by nursing staff.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Spiritual:</bold> The nurse assesses the spiritual dimension by gaining insight into the patient's philosophy of life, his religious resources, and how the rituals of his faith group have significance in dealing with his death. Interventions in this area can come from clergy, friends, family, healthcare providers, and significant others. Supporting the patient and family belief system and values is important.</p></li>

<p class="noindent">Family members or close friends may choose to be involved in washing and dressing the body after death has occurred. Caring for a body is not easy and can stir up strong emotions. Washing the person's body after death is much like giving the person a bath during his or her illness.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Wash the person's face,</bold> gently closing the eyes before beginning, using the soft pad of your fingertip. If you close them and hold them closed for a few minutes following death, they may stay closed on their own. If they do not, close again and place a soft smooth cloth over them. Then place a small soft weight to keep the eyes in position. To make a weight, fill a small plastic bag with dry uncooked rice, lentils, small beans or seeds.</p>
<p class="indent">After you have washed the face, close the mouth before the body starts to stiffen. If the mouth will not stay shut, place a rolled-up towel or washcloth under the chin. If this does not provide enough support to keep the mouth closed, use a light-weight, smooth fabric scarf. Place the middle of the scarf at the top of the head, wrapping each end around the side of the face, under the chin and up to the top of the head where it can be gently tied. These supports will become unnecessary in a few hours and can be removed.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Wash the hair</bold> unless it has been washed recently. For a man, you might shave his face if that would be his normal practice.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Clean the teeth and mouth.</bold> Do not remove dentures because you may have difficulty replacing them as the body stiffens.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Clean the body using a facecloth with water and a small amount of soap.</bold> Begin with the arms and legs and then move to the front and back of the trunk. You may need someone to help you roll the person to each side to wash the back. If you wish, you can add fragrant oil or flower petals to your rinse water. Dry the part of the body you are working on before moving to another. Some families or cultures may also choose to apply a special lotion, oil or fragrance to the person's skin.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Dress or cover the body according to personal wishes or cultural practices</bold>. A shirt or a dress can be cut up the middle of the back from the bottom to just below but not through the neckline or collar. Place the arms into the sleeves first and then slipping the neck opening over the head, tucking the sides under the body on each side.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Position the arms alongside his or her body and be sure the legs are straight</bold>. If the person is in a hospital bed with the head raised, lower the head of the bed to the flat position.</p></li>

It is an ancient ritual providing an opportunity for people to offer a final mark of respect to the deceased person.

<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Do-not-resuscitate order (DNR):</bold> Sudden death from cardiac arrest requires CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation) by competent persons.<a name="page493"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">493</span></span> This is the life-saving measures according to the agency policy unless the primary physician has written a “do not resuscitate order” in the client's medical record. Health care agencies are required to have policies for a DNR decision. The principles of informed consent respected by Physician who writes a DNR order. When the client is either comatose or near death there should be knowledge by the physician and the client's family about the actions to prolong the client's life.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Wills of the patient:</bold> Various countries have laws regarding the legal requirements for written and oral wills. Nurses are usually required to notify the physician and nurse supervisor before acting as a witness and signing a will. Nurses should refrain from assisting the client with the wording of the will at this should be done with legal advice from an advocate.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Pronouncement of death:</bold> The government has formed laws to protect the public when dealing with issues of death. The various definitions of death are as follows: The absence of awareness of external stimuli, lack of movement or spontaneous breathing, absent reflexes, a flat brain wave or EEG and definition of brain death which requires irreversible cessation of all functioning of the brain. It is usually within the scope of practice of medicine to pronounce a client dead.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Care of deceased:</bold> When a client dies, the nurse is responsible to treat the deceased with respect and dignity. The nurse should prepare the body for removal to the mortuary according to the agency polices, the nurse is responsible for properly identifying the body could result in severe distress for the family as well as legal ramifications for both hospital and the nurse.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Autopsy:</bold> An autopsy is performed to determine the cause of death. In case of suspicious death or the presence of communicable disease. The cause of death also has to do with payment from insurance policies and the workers compensation. It requires consent in writing and nurse is responsible for ensuring that all documentation is in place before releasing a body for autopsy.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Organ donation:</bold> The donation of organs for transplantation is a matter that requires compassion and sensitivity from the caregivers. It is important that family of the deceased know the importance of and process for organ donation. In some countries, any person of age 18 or older may become an organ donor by written consent. In the absence of proper documentation, a family member or legal guardian may authorize donation of the organs. It requires the collaborative efforts of the nurse with physician. Social workers and clergy (priest) to ensure timely removal of the organs.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Euthanasia:</bold> It is merci-killing. This means easy or painless death. This word was derived from Greek word meaning “Good death.”</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="italic"><bold>Two types:</bold></span></p>
<p class=""><ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Active euthanasia:</span> It is to take delibrate action to end the patient's life. A physician who administers a lethal dose commits active euthanasia.</p></li>

<li><p class=""><bold>Advanced directives:</bold> The concept has to develop as a mechanism for dealing with some of the decisions that arise when caring for terminally ill.

<li><p class=""><bold>Uses of advance directives:</bold>
<ul style="list-style-type: square">
<li><p class="">An advance directive tells the health care team what kind of care the patient would like to have if he is unable to make medical decisions (e.g., if in coma)</p></li>

<ul style="list-style-type: square">
<li><p class="">Organ transplantation is truly one of the miracles of modern medicine, saving the lives of many patients and improving the quality of life for many more.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Given the ever-increasing gap between the number of organs needed and the supply, nurses have an ethical obligation to help ensure that the desires of people who want to donate organs are respected.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Nurses have to ensure that the consent process is informed and voluntary.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Information to the patient should consist of a balanced discussion of the available options and counseling to help patients or their families reach the choice that is best for them, including the provision of information about the urgent need for organs and the consolation that many families derive from knowing that their loved one was able to help others.</p></li></ul></p></li>

<li><p class="">Advance directives are integrated into the client's plan of care by nurses and other healthcare professionals.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Any and all information about advance directives is also documented and communicated with other members of the healthcare team so that all of these client's choices are upheld in all aspects of care and all clients should be encouraged to initiate advance directives whenever they have failed to generate these important documents in the past.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The ultimate purpose of advance directives is to guide professional decision making and direct the client's care and treatments at the end of life.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Advance directives also provide the legal basis for all clients to accept or reject care as they wish because they have the innate right to autonomous decision making without coercion and self-determination even when they are no longer competent to do so.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Nurses must review and verify the patient's advance directive status with their first patient contact because an emergency life-threatening situation like a cardiac or respiratory arrest can occur at any time with little or no time to review these documents at that time.</p></li>

<div class="section" id="ch11lev2sec41"><h2 class="title">Living Will</h2>
<p class="noindent">A living will is a written document that declares what life-sustaining medical interventions a person wants if she becomes terminally ill with little or no hope of recovery and is unable to communicate her wishes. It was created in response to the increasing ability of medical technology to prolong dying, frequently in a painful and undignified way. Often at the time life supports are needed patients are unable to communicate their wishes. A patient's autonomy and right to privacy may be violated in such circumstances when it is medical personnel or others, and not the patient, who make crucial decisions regarding life supports.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">A living will is a limited document that expresses a person's preferences for future medical care.</p></li>
<li><p class="">It is called a “living” will because it is in effect while the person is still alive. In many states, the document is more formally called a medical directive to doctors or a declaration.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The focus of a living will is usually end-of-life care, but it can include instructions about any aspect of care or treatment.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Living wills become effective only when the person has lost capacity to make health care decisions and the person has a particular condition defined by state law—usually a terminal condition or permanent unconsciousness.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Some states recognize additional conditions such as an end-stage condition (for example, advanced Alzheimer disease) or any condition specified in the living will.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Many people believe that death is preferable to being perpetually dependent on medical equipment or having no hope of returning to a certain quality of life.<a name="page495"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">495</span></span></p></li>
<li><p class="">Others feel just as strongly that extreme heroic measures and technology should be used to extend life as long as possible, regardless of the degree of medical intervention required or the quality of life that results.</p></li>
<li><p class="">A living will allows a person to express either of these preferences (or any intermediate measure that the person finds acceptable).</p></li>
<li><p class="">Including information in a living will about core values relating to end-of-life care, personal priorities, and goals of care can be just as helpful, if not more so, than specific treatment wishes, because most specific treatment decisions are unforeseeable.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch11lev2sec42"><h2 class="title">DNR</h2>
<p class="noindent">A do-not-resuscitate order, or DNR order, is a medical order written by a doctor. It instructs health care providers not to do cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) if a patient's breathing stops or if the patient's heart stops beating.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">A do-not-resuscitate (DNR) order can also be part of an advance directive. Hospital staff tries to help any patient whose heart has stopped or who has stopped breathing.</p></li>
<li><p class="">They do this with cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). A DNR is a request not to have CPR if the heart stops or if you stop breathing. You can use an advance directive form or tell your doctor that you don't want to be resuscitated.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The doctor will put the DNR order in your medical chart. Doctors and hospitals in all states accept DNR orders. They do not have to be part of a living will or other advance directive.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">Other possible end-of-life issues that may be covered in an advance directive include:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Ventilation:</bold> If, and for how long, you want a machine to take over your breathing.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Tube feeding:</bold> If, and for how long, you want to be fed through a tube in your stomach or through an IV.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Palliative care (comfort care):</bold> Keeps you comfortable and manages pain. This could include receiving pain medicine or dying at home.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Organ donation:</bold> Specifying if you want to donate your organs, tissues, or body for other patients or for research.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch11lev2sec43"><h2 class="title">Euthanasia</h2>
<p class="noindent">Euthanasia is the practice of ending the life of a patient to limit the patient's suffering. The patient in question would typically be terminally ill or experiencing great pain and suffering. The word “euthanasia” itself comes from the Greek words “eu” (good) and “thanatos” (death). The idea is that instead of condemning someone to a slow, painful, or undignified death, euthanasia would allow the patient to experience a relatively “good death.”</p>
<p class="indent">Euthanasia being intensely debated for more two decades globally was a sensitive topic related to one's own choice and death. It is a highly complicated issue involving implications in different aspects, such as medical, moral, ethical, social and so on. The report reviewed voluntary active euthanasia which refers to an intentional action administered by physicians through injecting lethal drugs to end a life, to relieve the unbearable suffering of the patient. Other classifications of euthanasia were also introduced.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch11lev3sec4"><h3 class="title">Types</h3>
<p class="noindent">Euthanasia can be classified in different ways, including:</p>
<p class="noindent"><bold>Active euthanasia:</bold> Where a person deliberately intervenes to end someone's life-for example, by injecting them with a large dose of sedatives.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p class=""><bold>Passive euthanasia:</bold> Where a person causes death by withholding or withdrawing treatment that is necessary to maintain life, such as withholding antibiotics from someone with pneumonia.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Voluntary euthanasia:</bold> Where a person makes a conscious decision to die and asks for help to do this.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Non-voluntary euthanasia:</bold> Where a person is unable to give their consent (for example, because they are in a coma or are severely brain damaged) and another person takes the decision on their behalf, often because the ill person previously expressed a wish for their life to be ended in such circumstances.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Involuntary euthanasia:</bold> Where a person is killed against their expressed wishes.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Self-administered euthanasia:</bold> The patient administers the means of death.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Other-administered euthanasia:</bold> A person other than the patient administers the means of death.</p>
<p class=""><ul style="list-style-type: square">
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Assisted:</span> The patient administers the means of death but with the assistance of another person, such as a physician. There are many possible combinations of the above types, and many types of euthanasia are morally controversial. Some types of euthanasia, such as assisted voluntary forms, are legal in some countries.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Mercy-killing:</span> The term “mercy-killing” usually refers to active, involuntary or nonvoluntary, other-administered euthanasia. In other words, someone kills a patient without their explicit consent to end the patient's suffering.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Physician-assisted suicide:</span> The phrase “physician-assisted suicide” refers to active, voluntary, assisted euthanasia where a physician assists the patient. A physician provides the patient with a means, such as sufficient medication, for the patient to kill him or herself.</p></li>
</ul>
</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch11lev3sec5"><h3 class="title">Suggested Conditions</h3>
<p class="noindent">The following criteria should be ensuring for implementing legal euthanasia.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Individual must be at least 18 years old.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The person should be Hong Kong permanent residents to prevent death tourism.<a name="page496"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">496</span></span></p></li>
<li><p class="">The person must suffer from unbearable physical or psychological suffering, dead-end medical situation or terminal phase of illness.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The request for euthanasia must be voluntary, informed, well-considered, and free from coercion and external pressure.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Individual should be competent to sign a written consent.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Mutual approval of a panel of experts including clinical psychologist, social worker, case nurse and two doctors is required.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch11lev2sec44"><h2 class="title">Nurses’ Roles in Euthanasia</h2>
<p class="noindent">Nurses are not the one conducting euthanasia, but they are involved in the process which begins when the patient requests for euthanasia and ends with providing support to the patient's relatives and healthcare colleagues after the act. It is vital for nurses to know their role during the process. Nurses should be open-minded and non-judgmental to accept the euthanasia request as nurses’ professional attitude could discourage patient from euthanasia. Nurses’ role in euthanasia can be divided into three phases.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch11lev3sec6"><h3 class="title">Phase I: Pre-Euthanasia</h3>
<p class="noindent">This is the initial phase of euthanasia from receiving a euthanasia request to sign a written consent. It will be consisted of assessment, consultation and written consent during this phase.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch11lev4sec1"><h4 class="title">Assessment</h4>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Nurses should listen to the patient carefully, to assess the underlying reasons for requesting euthanasia and the factors contributing to the decision.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Improper requests which originate from relievable suffering should be withdrawn and provide alternative methods for the patient to avoid undignified deaths.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Also, patients should be assessed the knowledge regarding his or her medical diagnosis, condition, prognosis and other available alternatives, including palliative care to ensure the decision is well-informed as full disclosure is important in executing the right to self-determination freely.</p></li>

<p class="noindent">There are two types of organ donation:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p class=""><bold>Living donor organ donation:</bold> A person during his life can donate one kidney (the other kidney is capable of maintaining the body functions adequately for the donor), a portion of pancreas (half of the pancreas is adequate for sustaining pancreatic functions) and a part of the liver (the segments of liver will regenerate after a period of time in both recipient and donor).</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Deceased donor organ donation:</bold> A person can donate multiple organ and tissues after (brainstem/cardiac) death. His/her organ continues to live in another person's body.</p></li>

</div>
<div class="section" id="ch11lev2sec47"><h2 class="title">Age Limit for Organ Donation</h2>
<p class="noindent">Age limit for organ donation varies, depending upon whether it is living donation or cadaver donation; for example in living donation, person should be above 18 years of age, and for most of the organs deciding factor is the person's physical condition and not the age. Specialist healthcare professionals decide which organs are suitable case to case. Organs and tissue from people in their 70s and 80s have been transplanted successfully all over the world. In the case of tissues and eyes, age usually does not matter. A deceased donor can generally donate the Organs and Tissues with the age limit of:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Kidneys, liver:</bold> Up to 70 years</p></li>

<p class="noindent">A mortuary is a room or area, often in a hospital, where dead bodies are kept <bold>(<a href="#ch11fig8" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 11.8</a>)</bold>. During preservation and disposal of dead bodies, almost care must be taken as it can lead to exchange of dead bodies due to wrong identification. Identification of body is the responsibility of the relative and police in medicolegal cases. In hospital set up, there is a need for awareness regarding the standard procedure to be followed for storage and disposal of dead body. In this respect the mortuary had an important role. So in this article, we will discuss the guidelines in relation to storage and disposal of dead bodies, considering various medicolegal aspects.</p>
<div class="figure" id="ch11fig8" data-label="Fig. 11.8"><div class="title"><span class="item-label">Fig. 11.8</span> Mortuary.</div><img alt="Fig. 11.8" src="/MediumImage/499-1.jpg"><div class="additional-markup"></div></div>
<p class="indent">It is the responsibility of every hospital to dispose of the dead body in a proper way. Therefore, it is necessary to have a clear guideline regarding the preservation and disposal of the dead body taking into consideration the medicolegal aspects in various situations and circumstances. The procedure and legal rules may vary from state to state.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch11lev2sec52"><h2 class="title">Preservation of Dead Body</h2>
<p class="noindent">Mortuary is an important integral part of every hospital as it deals with the preservation of the dead body so that the pathologist (clinical or forensic) may investigate the cause of death and make other scientific investigations; bodies may be viewed and identified by relatives and friends (unidentified body), and bodies may be kept until burial can be arranged. The mortuary should preferably be near the pathology department and easily accessible from the ward and emergency department. A hearse approach, screened from the view of patients and public, is essential.</p>
<p class="indent">The types of dead body preserved in the mortuary can be classified as:</p>
<div class="section" id="ch11lev3sec9"><h3 class="title">Nonmedicolegal</h3>

<p class="noindent">The maintenance of a full and accurate record of the body brought to the mortuary and its effect is one of the most important tasks of the mortuary technician. All morticians should keep a mortuary register. It is preferred to have a large heavy book that cannot be easily lost or removed. The following details of everybody brought into the mortuary should be recorded in this book:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Give a number to each body. This number runs consecutively in each year.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Name, sex, age of the deceased person.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Date and time of death</p></li>
<li><p class="">Identification marks of the deceased and finger impressions may also be noted.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Details of near relatives, e.g., name, relationship, address and phone number should be noted. Whether or not an autopsy was carried out.</p></li>
<li><p class="">If autopsy done, then date and time of autopsy and name of the autopsy surgeon.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Date and time when the body is placed in the cold storage.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Length of the body and breadth across the shoulder (helps in making coffin of correct size).</p></li>
<li><p class="">A list of valuables, which have not been removed from the body such as rings, bangles and others.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Signature of the mortuary technician who allows body to be taken away.</p></li>

<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">The proper maintenance of the cold storage room is an important responsibility of the concerned hospital authority and the mortuary technician. The body should not be brought directly into the cold storage room of the mortuary.</p></li>
<li><p class="">There should been open space outside the cold storage room, where the bodies can be brought in, to wait for preparation of the cold storage tray.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The bodies should be brought to the morgue on stretcher and preferably be left on the stretcher in the cold room until disposed off.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Ideally, one body cabin is better than two or three bodies in one cabin which can lead to in-efficient working and occasionally to the confusion of one body with another.</p></li>
<li><p class="">As a general rule, four cold storage cabins for each hundred beds in hospital is quite sufficent, excluding any provision for special circumstances like disaster, with some allowance for epidemics and the possibility of major accident.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Within the cold storage area doors should be wide enough to allow easy entry and exit of corpses.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The room should lead to the entrance area into the autopsy room. It is better to have a room with cold storage on each side, opening into a central wide area.<a name="page500"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">500</span></span> Each cold storage door should bear a holder for an identification ticket.</p></li>

The ward sister will keep one copy of dead body receipt slip from one of the death report forms before sending the 2 copies of the death report form to the central admission and enquiry office (which is otherwise taken by the mortuary staff along with the dead body shifted to the mortuary).</p></li>
<li><p class="">The procedure followed in such cases will essentially remain the same, i.e., after the death of a patient, his/her attendant will go to central admission and enquiry office (after clearing bills, etc.) from where he will get a dead body receipt slip with stamp “Body may be handed over”.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The patient's attendants will now approach the ward sister (instead of the mortuary) and she will take their signatures accepting the receipt of the dead body in her death register (In place of signatures of mortuary attendant who would have signed if the body was to be taken to mortuary).</p></li>
<li><p class="">The ward sister will keep the dead body receipt slip (with stamp from central admission office) in her records and will give dead body receipt slip kept with her from second copy of death report form (which is otherwise taken by the mortuary attendant along with the dead body and is given by him to the patient's attendant along with the body) while retaining the dead body receipt slip (with stamp from central admission office) in her records.</p></li>
<li><p class="">However, in all such cases, the relatives have to be gently advised to complete the formalities and remove the patient's body within one hour of the declaration of the death; otherwise the body may be sent to the mortuary. This discretion will remain with the ward sister, who may request the mortuary to take dead body of a non-MLC patient as well.</p></li>

<p class="noindent">Tue term “autopsy” derives from the Greek word “to see for oneself”. “Necropsy” is from the Greek for seeing a dead body”. Necropsy is the term for a postmortem examination on an animal. An autopsy also knows as a postmortem examination, necropsy or obduction.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch11lev2sec63"><h2 class="title">Definition</h2>
<p class="noindent">Autopsy is a medical procedure that consists of a thorough examination of a dead body to determine the cause and manner of death and to evaluate any disease or injury that may be present. It is usually performed by a specialized medical doctor called a pathologist.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch11lev2sec64"><h2 class="title">Classification</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p class=""><bold>Forensic:</bold> This is done for medical legal purposes. No family permission is required to complete this type of autopsy. This is carried out when the cause of death may be a criminal matter such as accident, burns.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Clinical/academic:</bold> This is usually performed in hospitals for research and study purposes. For a clinical autopsy to take place a cause of death must have already been established and a death certificate completed. To complete this type of autopsy, permission from the deceased's legal next of kin is required.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Coroner's:</bold> This type of autopsy involves cases where no medical cause of death is readily available. Cause, manner and mechanism of death are in question. Eventually, the prospectors will identify whether the cases deserve comprehensive forensic autopsy or a routine postmortem.</p></li>

</div><div class="section" id="ch11lev1sec27"><h1 class="title">EMBALMING</h1>
<p class="noindent">Embalming is the art and science of preserving human remains by treating them (in its modern form with chemicals) to forestall decomposition. The intention is to keep them suitable for public display at a funeral, for religious reasons, or for medical and scientific purposes such as their use as anatomical specimens. The three goals of embalming are sanitization, presentation and preservation (or restoration). Embalming has a very long and cross-cultural history, with many cultures giving the embalming processes a greater religious meaning.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch11lev2sec68"><h2 class="title">Concept of Embalming</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">The body taken for embalming should be identified properly beyond doubt and proper consent from a near relative or from the person in lawful possession of the dead body is necessary.</p></li>
<li><p class="">It would also be accompanied by death certificate, postmortem certificate, if postmortem was done and no objection certificate from police.</p></li>
<li><p class="">In foreign nationals, clearance from respective embassy is necessary.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Embalming should not be done before autopsy (where autopsy is necessary) as it destroys the medicolegal evidence, especially in poisoning death, by hindering its detection's in viscera.</p></li>
<li><p class="">On completion of embalming, a certificate is issued by a competent authority (embalmer). This certificate is prerequisite for transportation of the body.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Embalming is necessary to prevent putrefaction in case the relative wants to keep the body for longer time.</p></li>
<li><p class="">In case of anatomical embalming it helps in the preservation and sterilization of the body besides making it suitable for dissection.</p></li>
<li><p class="">It is not necessary to keep the embalmed body in the cold storage.<a name="page504"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">504</span></span></p></li>
<li><p class="">Dehydration and hardening is a common complication in the embalmed bodies kept in the cold storage in a tropical country.</p></li>
<li><p class="">For transporting the deal body, a watertight coffin is recommended by the railways and air service department.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch11lev2sec69"><h2 class="title">Definition</h2>
<p class="noindent">Embalming is the process of sanitizing and preserving human remains to render them as safe as possible for handling while retaining naturalness of tissue for funeral viewing purposes. An embalmer is one who is trained in the art and science of embalming.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch11lev2sec70"><h2 class="title">Steps of Embalming Process</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p class=""><bold>Arterial embalming:</bold> Which involves the injection of embalming chemicals into the blood vessels, usually via the right common carotid artery? Blood is displaced from the right jugular vein. The embalming solution is injected with a centrifugal pump and the embalmer massages the corpse to break up clots as to ensure the proper distribution of the embalming fluid. In case of poor circulation, other injection points are used.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Cavity embalming:</bold> The suction of the internal fluids of the corpse and injection of embalming chemicals into body cavities, using an aspirator and trocar. The embalmer makes a small incision just above the navel and pushes the trocar in the chest and stomach cavities to puncture the hollow organs and aspirate their contents. He then fills the cavities with concentrated chemicals that contain formaldehyde. The incision is either sutured closed or a “trocar button” is screwed into place.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Hypodermic embalming:</bold> The injection of embalming chemicals under the skin as needed.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Surface embalming:</bold> Which supplements the other methods, especially for visible, injured body parts? Atypical embalming takes one or two hours. An embalming case that requires more attention could take longer.</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch11lev2sec71"><h2 class="title">Embalming Chemicals</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">These are variety of preservation, sanitizers, disinfectant agents and additives used in modern embalming.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The purpose is to temporarily delay decomposition and restore a natural appearance for viewing a body after death.</p></li>
<li><p class="">A mixture of these chemicals is known as embalming fluid and is used to preserve deceased, sometimes only until the funeral, other times indefinitely.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Typical embalming fluid contains a mixture of formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde, methanol, ethanol, and other solvents.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The formaldehyde content generally ranges from 5 to 35% and ethanol content may range from 9 to 56%.</p></li>
</ul>

</div><div class="section" id="ch11lev1sec28"><h1 class="title">NURSES ROLE IN CARE OF DYING PATIENTS</h1>
<p class="noindent">Nurses role is important in the care of dying patients. Cassem and Stewart detailed essential features of the delivery of care to dying patients. These include:</p>
<div class="section" id="ch11lev2sec72"><h2 class="title">Competence</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Skillful treaters allay anxiety and allow the best possible medical outcome. Just because a person has terminal illness does not mean that clinicians should not use their highest level of medical skill to maximize comfort and reduce distress.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Competent treaters use their skills to optimize pain control, to treat comorbid reversible medical conditions, and to consider psychiatric diagnoses.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Dying patients are greatly comforted when they feel that their physician is knowledgeable and has developed a comprehensive plan of care.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch11lev2sec73"><h2 class="title">Concern</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Much is taught about the need to protect oneself against becoming “too wrapped up” in the care of one's patients. However, true empathy and connection are necessary to provide good care for such patients, and rather than be avoided, such traits should be standard doctor's tools used to cure, to soothe, and to improve the lives of patients.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Often, family members and patients may avoid talking about painful feelings of impending loss.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Treaters, by discussing their own feelings about the patient's loss and by asking how others are dealing with the impending loss during meetings with patients and families, can show their own concern and allow patients and families to grow closer.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch11lev2sec74"><h2 class="title">Comfort</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">A primary issue. Physical discomfort can contribute to psychological distress and inhibit a healthy grief process.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Assessment and treatment of pain should be complete and thorough.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Treatment of pain with narcotics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), adjunctive agents, acupuncture, biofeedback, and other remedies is crucial in the care of the dying.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Treatment of low energy, shortness of breath, and psychiatric symptoms is also key.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Where patients go to spend their final days is another vital issue that can either enhance the final days of life or make them uncomfortable.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch11lev2sec75"><h2 class="title">Communication</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Communication with the dying should focus far more on the art of listening than on the art of speaking.<a name="page505"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">505</span></span></p></li>
<li><p class="">When the treater does speak, it should be to help patients tell the story of their life (their accomplishments, their interests, their regrets, their hopes, the people in their life, and the details of their spiritual life).</p></li>
<li><p class="">By spending time with a patient, by listening intently, and by helping the patient make meaning of life and death, a treater can facilitate therapeutic communication.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div><div class="section" id="ch11lev1sec29"><h1 class="title">CONCLUSION</h1>
<p class="noindent">The role of the nurse is often associated with healing and helping bring people back to health. While this is a large aspect of the nursing profession, the nurse also cares for patients who are dying. The care delivered at this time revolves around the comfort of the patient, as well as ensuring that all of the patient's needs are met, including any cultural or spiritual needs. In order for the care of the patient to transition from curative to comfort measures, it is necessary for a diagnosis of dying to be made. This diagnosis should then be communicated with the patient and family. When the diagnosis of death is not communicated in a timely manner, it has been found that the patient's do not receive quality end of life care. This diagnosis surpasses all other diagnoses and shifts the focus towards the comfort and well-being of the patient. Care at the end of life includes pain management, discontinuation of routine vital signs and laboratory tests and coordinating care with other professionals to ensure the best quality care is being offered.</p>
<p class="indent">The role of the nurse extends into many realms of the healthcare setting. During the end of life, nurses are present for bedside care, members of the consultation team, and case managers. End of life care can occur in in-patient acute care settings, residential hospices, skilled-nursing facilities, and the patient's home. During this time, the registered nurse has a changed mindset from interventions and treatments to one of comfort, support and symptoms management. Nursing care at the end of life is based on providing quality and competent care for the patient that is centered on their comfort. This often includes discontinuing any medications and tests that are unnecessary and may be uncomfortable for the patient, including routine vital signs, laboratory draws, or frequent oral medications. Providers would have orders for pain management to be delivered to the patient via intravenous routes as needed. In many cases, patients near the end of death may not be able to verbalize their pain or their symptoms. It is important for the nurse to understand common signs of pain, such as grimacing, moaning, or being restless. It is often said that hearing is the last sense to leave us, and the same is true for the semi-comatose patient at the end of life. It is important that the nurse and family communicate to the patient when anything such as medication administration, turning or repositioning is being done. This helps keep the patient calm and oriented for as long as possible.</p>
