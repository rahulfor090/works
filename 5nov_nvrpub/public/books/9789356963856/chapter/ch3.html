<p class="noindent">Nutrition is the science of food values. It is relatively a new science, which was evolved from chemistry and physiology. The effect of food in our body is explained in nutrition. In other words, nutrition is defined as food at work in the body. In a broader sense nutrition is defined as “the science of foods, the nutrients and other substances their action, interaction, and balance in relationship to health and diseases, the process by which the organism ingests, digests, absorbs, transport and utilizes nutrients and dispose off their end products, in addition nutrition must be concerned with the social, economic, cultural and psychological implication of food and eating.”</p>

<li><p class="">Supplies nutrients to build and maintain body tissues, nutrients needed in building and maintaining body are proteins, minerals and water.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Supplies nutrients needed for regulatory body processes. All the nutrients, except carbohydrates, play an important role in the regulation of body process, such as circulation of food, maintenance of body temperature and digestion, etc.</p></li>
</ul>
</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Social function:</bold> Food is served at many social events, such as teas, breakfasts, banquets, athletic award dinners, dances and meeting of all sorts. On all these occasions, food indirectly serves as an instrument to develop social support <bold>(<a href="#ch3box2" class="ulink-inter">Box 3.2</a>)</bold>.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Psychological function:</bold> Besides other functions, food satisfies certain emotional needs also. People often find it difficult to get adjusted to unfamiliar food, although it may be nutritionally sound. Traditional habits are characterized by certain foods, which are pleasing to persons of one culture and distasteful those of another.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Relationship of food to main functions:</bold> Nutrition does the process or an activity by which the human body receives and uses all the food necessary for its growth, development and functions or activities.
<ul style="list-style-type: square">
<li><p class="">Food supplies heat and energy for work and play.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Food supplies materials for growth and repair of the body.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Food supplies materials for regulation or control of body process and for protection of the body.

<div class="section" id="ch3lev3sec1"><h3 class="title">Physiological Functions of Food</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p class=""><bold>Energy yielding foods:</bold> Foods rich in carbohydrates and fats are called energy yielding foods. They provide energy to sustain the involuntary processes essential for continuance of life, to carry out various professional, household and recreational activities and to convert food ingested into usable nutrients in the body. The energy needed is supplied by the oxidation of foods consumed. Cereals, roots and tubers, dried fruits, oils, butter and ghee are all good sources of energy.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Body building foods:</bold> Foods rich in protein are called body building foods. Milk, meat, eggs and fish are rich in proteins of high quality. Pulses and nuts are good sources of protein but the protein is not of high quality. These foods help to maintain life and promote growth. They also supply energy.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Protective and regulatory foods:</bold> Foods rich in protein, minerals and vitamins are known as protective and regulatory foods. They are essential for health and regulate activities, such as maintenance of body temperature, muscle contraction, control of water balance, clotting of blood, removal of waste products from the body and maintaining heartbeat. Milk, egg, liver, fruits and vegetables are protective foods.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Social functions of food:</bold> Food has always been the central part of our community, social, cultural and religious life. It has been an expression of love, friendship and happiness at religious, social and family get-togethers.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Psychological functions of food:</bold> In addition to satisfying physical and social needs, foods also satisfy certain emotional needs of human beings. These include a sense of security, love and acceptance. For example, preparation of delicious foods for family members is a token of love and affection.</p></li>

<p class="noindent">Nutritional anthropometry is concerned with the measurements of the variations of physical dimensions and body composition at stages of life cycle and different planes of nutrition. It is a field-oriented method, which can be easily adopted and interpreted. The basic measurements which should be made on all age groups are weight in kg, length/height and arm circumference in cm. In young children, it should be supplemented by measurements of head and chest circumference.</p>

<li><p class=""><bold>Weight:</bold> Weight gain is an indicator of growth in children. It is measured with the help of the weighing scale. Body weight should be determined after the first void and before ingestion of food.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Anthropometric indices: Weight for age—</bold>the nutritional status can be interpreted using Gomez classification as follows:
<ul style="list-style-type: square">
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Weight</span>
<ul style="list-style-type: arrow">
<li><p class=""><bold>&gt;</bold>90% weight for age. Normal.</p></li>
<li><p class="">76–90% weight for age. Grade I malnutrition.</p></li>
<li><p class="">61 &lt;75% weight for age. Grade II malnutrition.</p></li>
<li><p class="">&lt;60% weight for age. Grade III malnutrition.</p></li></ul></p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Linear measurements</span>: Two types of linear measurements are commonly used:
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p class="">Height or length of the whole body</p></li>
<li><p class="">Circumference of the head and the chest
<ul style="list-style-type: arrow">
<li><p class="">Height: The height of the individual is the sum of four components—leg, pelvis, spine and skull. For infants and children recumbent length (crown-heel length) is measured. The measurement is compared with the standards of the ICMR as to assess nutritional status.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The desirable birth weight and length of an infant is 3 kg and 50 cm respectively. By the time, the baby turns the first birth day, the birth weight is doubled and an increment of 25 cm in length is reached.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Head circumference: The measurement of head circumference is a standard procedure to detect pathological condition in children. Head circumference is related mainly to brain size. At birth, the circumference of head is greater than that of the chest.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Chest circumference: The circumference of the head and the chest are about the same at six months of age. After this, the skull grows slowly and the chest more rapidly. Therefore, between the ages of six months and five years the chest/head circumference ratio of less than one may be due to failure to develop or due to wasting of muscle and fat of chest. In nutritional anthropometry, the chest/head circumference ratio is of value in detecting under nutrition in early childhood.</p>

<li><p class=""><bold>Mid upper arm circumference (MUAC):</bold> Mid upper arm circumference at birth in a healthy child is between 10–11 cm. Over the first year, the increment in MUAC is 3 to 4 cm as the muscles of the arms start to develop. In the preschool age, the increase in MUAC is only one cm. Hence, there is not much difference between the MUAC of a 3 year old from that of a 5 year old. So MUAC is an age independent index. The field workers in nutrition in our country have fixed the desirable value for MUAC as 12 cm for Indian preschool children.</p></li>
</ul></p></li>
</ol>
</p></li>
</ul>
</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">The WHO has recommended 14 centimeter as a desirable value for MUAC for preschool children. Hence in screening malnourished children in a community, this method is used with ease. When the value of MUAC is less than 12 cm among 1–5 year old children, they are designated as malnourished. In the field condition, a bangle with a diameter of 4 centimeter can be used as a tool to detect malnutrition. When the bangle moves smoothly over the mid-upper arm of the child, it indicates malnutrition. The bangle test can be conducted with ease in field condition to screen malnourished children.</p>

<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Having knowledge and understanding will enable nurses to monitor food intake and observe for potential eating disorders.<a name="page107"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">107</span></span> Treatment will depend on an individual's symptoms and relate specifically to the individual problem.</p></li>
<li><p class="">It is essential to observe patients’ nutritional status as eating disorders can be life threatening. It is also important to ensure they maintain adequate nutrition and electrolyte balance. If an eating disorder has been identified, the nurse must monitor weight on a regular basis.</p></li>
<li><p class="">This can be achieved by encouraging the supervision of patients during and after mealtimes in order to prevent vomiting after eating. Setting time limits for each meal will help to set realistic expectations and encourage a relaxed atmosphere at mealtimes that will, in turn, help to reduce stress and anxiety.</p></li>
<li><p class="">It is essential to monitor patients’ elimination pattern as excessive use of diuretics and laxatives is common among patients with eating disorders. As a consequence, patients may require intervention to treat constipation.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Monitoring skin condition for breakdown and poor healing is an important part of the nurse's role. A lack of protein, needed to aid tissue repair, makes the skin more likely to break down. In addition, it is vital that good oral hygiene is achieved as recurrent vomiting may cause dental problems.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Finally, it is important to monitor patients’ activity levels. With anorexia they may undertake excessive exercise that can be detrimental to their physiological state. Additionally, if they also have a physical illness, excessive exercise could slow their recovery.</p></li>

<p class="noindent">Many people require a soft diet simply because they have no teeth and such a diet is known as mechanical or a dental soft diet. It is not desirable to restrict the patient to the food selection of the customary soft diet and the following modifications to the normal diet may be made:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">

</div>
<div class="section" id="ch3lev2sec37"><h2 class="title">Normal Diet</h2>
<p class="noindent">It is used for ambulatory and bed patients whose conditions do not necessitate a special diet as one of the routine diets. Many special diets progress ultimately to a regular diet. The regular hospital diet is simple in character and preparation, easy of digestion and calculated to afford maximum nourishment with minimum effort to the body.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch3lev3sec12"><h3 class="title">Definition</h3>
<p class="noindent">Normal diet/regular diets are planned to meet the nutritional needs of adolescents, adults, and geriatric phases of the life span.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">The regular diet includes the basic food groups and a variety of foods. The basic food groups include meat, milk, vegetables, fruits, bread and cereal, fats, and sweets.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The standard menu mat, DA Form 2901-R (Regular diet) provides approximately 3375 calories. The selective menu is developed by each individual hospital according to patient needs, food availability, and cost. The regular diet is designed to provide exceptionally generous amounts of all recognized nutrients and meets or exceeds the RDA for all nutrients tabulated.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The Food Guide Pyramid is an outline of what we should eat each day. It shows six food groups, but emphasizes foods from the five food groups shown in the lower sections of the pyramid. You need food from each group for good health. Each of the food groups provides some of the nutrients you need. Food from one group cannot replace those of another group.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch3lev3sec13"><h3 class="title">Uses</h3>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">A normal diet is defined as one which consists. of any and all foods eaten by a person in health.</p></li>
<li><p class="">It is planned keeping the basic food groups in mind so that optimum amounts of all nutrients are provided. As there is no restriction of any kind of food, this diet is well balanced and nutritionally adequate.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Since the patient is hospitalized and/or is at bed rest, a reduction of 10% in energy intake should be made and too many fatty foods and fried foods be avoided as they are difficult to digest.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The proteins are slightly increased (+10%) to counteract a negative nitrogen balance. All other nutrients are supplied in normal amounts.</p></li>

<div class="section" id="ch3lev2sec38"><h2 class="title">Diabetic Diet</h2>
<p class="noindent">The diabetic diet is indicated in the treatment of the metabolic disorder diabetes mellitus. This disease results from an inadequate production or utilization of insulin. The object of treating the diabetic patient by diet, with/without insulin or oral drugs, is to prevent hyperglycemia, hypoglycemia, glycosuria, and ketosis.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">The diabetic food exchange lists are the basis for a meal planning system that was designed by a committee of the American Diabetes Association and The American Dietetic Association.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The system lists—Meat exchange, bread exchange, fruit and juice exchange, vegetable exchange, milk exchange and fat exchange.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The number of exchanges allowed is based upon the doctor's order and the dietitian's calculations.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Each diabetic diet should be individualized to meet the needs of the patient. The foods in each exchange contain the same amount of calories, carbohydrate, protein, and fat per portion size. Patients select from the exchange based upon their preference.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The adequacy and possible deficiencies depend on the calories. A diet of less than 1200 calories for women and less than 1500 calories for men would have a great chance of being deficient in some nutrients.</p></li>
</ul>

<div class="section" id="ch3lev2sec39"><h2 class="title">Liberal Bland Diet</h2>
<p class="noindent">This diet is indicated for any medical condition requiring treatment for the reduction of gastric secretion, such as gastric or duodenal ulcers, gastritis, esophagitis, or hiatal hernia.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">The diet consists of any variety of regular foods and beverages, which are prepared or consumed without black pepper, chili powder, or chili pepper. Chocolate, coffee, tea, caffeine-containing products, and decaffeinated coffee are not included in the diet. The diet should be as liberal as possible and individualized to meet the needs of the patient. Foods, which cause the patient discomfort, should be avoided. Small, frequent feedings may be prescribed to lower the acidity of the gastric content and for the physical comfort of the patient.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>The standard menu mat:</bold> The liberal bland diet is slightly below the RDA for thiamine and niacin for men 19 to 22 years of age. It is also below the RDA in iron for women of all ages.</p></li>
</ul>

<div class="section" id="ch3lev2sec41"><h2 class="title">Sodium Restricted Diet</h2>
<p class="noindent">The purpose of the sodium-restricted diet is to promote loss of body fluids for patients who are unable to excrete the element normally because of a pathological condition. The diet is indicated for the prevention, control, and elimination of edema in congestive heart failure; cirrhosis of the liver with ascites; renal disease complicated by either edema or hypertension; when administration of adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) or steroids are prescribed, and for certain endocrine disorders, such as Cushing's disease and hypothyroidism. <bold><a href="#ch3fig22" class="ulink-inter">Figure 3.22</a></bold> depicts the low sodium diet chart.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">The sodium-restricted diets provide a specific sodium level or a range of sodium. The diet order must indicate the specific sodium level or range desired either in milligrams (mg) or mill equivalent (mEq). Terms, such as “salt free” and “low sodium” are not sufficient.</p></li>
<li><p class="">All foods on the 500 mg and 1000 mg sodium diets are prepared without the addition of salt, and foods high in sodium are omitted. The 500 mg sodium diet uses both sodium restricted bread and margarine. The 1000 mg sodium diet uses sodium restricted margarine and regular bread. The 2000 mg sodium diet uses regular bread and margarine, and regular cereal and desserts prepared with sodium.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The diets are below the RDA in iron for males ages 11 to 22 and for females ages 11 to 50. Thiamine is inadequate for males at all levels.

<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Gastric decompression:</bold> The nasogastric tube is connected to suction to facilitate decompression by removing stomach contents. Gastric decompression is indicated for bowel obstruction and paralytic ileus and when surgery is performed on the stomach or intestine.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Aspiration of gastric fluid content:</bold>Either for lavage or obtaining a specimen for analysis. It will also allow for drainage or lavage in drug over dosage or poisoning.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Feeding and administration of medication:</bold> Introducing a passage into the GI tract will enable a feeding and administration of various medications. NG tubes can also be used for enteral feeding initially.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Prevention of vomiting and aspiration:</bold> In trauma settings, NG tubes can be used to aid in the prevention of vomiting and aspiration, as well as for assessment of GI bleeding.</p></li>

<div class="section" id="ch3lev3sec22"><h3 class="title">Preparation</h3>
<p class="noindent">Unlike the person that will perform the procedure, patients do not really have to prepare for an NG intubation or feeding. However, a patient may need to blow their nose and take a few sips of water (if allowed) before the procedure. Once the tube is inserted into the nostril, the patient may need to swallow or drink water to help ease the NG tube through the esophagus.</p>

<div class="section" id="ch3lev2sec51"><h2 class="title">Steps in Inserting a Nasogastric Tube (<a href="#ch3fig26" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 3.26</a>)</h2>
<p class="noindent">Listed below is the step-by-step procedure in inserting a nasogastric tube.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p class=""><bold>Review the physician's order and know the type, size, and purpose of the NG tube:</bold> It is widely acceptable to use a size 16 or 18 French for adults while sizes suitable for children vary from a very small size 5 French for children to size 12 French for older children.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Check the client's identification band:</bold> Just like in administering medications, it is very important to be sure that the procedure is being carried out on the right client.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Gather equipment, set up tube-feeding equipment or suction equipment mentioned above:</bold> This is to make sure that the equipment is functioning properly before using it on the client.</p>
<p class=""><div class="figure" id="ch3fig26" data-label="Fig. 3.26"><div class="title"><span class="item-label">Fig. 3.26</span> Nasogastric tube insertion technique.</div><img alt="Fig. 3.26" src="/MediumImage/120-2.jpg"><div class="additional-markup"></div></div><a name="page121"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">121</span></span></p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Briefly explain the procedure to the client and assess his capability to participate:</bold> It is not advisable to explain the procedure too far in advance because the client's anxiety about the procedure may interfere with its success. It is important that the client relax, swallow, and cooperate during the procedure.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Observe proper hand washing and don non-sterile gloves:</bold> Clean, not sterile, technique is necessary because the gastrointestinal (GI) tract is not sterile.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Position client upright or in full Fowler's position if possible:</bold> Place a clean towel over the client's chest. Full Fowler's position assists the client to swallow, for optimal neck-stomach alignment and promotes peristalsis. A towel is used as a covering to protect bed linens and the client's gown.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Measure tubing from bridge of nose to earlobe, then to the point halfway between the end of the sternum and the navel:</bold> Mark this spot with a small piece of temporary tape or note the distance. Each client will have a slightly different terminal insertion point. Measurements must be made for each individual's anatomy.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Wipe the client's face and nose with a wet towel:</bold> Wipe down the exterior of the nose with an alcohol swab. The NG tube will stay more secure if taped on a clean, non-oily nose. If the nose has been cleaned with an alcohol swab, the tape will stay more secure and the tube will not move in the throat—causing gagging or discomfort later.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Cover the client's eyes with a cloth:</bold> This protects the client's eyes from any alcohol fumes from the alcohol swab.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Examine nostrils for deformity or obstruction by closing one nostril and then the other and asking the client to breathe through the nose for each attempt:</bold> If the client has difficulty breathing out of one nostril, try to insert the NG tube in that one. The client may breathe more comfortably if the “good” nostril remains patent. The blocked nasal passage may not be totally occluded and thus you may still be able to pass an NG tube. It may be necessary to use the more patent nostril for insertion.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Lubricate 4 to 8 inches of the tub with a water-soluble lubricant:</bold> The NG intubation is very uncomfortable for many patients, so a squirt of Xylocaine jelly in the nostril, and a spray of Xylocaine to the back of the throat will help alleviate the discomfort.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Flex the client's head forward, tilt the tip of the nose upward and pass the tube gently into the nose to as far as the back of the throat. Guide the tube straight back. Flexing the head aids in the anatomic insertion of the tube. The tube is less likely to pass into the trachea.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Once the tube reaches the nasopharynx, allow the client lower his head slightly. Ask the assistant to hold the glass of water. Ready the emesis basin and tissues. The positioning helps the passage of the NG to follow anatomic landmarks. Swallowing water, if allowed, helps the passage of the NG tube.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Instruct the client to swallow as the tube advances. Advance the tube until the correct marked position on the tube is reached. Encourage the client to breathe through his mouth. Swallowing of small sips of water may enhance passage of tube into the stomach rather than the trachea.</p></li>
<li><p class="">If changes occur in patient's respiratory status, if tube coils in mouth, if the patient begins to cough or turns cyanotic, withdraw the tube immediately. The tube may be in the trachea.</p></li>
<li><p class="">If obstruction is felt, pull out the tube and try the other nostril. The client's nostril may deflect the NG into an inappropriate position. Let the client rest a moment and retry on the other side.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Advance the tube as far as the marked insertion point. Place a temporary piece of tape across the nose and tube. In this way, you can check for placement before securing the tube. The tube may move out of position if not secured before checking for placement.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Check the back of the client's throat to make sure that the tube is not curled in the back of the throat. On instance, the NG will curl up in the back of the throat instead of passing down to the stomach. Visual inspection is needed in this situation. Withdraw the entire tube and start again if such thing occurred.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Check tube placements with these methods. Check the tube for correct placement by at least two and preferably three of the following methods:
<ul style="list-style-type: square">
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Aspirate stomach contents:</span> Stomach aspirate will appear cloudy, green, tan, off-white, bloody, or brown. It is not always visually possible to distinguish between stomach and respiratory aspirates. Special note—the small diameters of some NG tubes make aspiration problematic. The tubes themselves collapse when suction is applied via the syringe. Thus, contents cannot be aspirated.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Check pH of aspirate</span>: Measuring the pH of stomach aspirate is considered more accurate than visual inspection. Stomach aspirate generally has a pH range of 0 to 4, commonly less than 4. The aspirate of respiratory contents is generally more alkaline, with a pH of 7 or more.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Inject 30 mL of air</span> into the stomach and listen with the stethoscope for the “whoosh” of air into the stomach. The small diameter of some NG tubes may make it difficult to hear air entering the stomach.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Confirm by X-ray placement</span>: X-ray visualization is the only method that is considered positive.</p></li>
</ul>
</p></li>
<li><p class="">Secure the tube with tape or commercially prepared tube holder once stomach placement has been confirmed. It is very important to ensure that the NG tube is in its correct place within the stomach because, if by accident the NG is within the trachea, serious complications in relation to the lungs would appear. Securing the tube in place will prevent peristaltic movement from advancing the tube or from the tube unintentionally being pulled out.<a name="page122"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">122</span></span></p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch3lev2sec52"><h2 class="title">Methods to Confirm NG Tube in the Stomach</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Aspirate:</bold> Attach the syringe to the end of NG tube and aspirate small amount of gastric contents.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Immerse distal end of tube:</bold> Into bowel of water and check for air bubbles. If the tube is in the trachea, air bubbles will coincide with the expiration of each breath.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Auscultate:</bold> Attach syringe to free end of NG tube, place diaphragm of stethoscope over left hypochondrium. Inject 10 mL of air and auscultate abdomen for gushing sound.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch3lev2sec53"><h2 class="title">After Care</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Offer a mouthwash. Clean the face and hands and dry them.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Remove the Mackintosh and towel.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Make the patient comfortable in bed.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Take all the articles to the utility room discard the waste, clean it and replace it in a proper place.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Wash hands.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Record the procedure in the nurse's record sheet.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch3lev2sec54"><h2 class="title">Contraindications</h2>
<p class="noindent">Nasogastric tubes are contraindicated in the presence of severe facial trauma (cribriform plate disruption), due to the possibility of inserting the tube intracranially. In this instance, an orogastric tube may be inserted.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch3lev2sec55"><h2 class="title">Risks and Complications</h2>
<p class="noindent">As with most procedures, NG tube insertion is not all beneficial to the patient as certain risks and complications are involved:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Aspiration:</bold> The main complication of NG tube insertion includes aspiration.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Discomfort:</bold> A conscious patient may feel a little discomfort while the NG tube is passed through the nostril and into the stomach which can induce gagging or vomiting. Suction should always be present and ready to be used in this case.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Trauma:</bold> The tube can injure the tissue inside the sinuses, throat, esophagus, or stomach if not properly inserted.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Wrong placement:</bold> Unwanted scenarios, such as wrong placement of an NG tube into the lungs will allow food and medicine pass through it that may be fatal to the patient.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Other complications include—abdominal cramping or swelling from feedings that are too large, diarrhea, regurgitation of the food or medicine, a tube obstruction or blockage, a tube perforation or tear, and tubes coming out of place and causing additional complications</p></li>
<li><p class="">An NG tube is meant to be used only for a short period of time. Prolonged use can lead to conditions, such as sinusitis, infections, and ulcerations on the tissue of your sinuses, throat, esophagus, or stomach.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch3lev2sec56"><h2 class="title">Nursing Considerations</h2>
<p class="noindent">The following are the nursing considerations you should watch out for:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Provide oral and skin care:</bold> Give mouth rinses and apply lubricant to the patient's lips and nostril. Using a water-soluble lubricant, lubricate the catheter until where it touches the nostrils because the client's nose may become irritated and dry.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Verify NG tube placement:</bold> Always verify if the NG tube placed is in the stomach by aspirating a small amount of stomach contents. An X-ray study is the best way to verify placement.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Wear gloves:</bold> Gloves must always be worn while starting an NG because potential contact with the patient's blood or body fluids increases especially with inexperienced operator.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Face and eye protection:</bold> On the other hand, face and eye protection may also be considered if the risk for vomiting is high. Trauma protocol calls for all team members to wear gloves, face and eye protection and gowns.</p></li>

<p class="noindent">Parenteral nutrition, also known as intravenous feeding, is a method of getting nutrition into the body through the veins. While it is most commonly referred to as total parenteral nutrition (TPN), some patients need to get only certain types of nutrients intravenously. Parenteral nutrition is often used for patients with Crohn's disease, cancer, short bowel syndrome, and ischemic bowel disease.</p>
<div class="figure" id="ch3fig30" data-label="Fig. 3.30"><div class="title"><span class="item-label">Fig. 3.30</span> Total parenteral nutrition .</div><img alt="Fig. 3.30" src="/MediumImage/127-1.jpg"><div class="additional-markup"></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ch3lev2sec87"><h2 class="title">Definition</h2>
<p class="noindent">Parenteral nutrition (PN) is sterile intravenous solution of protein, dextrose and fat in combination with electrolytes, vitamins, trace elements and water. PN is used to treat children who cannot be adequately fed by the oral or enteral route. <bold><a href="#ch3fig31" class="ulink-inter">Figure 3.31</a></bold> illustrates the administration of total parenteral nutrition.</p>
<p class="indent">TPN bypasses the normal way the body digests food in the stomach. It supplies the fuels the body needs directly into the blood stream through a central IV line. The body needs three kinds of fuel-carbohydrates, protein and fat.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Carbohydrates provide calories to the body. They supply most of the energy or fuel the body needs to run. The main energy source in TPN is dextrose (sugar).</p></li>
<li><p class="">Protein is made up of amino acids, which are the “building blocks” of life. The body uses protein to build muscle, repair tissue, fight infections and carry nutrients through the body.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Fat or Lipids are another source of calories and energy. Fat also helps carry vitamins in the blood stream. Fat supports and protects some of your organs and insulates your body against heat loss. Fat is white in color.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">TPN also contains other nutrients, such as vitamins and minerals, electrolytes and water.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Vitamins added to the TPN provide the needed daily amounts of vitamins A, B, C, D, E and K. It is the vitamins that are added to the TPN mixture that turns it yellow. The body also needs minerals. These minerals are zinc, copper, chromium, manganese and selenium. The vitamins and minerals in the TPN are needed for the body's growth and good health.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Electrolytes are important for bone, nerve, organ and muscle function. Electrolytes, such as calcium, potassium, phosphorus, magnesium, sodium, chloride and acetate, are also added to the TPN mixture.<a name="page128"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">128</span></span></p></li>
<li><p class="">Water is a vital part of TPN. It prevents patients from becoming dehydrated (too little fluid). The amount of water in the TPN is based on your child's height and weight.</p></li>

<li><p class="">Organize dietician review of nutritional state and estimated nutritional requirements (energy, protein and specific nutrient) or use equations to calculate basal metabolic rate and adjustments.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Consider access type (CVC or peripheral) and duration it will be needed. Only day 1 (10% dextrose) solutions can be run through a peripheral line. In general, the smallest caliber single lumen central line is preferable.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Perform baseline bloods (creatinine, urea and electrolytes, calcium magnesium and phosphate, liver function tests, full blood count, triglycerides, blood sugar, venous blood gas) and correct electrolyte abnormalities before starting PN. See drug doses for potassium, phosphate, and magnesium corrections. Corrections can often be given by the enteral route (e.g., potassium, phosphate) if the child is receiving other medications by this route.</p></li>

<li><p class="">Consider other fluids being given to the patient over 24 hours (antibiotics, other infusions, blood or albumin)</p></li>
<li><p class="">Determine the volume available for PN (total fluid volume requirement minus the volume required for other infusions).</p>
<p class="indent"><bold>Note</bold>: Sometimes the volume available may not be enough to provide adequate nutrition, especially in patients who are fluid restricted—other infusion volumes should be minimal volume, liaise with clinical nutrition team to ensure the patient is receiving adequate nutrition.</p></li>

<p class="noindent">The gastric analysis test examines the acidity of the gastric secretions in the basal state (without stimulation) and the maximal secretory ability (with stimulation, i.e., with histamine phosphate, betazole hydrochloride (histalog) indicate a peptic ulcer (stomach or duodenal), and an absence of free HCl (achlorhydria) could indicate gastric atrophy (possibly caused by gastric malignancy) or pernicious anemia. In addition, gastric contents can be collected for cytological examinations. Gastric analysis by tube (basal and stimulation) and tube less gastric analysis (urine examination after a resin dye and stimulant are administered) are the methods used for evaluating gastric secretions.</p>
<p class="indent"><bold><a href="#ch3tbl3" class="ulink-inter">Table 3.3</a></bold> outlines the major constituents of gastric secretions.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch3lev2sec92"><h2 class="title">Basal Gastric Analysis (Tube)</h2>
<p class="noindent">Gastric secretions are aspirated through a nasogastric tube after a period of fasting. Specimens are obtained to evaluate the basal acidity of the gastric content first and the gastric stimulation test follows.</p>

<div class="section" id="ch3lev2sec93"><h2 class="title">Stimulation Gastric Analysis (Tube)</h2>
<p class="noindent">The stimulation test is usually a continuation of the basal gastric analysis. After samples of gastric secretions are obtained, a gastric stimulant (i.e., histalog or pentagastrin) is administered, and gastric contents are aspirated every 15 to 20 minutes until several samples are obtained.</p>

<p class="noindent">This test is for screening purpose to detect the presence or absence of HCl; however, it will not indicate the amount of the free acid in the stomach. A gastric stimulant (caffeine, histalog) is given, and an hour later a resin dye (azuresin, diagnex blue) is taken orally by the client. The free HCl releases the dye from the resin base; the dye is absorbed by the gastrointestinal tract and is excreted in the urine. Absence of the dye in the urine 2 hours later is indicative of gastric achlorhydria. This test method saves the client the discomfort of being intubated with nasogastric tub; however, it does lack accuracy.</p>

<div class="section" id="ch3lev2sec99"><h2 class="title">Procedure</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">The client should be NPO for 8 hours to 12 hours prior to the test. Smoking should be restricted for hours.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Certain groups (i.e., anticholinergic, cholinergics, adrenergic blockers, antacid, and steroids) and alcohol and coffee should be restricted for at least 24 hours before the test. It should be noted on the request slip, if the drugs cannot be withheld.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Baseline vital signs should be recorded.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Loose dentures should be removed.</p></li>
<li><p class="">A lubricated nasogastric tube is inserted through the nose or mouth.</p></li>
<li><p class="">A residual gastric specimen and four additional specimens taken 15 minutes apart should be aspirated and labeled with the client's name, the time, and a specimen number. The nasogastric tube may be attached to low intermittent suction.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch3lev2sec100"><h2 class="title">Stimulation Test</h2>
<p class="noindent">A continuation of the basal gastric analysis.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">A gastric stimulant is administered (i.e., betazole hydrochloride (histalog) or histamine phosphate intramuscularly, pentagastrin subcutaneously).</p></li>
<li><p class="">Several gastric specimens are obtained over a period of 1 to 2 hours (histamine four 15-minute specimens in 1 hour and histalog eight 15-minute specimens in 2 hours). Specimens should be labeled with the client's name, the date, the time, and specimen numbers.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Vital signs should be monitored. Emergency drugs, such as epinephrine (adrenalin) should be available.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The test usually takes 2 and half hours for both parts (basal and stimulation).</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch3lev2sec101"><h2 class="title">Factors Affecting Diagnostic Results</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Incorrect labeling of specimens could affect test results.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Drugs antacids, anticholinergic, and histamine blockers (cimetidine, ranitidine) could decrease HCl levels; antacids, electrolyte and iron preparations, vitamin B complex, and quinidine could fastly elevate the diagnex blue level.</p></li>

<p class="noindent">Nutrition is defined as the science of food and its relationship to health. Nutrition is food at work in the body. It includes everything that happens to food. It is the study of nutrients and processes by which they are used by the body. It is concerned with the part played by nutrients in the body-growth, development and maintenance. Proper nutrition is important for staying healthy and is particularly vital for the elderly. The nutritional state of a patient often affects patient outcomes during illness and recovery. The nurse is the logical person to provide nutritional information because nurses are the primary interface between the patient and the healthcare system. Nursing plays a key role in nutrition education because nutrition is a part of patient outcomes. The healing of the body can take place only when the nutrients that provide the building blocks for repair are present. The nurse as a nutrition educator is a vital role in the overall healthcare system. Prehospital nursing has the opportunity to provide nutrition education that can help to preserve the health of all populations and particularly of older adults.</p>
