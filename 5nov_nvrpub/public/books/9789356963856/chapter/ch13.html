</div><div class="section" id="ch13lev1sec2"><h1 class="title">INTRODUCTION</h1>
<p class="noindent">Sexuality is an integral part of human life. Sexual health is an important indicator of both physical and mental health and is an essential component of general health. Sexual health is negatively affected by many factors including physical/mental health status, chronic illnesses, and surgery, changes in body structure or function. The impairment of sexual health paves the way for the emergence of sexual dysfunctions. Sexual dysfunctions lead to disruptive problems that lower self-confidence and self-esteem and impair interpersonal relationships. They can also develop as a secondary co-morbid condition due to an illness or treatment process whereas they can be a major health problem. For this reason, regardless of their diagnosis, it is important to create a setting in which the problems related to sex can be easily expressed by the patients/individuals who need care, to take sexuality seriously into consideration during the caring process, and to allocate more time for the protection of sexual health in patient education.</p>
</div><div class="section" id="ch13lev1sec3"><h1 class="title">DEFINITIONS</h1>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Sex is an essential part of person's health. WHO has defined as “Sexual health is an integration of the somatic, emotional, intellectual and social aspects of sexual-being, in ways that positively enrich and enhance the personality, communication and love”.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Sexuality has been defined as the part of life that has to do with being male or female. Sexuality in individual evolves and matures as an interactional process in a biologic environment influenced by family members, friends, and church, and culture, social and school factors.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Sexual health as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) is “… a state of physical, emotional, mental and social well-being in relation to sexuality...” (WHO) suggesting a whole child approach to sexual health education and not merely the absence of unplanned pregnancy or sexually transmitted infections.</p></li>

<li><p class="">Infants and young children have many other sensual experiences, including sucking on their fingers and toes.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The first intimate relationship that children experience is with the mother or the primary caretaker.</p></li>
<li><p class="">This relationship involves many of the tactile senses and includes being rocked and cuddled, being bathed, cleaned and diapered.</p></li>
<li><p class="">These experiences may establish preferences for certain kinds of stimulation that persist throughout life.</p></li>

<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">The experiences noted in this section form the basis of the first stage of Freud's psychosexual stages: the oral stage of development.</p></li>
<li><p class="">This stage begins at birth. During the oral stage, the mouth the primary focuses of energy.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Nursing infants derive pleasure from sucking and accepting things into the mouth. Should difficulties occur at this stage, such as problems with nursing, the adult may develop an oral character?</p></li>
<li><p class="">The oral stage culminates in the primary conflict of weaning, which concludes the sensory pleasure of nursing. This stage lasts approximately one and one-half years.</p></li>

<li><p class="">According to Freud, the child becomes preoccupied with the erogenous zone of the anus and with the retention or expulsion of the feces.</p></li>
<li><p class="">There is a conflict between the id-driven compulsion and pleasure connected with the expulsion of bodily wastes, and the ego and superego, which represent parental and societal pressures to control bodily functions.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Struggles around toileting may result in an anal fixation, leading to anal character traits. This stage lasts from one and one-half to two years.<a name="page532"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">532</span></span></p></li>

</div>
<div class="section" id="ch13lev2sec8"><h2 class="title">Sexuality in Early Childhood (Ages 3 to 7)</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">The early childhood years are marked by an increased interest in the environment as well as an increase in sexual exploration.</p></li>
<li><p class="">As children become more social beings, their sexual interactions expand from self-focused activities, such as genital stimulation and masturbation, to other-focused activities.</p></li>
<li><p class="">By interacting socially, children begin to what is socially acceptable and to learn privacy boundaries.</p></li>
<li><p class="">For example, although the incidence of masturbation continues in frequency, children begin to learn that that masturbation is something that is done in private.</p></li>
<li><p class="">This stage also marks the beginnings of both heterosexual and homosexual behavior. They may also have increased need for privacy while bathing and dressing.</p></li>
<li><p class="">During this timeframe, and most specifically around the ages of 4 to 5, children's sexuality becomes social.</p>
<p class="indent">This is most frequently exhibited in play, with children holding hands and kissing, likely imitating the adults around them or media they are exposed to.</p></li>
<li><p class="">In early childhood, children become more curious and they explore other children and adults’ bodies because of their curiosity.</p></li>
<li><p class="">At this age children have increased interest in the differences between adult and children's bodies. Pretending to be mommy or daddy and “playing doctor” and become more common activities.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The latter can be a somewhat controversial sexual milestone. “Playing doctor” generally involves children examining one another's genitals or engaging in fondling or touching.</p></li>
<li><p class="">This behavior is considered normative if children are willing participants and are close in age, although it can be uncomfortable for some parents, who see it as a prelude to more adult sexuality.</p></li>
<li><p class="">By about age 5, most children have formed a concept of what marriage is. This comes from direct observation in their own households as well as the influence of media. The concept of marriage is specifically a platonic one at this age. Children also seem to understand the idea that people marry those of another gender, and “playing house” is common.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent"><bold>Homosexual Behavior:</bold> During later childhood, sexual play may involve members of the same gender. This generally involves touching or fondling. Such play is normative and does not appear to mediate the development of adult sexuality.</p>
<p class="noindent"><bold>Freud's Phallic Stage of Development:</bold> The phallic stage (ages 3–6) of development is probably the most well-known of Freud's stages due to his theory of the Oedipus/Electra complex. In this stage, the child's erogenous zone is the genital region. It is within the context of the child's natural curiosity about his and other people's genitals that the essential conflict-the Oedipus complex-arises. The Oedipus complex involves the child's unconscious desire to possess the opposite-sexed parent and to eliminate the same-sexed one.</p>
<p class="noindent">According to Freudian theory, the child's identification with the same-sex parent is the successful resolution of the Oedipus complex and of the Electra complex. This is also a key psychological experience in developing a mature sexual role and identity. Freud thought that fixation at the phallic stage causes a person to be afraid or incapable of close love or a cause of homosexuality. <bold><a href="#ch13fig4" class="ulink-inter">Figure 13.4</a></bold> shows the milestones in sexual development.</p>

<div class="section" id="ch13lev2sec9"><h2 class="title">Sexuality in Preadolescence (Ages 8 to 12)</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">The ages of 8 to 12 reflect a transition from childhood to adolescence. For most children, it is during this timeframe that puberty occurs. While once thought to be a stage of latency in which sexual drive is dormant.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Freud saw latency as a period of repression of sexual desires and erogenous impulses.</p></li>
<li><p class="">According to the psychosexual theory, children transfer this repressed libidal energy into asexual pursuits such as school, athletics, and same-sex friendships.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Freud thought that it was only with the onset of puberty that sexuality reawakens and the genitals once again become a central focus of libidal energy</p></li>
<li><p class="">Although many parents would like to believe that preadolescence is a latency period, this does not actually seem to be the case. Children's interest in sexuality appears to remain active during this time.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent"><bold>Puberty and Pre-puberty:</bold> Puberty is the physical process of sexual maturation. The term puberty is derived from the Latin word puberatum (age of maturity) and refers to the bodily changes of sexuality. In girls, puberty usually begins at 11 years of age, but may start as early as age 7. A recent study published in Pediatrics found that by age 7, about 10% of white and 23% of African-American girls had started developing breasts.</p>
<p class="indent">Research continues to confirm that the preadolescent years are not ones in which most children actually engage in sexual behaviors. Because children are socializing primarily with others of the same sex, sexual exploration with same sex peers is normative. These activities involve masturbation, exhibitionism and fondling of one another's genitals.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch13lev2sec10"><h2 class="title">Sexuality in Adolescence (Ages 13 to 19)</h2>
<p class="noindent">Of all the developmental timeframes discussed so far, adolescence is indisputably the time in which sexual maturation, interest and experience surge. This increased interest is caused by continued focus and awareness of body changes and rising hormone levels. There is also the cultural expectation that teens begin to prepare for more adult roles through dating and some degree of more intimate contact, which may or may not be sexual intercourse. For both young men and young women testosterone level seems to have an affect on sexual activity. For young men this relationship is very strong. For young women it appears that testosterone levels, rather than levels of estrogen or progesterone levels, was related to sexuality. For girls, pubertal development also had an effect on sexuality.</p>
<p class="noindent"><bold>Freud's Genital Stage of Development</bold> (puberty onwards): In the genital stage libidinal energy once again focuses on the genitals and interest turns to relationships, specifically to romantic and sexual relationships with peers. This stage spans both adolescent and adult years.</p>

</div><div class="section" id="ch13lev1sec6"><h1 class="title">CIRCLES OF SEXUALITY MODEL (<a href="#ch13fig5" class="ulink-inter">FIG. 13.5</a>)</h1>
<p class="noindent">A useful model for understanding the various components of sexuality is the circles of sexuality model developed by Dennis Dailey. This model depicts sexuality as having 5 main components: sexualization, identity, health and reproduction, intimacy, and sensuality. Each component consists of several subtopics related to its characteristics and influences on human sexuality. One component of the model is equalization, which is the use of the body to influence, control, and manipulates others.<a name="page535"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">535</span></span></p>
<div class="section" id="ch13lev2sec11"><h2 class="title">Sexualization</h2>
<p class="noindent">Sexualization includes sexual teasing, flirting, seduction, sexual harassment, rape, and sexual misuse.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch13lev2sec12"><h2 class="title">Sexual Identity</h2>
<p class="noindent">Another component of the model is sexual identity. As defined by Dailey, sexual identity is one's sense of self as a sexual being and how one may live or is identified. This component of the model includes gender identity, sexual orientation, and gender roles.</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">A third component of the model is health and sexual reproduction, which is often the foundation of sexuality education. The circles of sexuality model expand beyond the basic understanding of sexuality for procreation and include contraception, fertility management, infertility, abortion, menopause, and sexually transmitted diseases.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch13lev2sec14"><h2 class="title">Intimacy</h2>
<p class="noindent">The fourth component of the circles of sexuality model is intimacy, which Dailey describes as the need and ability to experience emotional closeness to another human being and to have this closeness reciprocated.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch13lev2sec15"><h2 class="title">Sensuality</h2>
<p class="noindent">Finally, this model includes sensuality, which is the need and ability to accept one's body as an erotic possibility and sexual entity. The components of sensuality include body image, anatomy, skin hunger, the sexual response cycle, and attraction.</p>
<p class="indent">The circles of sexuality model are a fairly encompassing model, but discussions of female sexuality should also consider culture, values, beliefs, and historical social constructs. Despite the existence of many positive constructs of healthy sexuality, many teachings and experiences.</p>

<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">They understand that sexuality is a natural part of someone's life, and sexuality involves more than just sexual behavior.</p></li>
<li><p class="">A person who is sexually healthy can recognize that everyone has sexual rights.</p></li>

<p class="indent">These are worthy goals to set and obtain for people who want to make sexual health a priority in their lives. Not everyone will be able to check off each item from the list, and that's not necessarily an indicator that a person is lacking in sexual health or is otherwise unhealthy. Each person has different ideas and standards for sexual health, and it is an incredibly personal part of a person's identity and behavior. But generally, safety, both physical and emotional, and happiness for everyone in a sexual relationship are the keys to living a sexually healthy, authentic life.</p>
</div><div class="section" id="ch13lev1sec10"><h1 class="title">IMPORTANCE OF SEXUAL HEALTH</h1>
<p class="noindent">There are several paths to becoming sexually healthy, and they include education, safety, and also communication with healthcare providers and intimate partners <bold>(<a href="#ch13fig8" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 13.8</a>)</bold>.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Adequate and appropriate knowledge is essential for healthy practices in sexuality.</p></li>
<li><p class="">It helps to adopt and modify suitable behavior with reference to biological sex, gender identity and gender behavior.</p></li>
<li><p class="">It helps to understand and get conscious about one's own sexual feeling and qualities.</p></li>
<li><p class="">It helps to keep the health in comfortable attitude toward different types of sexual behavior.</p></li>
<li><p class="">It helps to develop effective interpersonal relations with both sexes.</p></li>
<li><p class="">It protects and prevents the occurrence of sexually transmitted diseases.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">Sexual health is important because it enables people to take charge of their reproductive health, and their emotional well-being surrounding their intimate relationships.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch13lev2sec23"><h2 class="title">Education</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">They will learn about the risks of unintended pregnancy and unprotected sex, and how to prevent STIs and unwanted pregnancy.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Most likely, they will also learn about sexual abuse, and consensually versus non-consensual sexual acts.</p></li>
<li><p class="">It is crucial that people continue to learn about sex and sexuality as they age so that they can make informed, healthy decisions about romantic relationships and their reproductive health.</p></li>

</div>
<div class="section" id="ch13lev2sec24"><h2 class="title">Sexual Safety</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Safety can refer to preventing pregnancy and STIs. It can also refer to staying safe from sexual abuse, assault, rape, or sexual exploitation.<a name="page538"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">538</span></span></p></li>
<li><p class="">While many birth control methods are incredibly effective at preventing unintended pregnancy, most forms of birth control do not prevent against the spread of STIs.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Over half of all adults will contract an STI at some point in their lives. STIs can be spread through vaginal, anal, and oral sex.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Unfortunately, some STIs do not even cause any symptoms. It is possible to spread an asymptomatic STI to an unsuspecting partner if a person does not use an effective barrier method during sex.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Latex condoms and abstinence are the only effective methods for preventing the spread of STIs during sexual activity.</p></li>
<li><p class="">It is important to use barrier methods and get regularly tested for STIs if someone is sexually active. Untreated STIs can cause pain, infertility, and they can even kill.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Women who are sexually active may want to consider a hormonal birth control method in addition to condoms to prevent unintended pregnancy.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Birth control pills, patches, shots, implants, and rings are incredibly effective at preventing pregnancy, and they also offer numerous health benefits as well.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch13lev2sec25"><h2 class="title">Communication</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Communication is a significant part of sexual health. When a person becomes sexually active, it is vital that they communicate with their doctors and healthcare team.</p></li>
<li><p class="">A doctor can inform of their risks, what types of safety measures to take, and how to prevent sexual health risks.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Supportive, knowledgeable healthcare officials can also answer questions relating to sexual health, and prescribe birth control if it fits a person's lifestyle and is safe to take.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Sometimes, people may have a sexual restriction or a sexual health issue. An informed doctor can prescribe medications to help with any problem that may limit a person's sexual functioning and lower their quality of life.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Relationships thrive when both partners are respectful, and communicate their needs, expectations, and their boundaries <bold>(<a href="#ch13fig9" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 13.9</a>)</bold>.</p></li>
<li><p class="">A sexually healthy person is someone that is respectful of their partner's boundaries.</p></li>
<li><p class="">It is vital for their sexual health to be in a relationship with someone who does not pressure them into doing something that makes them uncomfortable.</p></li>
<li><p class="">For healthy sexual relationships, both partners need to have open lines of communication about pregnancy, and safe sex practices.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Sexually healthy people will tell their partners if they have been diagnosed with an STI so that their partners can get tested and receive treatment.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Being in good sexual health means that someone is informed, respectful to themselves and others, and practices safe sex.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Sexual health also means that someone can enjoy a sexual relationship.</p></li>

</div><div class="section" id="ch13lev1sec11"><h1 class="title">SEXUAL ORIENTATION</h1>
<p class="noindent">During the teen years, the hormonal and physical changes of puberty usually mean people start noticing an increase in sexual feelings. It is common to wonder and sometimes worry about new sexual feelings. It takes time for many people to understand who they are and who they're becoming. Part of that involves better understanding of their own sexual feelings and who they are attracted to.</p>
<p class="noindent"><bold>Sexual orientation:</bold> Sexual orientation is the emotional, romantic, or sexual attraction that a person feels toward another person. There are several types of sexual orientation;</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Heterosexual:</bold> People who are heterosexual are romantically and physically attracted to members of the opposite sex: Heterosexual males are attracted to females, and heterosexual females are attracted to males. Heterosexuals are sometimes called “straight.”</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Homosexual:</bold> People who are homosexual are romantically and physically attracted to people of the same sex: Females who are attracted to other females are lesbian; males who are attracted to other males are often known as gay. (The term gay is sometimes used to describe homosexual individuals of either sex.)</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Bisexual:</bold> People who are bisexual are romantically and physically attracted to members of both sexes.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Asexual:</bold> People who are asexual may not be interested in sex, but they still feel emotionally close to other people.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">Sexual orientation is about whom you are attracted to and who you feel drawn to romantically, emotionally, and sexually. It is different than gender identity. Gender identity is not about who you are attracted to, but about whom you are—male, female, gender queer, etc. This means that being transgender (feeling like your assigned sex is very different from the gender you identify with) is not the same thing as being gay, lesbian, or bisexual. Sexual orientation is about who you want to be with. Gender identity is about who you are.<a name="page539"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">539</span></span></p>
<p class="noindent"><bold>There are a bunch of identities associated with sexual orientation:</bold></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">People who're attracted to a different gender (for example, women who are attracted to men or men who are attracted to women) often call themselves straight or heterosexual.</p></li>
<li><p class="">People who're attracted to people of the same gender often call themselves gay or homosexual. Gay women may prefer the term lesbian.</p></li>
<li><p class="">People who're attracted to both men and women often call themselves bisexual.</p></li>
<li><p class="">People whose attractions span across many different gender identities (male, female, transgender, gender queer, intersex, etc.) may call themselves pansexual or queer.</p></li>
<li><p class="">People who're unsure about their sexual orientation may call themselves questioning or curious.</p></li>
<li><p class="">People who do not experience any sexual attraction for anyone often call themselves asexual.</p></li>
</ul>
</div><div class="section" id="ch13lev1sec12"><h1 class="title">CONSEQUENCES OF POOR SEXUAL HEALTH</h1>
<p class="noindent">Poor sexual health can lead to a host of adverse consequences. Coercion, and also a lack of education or sexual health resources can lead to unintended pregnancy and STIs. Failing to communicate with doctors can also cause long-term physical health consequences. An unknown, untreated STI can cause the disease to spread, and even cause permanent health issues in the patient. Being unable to communicate in sexual and romantic relationships can cause emotional pain and distress, and severely impact the quality of someone's life.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch13lev2sec26"><h2 class="title">Sexual Health Problems</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Sexual health problems are the result of conditions, either in an individual, a relationship or a society, that require specific action for their identification, prevention and treatment.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The expert working group of PAHO/WHO proposed a syndromic approach to classification that makes problems easier to identify by both health workers and the general public, and easier to report for epidemiological considerations.</p></li>
<li><p class="">All of these sexual health problems can be identified by primary health workers. Someone can be addressed by trained health workers at a primary level, but for others referral to a specialist is necessary.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Clinical syndromes that impair sexual functioning (sexual dysfunction) such as sexual aversion, dysfunctional sexual arousal and vaginismus in females, and erectile dysfunction and premature ejaculation in males.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Clinical syndromes related to impairment of emotional attachment or love (paraphilias) such as exhibitionism, pedophilia, sadism and voyeurism.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Clinical syndromes related to compulsive sexual behavior such as compulsive sexual behavior in a relationship.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Clinical syndromes involving gender identity conflict such as adolescent gender dysphoria.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Clinical syndromes related to violence and victimization such as clinical syndromes after being sexually abused as a child (including post-traumatic stress disorder); clinical syndromes after being sexually harassed; clinical syndromes after being violated or raped; clinical phobia focused on sexuality; patterns of unsafe sexual behavior placing self and/or others at risk for HIV infection and/or other STIs.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Clinical syndromes related to reproduction such as sterility, infertility, unwanted pregnancy, abortion complications.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Clinical syndromes related to sexually transmitted infections such as genital ulcers, urethral, vaginal or rectal discharge, lower abdominal pain in women, asymptomatic STIs.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Clinical syndromes related to other conditions such as clinical syndromes secondary to disability or infirmity, secondary to mental or physical illness, secondary to medication.</p></li>

<li><p class="">Education and communication are the keys to leading a sexual health life. There are many self-help books and resources available, and it is important to speak to a romantic partner about boundaries and needs.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Sometimes, it can be difficult to speak about sensitive subjects to a sexual partner. Shame and negative social conditioning can cause people to ignore their needs or the needs of their partner. In some cases, it can be beneficial to speak to a therapist or counselor who is knowledgeable and supportive of sexual health.<a name="page540"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">540</span></span></p></li>
<li><p class="">Talk therapy or one-on-one therapy, and even couples counseling can help people wade through these issues and come out the other side in better sexual health. Therapy can give people the tools they need to communicate their boundaries and expectations respectfully, and in a safe, judgment-free environment.</p></li>
<li><p class="">It is also important to speak to a doctor about sexual health needs. Many different organizations are primarily geared toward serving the patient's sexual needs. These organizations can help someone choose the right type of birth control for their lifestyle, and also offer STI and pregnancy testing.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Sexual health is an integral part of living an authentic life. Making sexual health a priority can significantly improve a person's emotional, physical, and mental well-being, as well as enhance their intimate relationships and quality of life.</p></li>

<p class="noindent">The sexual response cycle is the physiologic manifestation of the interplay of sexual interest, culture and psychology. it can be initiated by an individual alone as in masturbation or through a relationship with another person <bold>(<a href="#ch13fig10" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 13.10</a>)</bold>.</p>

<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">In the circulatory system, vasocongestion, or blood pooling, increase the size of many parts of the body. Vasocongestion occurs in the erectile tissue, where the blood fills specially constructed spaces in the nipples, clitoris, and penis.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The shaft of the penis is made up of spaces and cavities like sponge.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The blood vessels leading to the tissues dilate, permitting an increased inflow of blood, thereby filling the spaces in the erectile tissue with blood.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Another type of vasocongestion occurs when existing blood vessels engorge with blood these results in increased size of breasts and labia.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Vaginal lubrication occurs because there is increased pressure in the vaginal capillaries therefore its size is increased which leads to high flow of fluid in the vagina.</p></li>

The above depict the physiologic sexual responses of both male and female according to <bold>masters</bold> and Johnson's phases in the sexual response cycle who has explained clearly about these phases. Subjectively the orgasmic phase is the peak pleasurable experience in both the sexes. Woman has the potential for multiple orgasms and may experience the second third orgasm as the most pleasurable. In man, the orgasm with the largest ejaculate is experienced as the most pleasurable and this is the first orgasm. The orgasms in woman have been described as twice as long as the men's and with greater intensity. Individual variations, of course, do result in difference from these generalizations. The vasocongestion in female is generalized to the entire pelvic area, in contrast to the male's more localized congestion, total volume of the blood is removed by muscle contraction, is greater in female.<a name="page542"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">542</span></span> Another unique feature of the female sexual response is that the uterine contractions in the woman during orgasm show the same-recorded pattern as the first stage of labor, but they differ in amplitude. The sexual arousal in woman occurs more readily during the Luteal phase or the last 14 days of the menstrual cycle. This result in increased pelvic congestion, increased vaginal fluid, and subsequent increased ‘interest’.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">According to interpreted sexual functioning as an interaction between the biophysical and psychosocial system. These systems could rein force or inhibit each other. In an individual who has acquired positive attitudes and values about the gender, sex role, and the characteristics of masculinity and femininity and has the positive image as a sexual being, the biologic and sexual response cycle will be enhanced.</p>
<p class="indent">Certain cultural characteristics of femininity and masculinity may inhibit or enhance the biophysical response cycle. Feminine characteristic of affection and affiliation may enhance the sexual relationship, whereas passivity and submissiveness may contribute to denial and suppression of individual sex needs. Similarly, a masculine identity of assertiveness and activity may contribute to healthy acknowledgement and pursuit of a sexual relationship, but competitiveness and independence may inhibit underlying sexual relationship.</p>

<div class="section" id="ch13lev2sec38"><h2 class="title">Types of Paraphilias</h2>
<p class="noindent">The term “paraphilia” is used to identify repetitive or preferred sexual fantasies or behaviors; types of paraphilias include the following:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Exhibitionism:</bold> The major symptoms include recurrent, intense sexual urges, behaviors, or sexually arousing fantasies, of at least 6 months duration, involving the exposure of one's genitals to an unsuspecting stranger.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Fetishism:</bold> In DSM-5, fetishism involves recurrent, intense sexual fantasies, of at least 6 months duration, involving the use of nonliving objects (such as undergarments or high-heeled shoes) or a highly specific focus on a body part (most often nongenital, such as feet) to attain sexual arousal.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Frotteurism:</bold> This disorder is defined in DSM-5 as the recurrent preoccupation with intense sexual urges or fantasies, of at least 6 months duration, involving touching or rubbing against a nonconsenting person and the individual has acted on these sexual urges with a nonconsenting person, or the sexual urges or fantasies cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Pedophilia:</bold> The DSM-IV-TR describes the essential feature of pedophilia as recurrent, sexual urges, behaviors, or sexually arousing fantasies, of at least 6 months duration, involving sexual activity with a prepubescent child; the age of the molester is 16 or older and is at least 5 years older than the child. Pedophilia is termed pedophilic disorder in DSM-5 and the manual specifies it as a paraphilia involving strong and habitual sexual urges towards and fantasies about prepubescent children that have either been acted upon or which cause the person with the attraction distress or interpersonal difficulty.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Sexual masochism:</bold> The identifying behavior of this disorder is recurrent, intense sexual urges, behaviors, or sexually arousing fantasies, of at least 6 months duration, involving the act of being humiliated, beaten, bound, or otherwise made to suffer. DSM-5 indicates that a person may have a masochistic sexual interest but that the diagnosis of sexual masochism disorder would only pertain to individuals who also report psychosocial distress because of it.<a name="page543"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">543</span></span></p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Sexual sadism:</bold> The essential feature of sexual sadism is identified as recurrent, intense sexual urges, behaviors, or sexually arousing fantasies, of at least 6 months duration, involving acts in which the psychological or physical suffering (including humiliation) of the victim is sexually exciting.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Voyeurism:</bold> This disorder is identified as recurrent, intense, sexual urges, behaviors, or sexually arousing fantasies, of at least 6 months duration, involving the act of observing an unsuspecting person who is naked, in the process of disrobing, or engaging in sexual activity.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch13lev2sec39"><h2 class="title">Types of Sexual Dysfunctions</h2>
<p class="noindent">Sexual dysfunctions may occur in any phase of the sexual response cycle; types of sexual dysfunctions include the following:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Hypoactive sexual disorder:</bold> This disorder is defined by the DSM-5 as persistent or recurrently deficient sexual or erotic thoughts, fantasies, and desire for sexual activity.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Sexual aversion disorder.</bold> This disorder is characterized by a persistent or recurrent extreme aversion to, and avoidance of, all (or almost all) genital sexual contact with a sexual partner. In the development from DSM-IV-TR to DSM-5, the diagnosis of sexual aversion disorder (SAD) has been removed.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Female sexual arousal disorder:</bold> This disorder is identified in the DSM-IV-TR as a persistent or recurrent inability to attain, or to maintain until completion of the sexual activity, an adequate lubrication or swelling response of sexual excitement. It is defined in the DSM-5 as lack of, or significantly reduced, sexual interest/arousal. <bold><a href="#ch13fig12" class="ulink-inter">Figure 13.12</a></bold> shows the causes of female sexual dysfunction.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Male erectile disorder:</bold> This disorder is defined in the DSM-5 as the recurrent inability to achieve an erection, the inability to maintain an adequate erection, and/or a noticeable decrease in erectile rigidity during partnered sexual activity.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Female orgasmic disorder (anorgasmia):</bold> This disorder is defined by the DSM-IV-TR as a persistent or recurrent delay in, or absence of, orgasm following a normal sexual excitement phase. As classified by the DSM-5, female orgasmic disorder is characterized by difficulty experiencing orgasm and/or markedly reduced intensity of orgasmic sensations.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Male orgasmic disorder (retarded ejaculation):</bold> With this disorder, the man is unable to ejaculate, even though he has a firm erection and has had more than adequate stimulation. This disorder is also known as delayed ejaculation (DE) or delayed orgasm (DO). DE is defined in DSM-5 as a persistent difficulty or inability to achieve orgasm despite the presence of adequate desire, arousal, and stimulation.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Premature ejaculation:</bold> The DSM-IV-TR describes this disorder as persistent or recurrent ejaculation with minimal sexual stimulation before, on, or shortly after penetration and before the person wishes it. In DSM-5, premature ejaculation is defined as a persistent or recurrent pattern of ejaculation occurring during partnered sexual activity within about one minute following vaginal penetration and before the individual wishes it.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Dyspareunia:</bold> Dyspareunia is defined as recurrent or persistent genital pain associated with sexual intercourse, in either a man or a woman that is not caused by vaginismus lack of lubrication, another general medical condition, or the physiological effects of substance use.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Vaginismus:</bold> Vaginismus is characterized by an involuntary constriction of the outer third of the vagina, which prevents penile insertion and intercourse. In DSM-5, the spasm-based definition of vaginismus was omitted, and vaginismus was combined with dyspareunia, the other “sexual pain disorder,” which resulted in genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder (GPPPD).</p></li>

<p class="noindent">Predisposing factors to paraphilias include:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Biological factors:</bold> Various studies have implicated several organic factors in the etiology of paraphilias; destruction of parts of the limbic system in animals has been shown to cause hypersexual behavior (Becker and Johnson, 2008); temporal lobe diseases, such as psychomotor seizures or temporal lobe tumors, have been implicated in some individuals with paraphilias; abnormal levels of androgens also may contribute to inappropriate sexual arousal.<a name="page544"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">544</span></span></p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Psychoanalytic theory:</bold> The psychoanalytic approach defines a paraphiliac as one who has failed the normal developmental process toward heterosexual adjustment.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent"><bold>Predisposing factors to sexual dysfunction include:</bold></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Sexual desire disorders:</bold> In men, these disorders have been linked to low levels of serum testosterone and to elevated levels of serum prolactin; evidence also exists that suggests a relationship between serum testosterone and increased female libido; various medications, such as antihypertensives, antipsychotics, antidepressants, anxiolytics, and anticonvulsants, as well as chronic use of drugs such as alcohol and cocaine, have also been implicated in sexual desire disorders.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Sexual arousal disorders:</bold> These may occur in response to decreased estrogen levels in postmenopausal women; medications such as antihistamines and cholinergic blockers may produce similar results; erectile dysfunctions in men may be attributed to arteriosclerosis, diabetes, temporal lobe epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, some medications (antihypertensives, antidepressants and tranquilizers), spinal cord injury, pelvic surgery, and chronic use of alcohol.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Orgasmic disorders:</bold> In women these may be attributed to some medical conditions (hypothyroidism, diabetes, and depression) and certain medications (antihypertensives, antidepressants); medical conditions that may interfere with male orgasm include genitourinary surgery (e.g., prostatectomy), Parkinson's disease, and diabetes.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Sexual pain disorders:</bold> In women these can be caused by disorders of the vaginal entrance, irritation or damage to the clitoris, vaginal or pelvic infections, endometriosis, tumors, or cysts. Painful intercourse in men may be attributed to penile infections, phimosis, urinary tract infections, or prostate problems.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="section" id="ch13lev2sec42"><h2 class="title">Medical Management</h2>
<p class="noindent">Modalities that may be considered in the treatment of gender dysphoria include pharmacologic therapy, psychological and other nonpharmacologic therapies, and sexual reassignment surgery (SRS).</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Psychological and speech therapy:</bold> Psychological intervention may be beneficial; individual treatment focuses on understanding and dealing with gender issues; group, marital, and family therapy can provide a helpful and supportive environment; speech therapy may help male-to-female individuals use their voice in a more feminine manner.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Sexual reassignment surgery:</bold> Controversy exists regarding whether adolescents should be allowed to pursue SRS; many countries deny SRS to adolescents; however, early treatment may be beneficial in adolescents whose secondary sex characteristics (e.g., facial hair, lowered voice, and breast development) have not yet developed fully. In such cases, parental involvement and approval are essential.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch13lev2sec43"><h2 class="title">Pharmacologic Management</h2>
<p class="noindent">The goal of pharmacotherapy is to inhibit or promote the expression of secondary sex characteristics in males and females.</p>

<li><p class=""><bold>Determine stressors:</bold> Help client determine time dimension associated with the onset of the problem and discuss what was happening in his or her life situation at that time.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Encourage discussion of disease process:</bold> Encourage client to discuss disease process that may be contributing to sexual dysfunction; ensure that client is aware that alternative methods of achieving sexual satisfaction exist and can be learned through sex counseling if he or she and partner desire to do so.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Identify factors that affect client's sexuality:</bold> Note cultural, social, ethnic, racial, and religious factors that may contribute to conflicts regarding variant sexual practices.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Be accepting and nonjudgmental:</bold> Sexuality is a very personal and sensitive subject; the client is more likely to share this information if he or she does not fear being judged by the nurse.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Provide positive reinforcement:</bold> Observe client behaviors and the responses he or she elicits from others; give social attention (e.g., smile, nod) to desired behaviors.</p></li>

<p class="noindent">Taking a sexual history is a skill that the nurse should develop with experience:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Develop a warm, open, trusting relationship with the client.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The problems that have been shared by the clients to the nurse should be valued and treated as confidential.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The individuals need for self-worth must be respected.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The nurse needs to collect a thorough sexual history if a sexual problem is suspected or identified.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Once the sexual problem is revealed by the nurse from the client, nurse needs to help the client to solve the problem.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The nurse can do a proper referral to the client after collecting the complete information.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Effective communication skill, adequate knowledge about his or her own self on the healthy sexual continuum are needed for the nurse to establish a trusting relationship with the clients.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">The main important points to be remembered before taking a sexual history include the following:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Assume everyone does everything.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Give positive feedback to the individual.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Follow the lead of the client, i.e., listen carefully to the clients’ messages about what concerns her or him.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Avoid using ambiguous expressions like “making love” for vaginal intercourse and be familiar with and use when appropriate the special vocabularies of cultural or economic groups like “prick” (for penis) or “cunt” (vagina).</p></li>
<li><p class="">Be aware of particular sexual customs and norms that predominate in specific groups.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Use eye-to-eye contact</p></li>
<li><p class="">Validate the client's responses by clarifying and restating the question or response.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Avoid statements like “everyone does that”.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent"><bold>The important sexual history components, which must be collected and documented general, physical, developmental and lifestyle factors:</bold></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Ask for any past history of systemic illness, e.g., diabetes, history of STD, e.g., vaginitis, syphilis</p></li>
<li><p class="">Collect the history of progression of physical sexual maturity, onset of menarche, regularity of the menses, any menstrual problems in female, age of first ejaculation of semen, any history of masturbation.</p></li>

</ul>
<p class="noindent"><bold>Psychosocial factors the nurse should ask for the following:</bold></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Progression through and accomplishment of age-appropriate psychosocial tasks.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Body image, satisfaction with the physical appearance.</p></li>

<p class="noindent"><bold>Infection of the reproductive system may be classified as:</bold></p>
<p class="noindent">Non-specific usually caused by a mixture of microbes, e.g., staphylococci, streptococci, coliform bacteria, <span class="italic">Clostridium perfringens</span>. Specific, caused by sexually transmitted microbes, the most common of which being <span class="italic">Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Trichomonas vaginalis, Chlamydia</span>, herpes viruses, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis B. Microbes that cause sexually transmitted infections are unable to survive outside the body for long periods and have no intermediate host.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p class=""><bold>Chlamydia:</bold> The microbe <span class="italic">Chlamydia trachomatis</span> causes inflammation of the female cervix. Infection may ascend through the reproductive tract and cause pelvic inflammatory disease. In the male, it may cause urethritis, which may also ascend and lead to epididymitis. Chlamydia infection is often present in conjunction with other sexually transmitted diseases. The same organism causes trachoma, an eye infection that is the primary cause of blindness worldwide.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Gonorrhea:</bold> This is caused by <span class="italic">Neisseria gonorrhoeae</span>, which affects the mucosa of the reproductive and urinary tracts. In the male, suppurative urethritis occurs and the infection may spread to the prostate gland, epididymis and testes. In the female the infection may spread from vulvar glands, vagina and cervix to the body of the uterus, uterine tubes, ovaries and peritoneum. Healing by fibrosis in the female may cause obstruction of the uterine tubes, leading to infertility. In the male, it may cause urethral stricture. Non-venereal transmission of gonorrhea may cause neonatal ophthalmia in babies born to infected mothers. The eyes are infected as the baby passes through the vagina.<a name="page547"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">547</span></span></p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Syphilis:</bold> This disease is caused by <span class="italic">Treponema pallidum</span>. There are three clearly marked stages although the third is now rarely seen in Britain. After an incubation period of several weeks, the primary sore (chancre) appears at the site of infection, e.g., the vulva, vagina, perineum, penis or round the mouth.</p>
<p class="indent">In the female the primary sore may be undetected if it is internal. After several weeks the chancre subsides spontaneously. Secondary lesions appear 3 to 4 months after infection. They consist of skin rashes and raised papules (condylomata lata) on the external genitalia and vaginal walls. These subside after several months and are followed by a latent period of a variable number of years. Tertiary lesions (gummas) then develop in many organs, and may involve the nervous system, leading to general paralysis.</p>
<p class="indent">Sexual transmission occurs during the primary and secondary stages when discharge from lesions contains microbes. Congenital transmission occurs when microbes from an infected mother cross the placenta to the fetus, often with fatal consequences. Accidental spread of infection may occur by blood transfusion if a donor's blood is taken during the incubation period after microbes have spread to the blood from the site of infection.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Trichomonas vaginalis:</bold> These protozoa cause acute vulvovaginitis. It is usually sexually transmitted and is commonly present in women with gonorrhea.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Candidiasis:</bold> The yeast <span class="italic">Candida albicans</span> is frequently a commensal in the normal vagina and causes no problems. It is normally prevented from flourishing by vaginal acidity, but in certain circumstances it proliferates, causing candidiasis (thrush). Common precipitating factors include:
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p class="">Antibiotic therapy, which kills the bacteria that keep vaginal pH low</p></li>
</ol>
</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and hepatitis B infection:</bold> These viral conditions may be sexually transmitted, but there are no local signs of infection.</p></li>

<div class="section" id="ch13lev2sec51"><h2 class="title">Preventing Measure of STIs</h2>
<p class="noindent">There are several ways to avoid or reduce your risk of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) or sexually transmitted infections (STIs).</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Abstain:</bold> The most effective way to avoid STIs is to not have (abstain from) sex.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Stay with one uninfected partner:</bold> Another reliable way of avoiding STIs is to stay in a long-term mutually monogamous relationship in which both people have sex only with each other and neither partner is infected.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Wait and test:</bold> Avoid vaginal and anal intercourse with new partners until you have both been tested for STIs. Oral sex is less risky, but uses a latex condom or dental dam to prevent direct (skin-to-skin) contact between the oral and genital mucous membranes.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Get vaccinated:</bold> Getting vaccinated early, before sexual exposure, is also effective in preventing certain types of STIs. Vaccines are available to prevent human papillomavirus (HPV), hepatitis A and hepatitis B.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Use condoms and dental dams consistently and correctly:</bold> Use a new latex condom or dental dam for each sex act, whether oral, vaginal or anal. Never use an oil-based lubricant, such as petroleum jelly</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Do not drink alcohol or use drugs:</bold> If you are under the influence, you are more likely to take sexual risks.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Communicate:</bold> Before any serious sexual contact, communicate with your partner about practicing safer sex. Be sure you specifically agree on what activities will and won't be OK.</p>

<p class="noindent">Sexual abuse can lead to long-lasting, even life-long, consequences and is a serious problem on an individual, familial and societal level. Therefore, prevention measures on different levels are a public health issue. Minors as well as adults should be involved in prevention work in order to prevent sexual abuse of minors in a sustainable way.

<p class="noindent">Sexual healthcare is as important as the care of physical and mental health, yet many primary care nurses are ill prepared to address these needs. A fundamental factor is how you conduct the consultation as this can affect whether the patient takes on board any advice given, and whether they feel able to return for future discussions. The principles apply to all nursing consultations, but the following are particular areas to consider for a sexual health consultation <bold>(<a href="#ch13fig16" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 13.16</a>)</bold>:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Confidentiality and privacy:</bold> Even to those less than 16 years of age if they are competent according to Fraser guidelines and for each patient if a partner is a member of the same practice.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Non-verbal skills:</bold> Both yours and the patient's. Avoid appearing shocked or judgmental. Body language is imperative; ensure you appear welcoming. Have a relaxed seating position and let the patient see that you are listening by nodding your head and recapping.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Give a friendly, welcoming greeting:</bold> Introduce yourself and ask ‘how can I help?’. Advise the patient you may need to ask some very personal questions to assist you in the consultation, and ask if they agree to this.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Use demonstration models</bold> where necessary (e.g., when teaching correct use of condoms).</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Always be aware of potential safeguarding</bold> issues for all ages, particularly patients at risk, domestic violence, child sexual exploitation, patients with learning disabilities and mental capacity issues. Ensure you are aware of the local safeguarding policy and escalation and your surgery's reporting mechanism.</p></li>

<li><p class="">Date of last episode of sex - to identify incubation periods for infection. In the under 25s the most common STI is chlamydia which has a two-week incubation period.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Does she have a current partner? If yes, is it male or female? This will assist with risk assessment.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Apart from her current partner is she having sex with anyone else - again, this will assist with risk assessment.</p></li>
<li><p class="">How many sexual partners has she had in the past six months? For risk assessment.</p></li>
<li><p class="">History of previous STIs and participation in National Chlamydia Screening Programme - to assist with risk assessment</p></li>
<li><p class="">Co-morbidities including epilepsy, diabetes, whether she is immunocompromised - to explore non sexual reasons for discharge.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Current medication - to exclude drug interactions.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Exclude possibility of non-infective causes including retained tampons, condoms, foreign bodies, cervical ectopy, polyps or dermatological disease.</p></li>
<li><p class="">A comprehensive sexual health history was taken and provided the following information.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Patient was symptomatic for two weeks with a white-grey discharge. Only when asked about its odor did she confirm it had a ‘fishy smell’. She reported no other symptoms. When asked about hygiene and bathing she said she performed vaginal douching. This demonstrates how effective communication skills and appropriate questions will often provide further depth.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Her current contraception was a subdermal contraceptive implant inserted 10 months previously, and she reported no condom use.</p></li>
<li><p class="">She had amenorrhea—a common side-effect with this contraceptive method.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Her last episode of sex was two weeks ago with her current male partner. She has no other sexual partners. She has had this one sexual partner in the past six months.</p></li>
<li><p class="">She had no previous episodes of infection and no comorbidities or medication, and no reports of possibility of foreign objects.</p></li>

<p class="noindent">Inappropriate sexual behavior, or sexually aggressive behavior, is a term which encompasses a variety of behaviors, including obscene gesturing, touching or hugging another person, exposing body parts or disrobing, and masturbating in public. Inappropriate sexual behavior often elicits feelings of anxiety, embarrassment, or unease in the caregiver and the result is often disruption in continuity of care for the patient. The cause of inappropriate sexual behavior varies among individuals and careful assessment of the etiology of the behavior is the first essential step in intervening. Inappropriate sexual behaviors can include:<a name="page554"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">554</span></span></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p class="">Sexual conversation or content.</p></li>

<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Almost 90% of the nursing workforce is female—clients within sexual health services show a preference for care delivered by females. Nurse-led services can achieve clinical outcomes that are equally as effective as medical care.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Patient satisfaction with care delivered by nurses has been shown to be equal, or superior, to satisfaction with care delivered by doctors.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The availability of nurse prescribing enables nurses to deliver the full range of contraceptive care and to provide a range of treatments for sexually acquired infections.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Nursing emphasizes concordance as opposed to compliance; this increased patient involvement in decision-making helps to empower clients.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Nursing places strong emphasis on patient education and preventative health care (both of which are important features within sexual health care).</p></li>

<p class="noindent">Sexuality is inseparable from sexual health and can refer to sex, gender identities, orientation, pleasure, intimacy, expression, and reproduction. While each element of human sexuality is important, all of these components interconnect to make us complete sexual beings. Educators and other human service providers thus require professional preparation to ensure they can meet the needs of their learners, effectively manage programming, and successfully implement strategies that allow individuals to embrace or manage their sexual existence. An inclusive approach to sexual health is best to meet the sexual health needs of all women, while ensuring their agency and control of their own bodies.<a name="page556"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">556</span></span></p>
