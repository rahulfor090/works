</div><div class="section" id="ch8lev1sec2"><h1 class="title">REVIEW OF PHYSIOLOGICAL REGULATION OF FLUID, ELECTROLYTE, AND ACID-BASE BALANCES</h1>
<p class="noindent">Body fluids are contained in three compartments. Most of the fluids of the body are inside the cells called the intracellular compartment. The fluid outside the cell is called extracellular fluid. The extracellular fluid is divided into two parts. The fluid that is within the vessel is called intravascular fluid. The fluid between the cells is called interstitial fluid. The kidneys excrete the largest quantity of body fluid, but fluid leaves the body also via gastrointestinal tract (GIT), lungs, and skin. Two sources of body fluid are through ingestion and digestion of fat, carbohydrate, and protein. About 10 mL of water is released in the metabolism of 100 calories of fat, carbohydrate, or protein.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class=""><ul style="list-style-type: square">
<li><p class="">Fluid occupies almost 60% of the weight of an adult.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Body fluid is located in two fluid compartments: the intracellular space and the extracellular space.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Electrolytes in body fluids are active chemicals or cations that carry positive charges and anions that carry negative charges.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The major cations in the body fluid are sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and hydrogen ions.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The major anions are chloride, bicarbonate, sulfate, and proteinate ions.</p></li>
</ul></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch8lev2sec1"><h2 class="title">Electrolytes Description</h2>
<p class="noindent">Electrolytes are ionized molecules found throughout the blood, tissues, and cells of the body. These molecules, which are either positive (cations) or negative (anions), conduct an electric current and help to balance pH and acid–base levels in the body. Electrolytes also facilitate the passage of fluid between and within cells through a process known as osmosis and play a part in regulating the function of the neuromuscular, endocrine, and excretory systems.</p>
<p class="noindent"><bold>The serum electrolytes include:</bold></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Sodium (Na):</bold> A positively charged electrolyte that helps to balance fluid levels in the body and facilitates neuromuscular functioning.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Potassium (K):</bold> A main component of cellular fluid, this positive electrolyte helps to regulate neuromuscular function and osmotic pressure.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Calcium (Ca):</bold> A cation, or positive electrolyte that affects neuromuscular performance and contributes to skeletal growth and blood coagulation.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Magnesium (Mg):</bold> Influences muscle contractions and intracellular activity.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Chloride (CI):</bold> An anion, or negative electrolyte that regulates blood pressure.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Phosphate (HPO<sub>4</sub></bold><bold>):</bold> Negative electrolyte that impacts metabolism and regulates acid–base balance and calcium levels.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Bicarbonate (HCO<sub>3</sub></bold><bold>):</bold> A negatively charged electrolyte that assists in the regulation of blood pH levels. Bicarbonate insufficiencies and elevations cause acid–base disorders (i.e., acidosis, alkalosis).</p></li>
<li><p class="">Medications, chronic diseases, and trauma (for example, burns, or fractures, etc.) may cause the concentration of certain electrolytes in the body to become too high (hyper-) or too low (hypo-).</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch8lev2sec2"><h2 class="title">Homeostasis</h2>
<p class="noindent">Homeostasis is the dynamic process in which the body maintains balance by constantly adjusting to internal and external stimuli.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch8lev2sec3"><h2 class="title">Negative and Positive Feedback</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Feedback:</bold> The relaying of information about a given condition to the appropriate organ or system.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Negative feedback:</bold> Negative feedback occurs when the body <bold>reverses</bold> an original stimulus for the body to regain physiologic balance.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Positive feedback:</bold> Positive feedback <bold>enhances</bold> or intensifies the original stimulus.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Examples:</bold> Blood pressure control and maintenance of normal body temperature are examples of negative feedback while blood clotting after an injury and a woman in labor are examples of positive feedback.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch8lev2sec4"><h2 class="title">Systems Involved in Feedback</h2>
<p class="noindent">The major systems involved in feedback are the nervous and endocrine systems.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Nervous system:</bold> The nervous system regulates homeostasis by sensing system deviations and sending <bold>nerve impulses</bold> to appropriate organs.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Endocrine system:</bold> The endocrine system uses the release and action of <bold>hormones</bold> to maintain homeostasis.<a name="page326"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">326</span></span></p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch8lev2sec5"><h2 class="title">Acid-base Balance</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">An important property of blood is its degree of acidity or alkalinity. Body acidity increases when the level of acidic compounds in the body rises (through increased intake or production, or decreased elimination) or when the level of basic (alkaline) compounds in the body falls (through decreased intake or production, or increased elimination).</p></li>
<li><p class="">Body alkalinity increases with the reverse of these processes. The body's balance between acidity and alkalinity is referred to as acid–base balance.</p></li>
<li><p class="">One mechanism the body uses to control blood pH involves the release of carbon dioxide from the lungs.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Carbon dioxide, which is mildly acidic, is a waste product of the metabolism of oxygen (which all cells need) and, as such, is constantly produced by cells. As with all waste products, carbon dioxide gets excreted into the blood.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The blood carries carbon dioxide to the lungs, where it is exhaled. As carbon dioxide accumulates in the blood, the pH of the blood decreases.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The brain regulates the amount of carbon dioxide that is exhaled by controlling the speed and depth of breathing.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The amount of carbon dioxide exhaled, and consequently the pH of the blood, increases as breathing becomes faster and deeper. By adjusting the speed and depth of breathing, the brain and lungs are able to regulate the blood pH minute by minute.</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class=""><bold>Hyponatremia</bold> refers to a serum sodium level that is &lt;135 mEq/L.</p>
<p class=""><bold>Hypernatremia</bold> is a serum sodium level &gt;145 mEq/L.</p>
<p class=""><bold>Hypokalemia</bold> usually indicates a deficit in total potassium stores.</p>
<p class=""><bold>Hyperkalemia</bold> refers to a potassium level &gt;5.0 mEq/L.</p>
<p class=""><bold>Hypocalcemia</bold> are serum levels below 8.6 mg/dL.</p>
<p class=""><bold>Hypercalcemia</bold> is calcium level &gt;10.2 mg/dL.</p>
<p class=""><bold>Hypomagnesemia</bold> refers to a below-normal serum magnesium concentration.</p>
<p class=""><bold>Hypermagnesemia</bold> are serum levels over 2.3 mg/dL.</p>
<p class=""><bold>Hypophosphatemia</bold> is indicated by a value below 2.5 mg/dL.</p>
<p class=""><bold>Hyperphosphatemia</bold> is a serum phosphorus level that exceeds 4.5 mg/dL in adults.</p>

</div><div class="section" id="ch8lev1sec3"><h1 class="title">FLUID INTAKE</h1>
<p class="noindent">Under normal circumstances most of our fluid intake is oral, but remember that all food contains some water and electrolytes and also that water and CO<sub>2</sub> are end products of the oxidation of foodstuffs to produce energy. This metabolic water is a small but significant contribution to net intake.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Our drinking behavior is governed by the sensation of thirst, which is triggered whenever our water balance is negative through insufficient intake or increased loss.</p></li>
<li><p class="">It may also be triggered by a high salt intake, which necessitates the intake and retention of extra water in order to maintain the ECF sodium concentration and osmolality in the normal range.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Although, in the elderly, the thirst mechanism becomes blunted, it ensures, on the whole, that our intake matches the needs of bodily functions, maintaining a zero balance in which intake and output are equal and physiological osmolality (280–290 mOsm/kg) is maintained.</p></li>
<li><p class="">More than a century ago Claude Bernard coined the term ‘volume obligatoire’ to describe the minimum volume of urine needed to excrete waste products, e.g., urea, in order to prevent them accumulating in the blood.</p></li>
<li><p class="">This concept implies that, if sufficient fluid has been drunk or administered to balance insensible or other losses and to meet the kidney's needs, there is no advantage in giving additional or excessive volumes.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Indeed, excessive intakes of fluid and electrolytes may be hazardous under certain circumstances and overwhelm the kidney's capacity to excrete the excess and maintain normal balance.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Salt and water retention becomes clinically apparent in the form of edema when the ECF has been expanded by at least 2–3 liters.</p></li>

The minimum requirement for water is the amount that equals losses and prevents adverse effects of insufficient water, such as dehydration. There are numerous limitations associated with the requirement estimates used to make recommendations.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Water in food: 0.7 L</p></li>
<li><p class="">Metabolic water (which is produced in the body during biochemical reactions): 3 L</p></li>
<li><p class="">Drinking: 5 additional liters.<a name="page328"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">328</span></span></p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">Water is the preferred drink to hydrate the body. Water is an essential nutrient for healthy hydration without bringing any other elements into the body. An over-consumption of sugar sweetened beverages can lead to excessive calorie intake; substitution of sugary beverages by water is one of the healthy habits which help to fight against overweight/obesity risk.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch8lev2sec16"><h2 class="title">Water Requirements</h2>
<p class="noindent">Requirements of water vary with climate, dietary constituents, activities and surface area of the body. As a rule a person should take enough water to excrete about 1,200–1500 mL of urine per day. In tropics because of greater water loss through perspiration increased water intake is required to maintain urine volume. Normal intake of water ranges between 8–10 glasses per day. Approximate daily values of fluid input and output in health is shown in <bold><a href="#ch8fig1" class="ulink-inter">Figure 8.1</a></bold>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch8lev2sec17"><h2 class="title">Daily Water Input (<a href="#ch8fig2" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 8.2</a>)</h2>
<p class="noindent">In tropical countries like India the daily water input amounts to 2,400–3,000 mL of water through food, as fluid drinks and as metabolic water.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">As fluid drinks—water, tea, coffee, milk soups 1,500–1,750 mL</p></li>
<li><p class="">Water intake through solid food: 600–900 mL</p></li>
<li><p class="">Oxidation of carbohydrate, fat, 300–350 mL proteins (metabolic water)</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">Total 2,400–3,000 mL</p>

<p class="indent">Therefore, the water intake and output is fairly kept constant. This is called water balance. The average adult metabolizes 2.5–3.00 liters of water and a constant balance is maintained between intake and output. Inadequate water intake disturbs water equilibrium resulting in decreased urinary output, thereby causing changes in extracellular fluid (ECF) and intracellular fluid (ICF). The water equilibrium is maintained by kidneys, lungs, intestine and pituitary gland. The water balance coordinates with both electrolyte and acid-base balance.</p>

<p class="noindent">There are many different processes which control the movement of fluid and electrolytes between the ICF and ECF spaces. These processes include simple diffusion, facilitated diffusion, active transport, and osmosis, fluid presence (hydrostatic pressure and oncotic pressure).</p>
<div class="section" id="ch8lev2sec24"><h2 class="title">Simple Diffusion</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Diffusion is defined as the natural tendency of a substance or solutes to move from an area of higher concentration to that of lower concentration.</p></li>
<li><p class="">It occurs through the random movement of ions and molecules.</p></li>
<li><p class="">It occurs in liquids, gases, and solids. For example, exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between pulmonary capillaries and alveoli.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Net movement of the molecules stops when the concentrations are equal in both areas.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The membrane separating the two areas must be permeable to the diffusing substance for the process to occur.</p></li>
<li><p class="">These molecules move without external energy. Diffusion is an efficient mechanism for the movement of molecules in and out of cells. Diffusion does not require energy.</p></li>

<div class="section" id="ch8lev2sec25"><h2 class="title">Facilitated Diffusion</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Some molecules diffuse slowly into the cell because of the composition of cellular membrane. However, when they are combined with a specific carrier molecule, the rate of diffusion accelerates.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Like simple diffusion, facilitated diffusion moves molecules from an area of high concentration to one of low concentration.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Glucose transport into the cell is an example of facilitated diffusion. The hormone insulin increases the rate of facilitated diffusion of glucose in most tissues.</p></li>

<li><p class="">An increase in plasma osmolality, ECF volume depletion, pain, stress, and use of certain medications such as narcotics, barbiturates, and anesthetics-stress may be physiologic or psychologic.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The factors which suppressing ADH include hypo-osmolality of the ECF, increased blood volume, exposure to cold, acute alcohol ingestion, carbon dioxide inhalation, administration of some diuretics, lithium and some anti- psychotic medications.</p></li>
<li><p class="">ADH prevents urine production and promotes water reabsorption from the renal tubules. Stimulation of the thirst mechanism and ADH release usually occur concurrently in response to a body fluid deficit.</p></li>

<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Adrenal gland fluid volume is maintained by combinations of hormonal influences. ADH helps only water reabsorption.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Hormones released by the adrenal cortex helps to regulate both water and electrolytes.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Two groups of hormones secreted by the adrenal cortex include glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Primarily have an anti-inflammatory effect and increase serum glucose; whereas mineral affects corticoids (e.g., aldosterone) enhances sodium retention and potassium excretion.</p></li>
<li><p class="">When sodium is reabsorbed, water follows as a result of osmotic charges. “Cortisol” is most common hormone which has both gluco and mineralocorticoids properties.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) from the anterior pituitary is necessary for aldosterone secretions. Hypovolemia is a common clinical condition in which aldosterone is secreted to maintain homeostasis.</p></li>

<div class="section" id="ch8lev2sec41"><h2 class="title">Kidneys</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">The kidneys maintain fluid volume and concentration of urine by filtering the ECF through the glomeruli. Reabsorption and excretion of ECF occur in the renal tubules in response to ADH, aldosterone and atrial natriuretic peptides (ANP).</p></li>
<li><p class="">ANP released from the atria in response to atrial distention, vasoconstriction, or direct cardiac failure. These factors increase the excretion of sodium and water and results in vasodilatation.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Renal prostaglandins and renal renin-kinin system also increases sodium excretion.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">The major functions of kidneys in maintaining normal fluid balance include the following:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Regulation of ECF volume and osmolality by selective retention and excretion of body fluids. Regulation of electrolytes level in the ECF by selective retention of needed substances and excretion of unneeded substances.</p></li>

<div class="section" id="ch8lev2sec47"><h2 class="title">Fluid Volume Deficit</h2>
<p class="noindent">Fluid volume deficit (FVD) can be caused by a deficiency in the amount of both water and electrolytes in ECF, but the water and electrolytes proportions remain near normal. The state is commonly known as ‘hypovolemia’. Both osmotic and hydrostatic pressure changes force the interstitial fluid into intravascular space. As the interstitial space is depleted, its fluid becomes hypertonic, and cellular fluid is then drawn into the interstitial space, leaving cells without adequate fluid of function properly. Fluid volume deficit results from the loss of body fluids, especially if fluid intake is simultaneously decreased.</p>

<p class="indent">Sometimes dehydration is used as synonym for hypovolemia; technically it is wrong. Dehydration refers only to a decreased volume of water; but water is not decreased without electrolyte charges also. Hydration is the union of a substance with water and is often used to indicate that there is normal water volume in the body. <bold><a href="#ch8tbl3" class="ulink-inter">Table 8.3</a></bold> showing the nursing process steps application in diarrhea and <bold><a href="#ch8tbl4" class="ulink-inter">Table 8.4</a></bold> depicts the differences between the signs and symptoms of hypovolemia and hypervolemia.</p>

<div class="section" id="ch8lev2sec48"><h2 class="title">Fluid Volume Excess</h2>
<p class="noindent">Excessive retention of water and sodium in ECF in near-normal proportions results in a condition termed as fluid volume excess. It is also called “hypervolemia”. Overhydration refers only to above-normal amounts of water in extracellular spaces. Malfunction of the kidneys causing an inability to excrete, the success and failure of the heart to function as a pump resulting in accumulation of fluid in the lungs and dependent parts of the body, are common causes. When water is retained in excessive amount, so as sodium.</p>
<p class="indent">Due to increased extracellular osmotic pressure from the retained sodium, fluid is pulled from the cells to equalize the tonicity. By the time intracellular and extracellular spaces are isotonic to each other, an excess of both water and sodium are in ECF, while the cells are nearly depleted. The excessive ECF may accumulate in tissue spaces, and is known as edema: Edema can be observed around eyes, fingers ankles and sacral space and also accumulate in or around body organs. It may result in a weight gain in excess of 5%. When the excess fluid remains in the intravascular space, the concentration of solids in the blood is decreased.</p>
<p class="indent">Interstitial to plasma shift is the movement of fluid from the space surrounding the cells to the blood. The shift, also called hypervolemia is a compensatory response to volume or osmotic pressure changes of the intravascular fluid. Although the body attempts to maintain normal balance in all fluid spaces, the intravascular fluid is usually protected at the expense of interstitial fluid and ICF. <bold><a href="#ch8fig7" class="ulink-inter">Figure 8.7</a></bold> shows managing fluid balance. <bold><a href="#ch8fig8" class="ulink-inter">Figure 8.8</a></bold> shows the diagnosis and management of fluid volume excess.</p>

Using compression stockings and elevating the legs may also be recommended.</p>
</div>
</div><div class="section" id="ch8lev1sec13"><h1 class="title">ELECTROLYTES</h1>
<p class="noindent">Electrolytes are substances whose molecules dissociate or split into ions when placed in water. These substances are found in ECF and ICF that dissociate into electrically charged particles known as ‘ions’. ‘Cations’ are positively charged ions. For example, sodium (Na), potassium (K), calcium (Ca<sub>2</sub>) and magnesium (Mg), hydrogen (Hf) ions. ‘Anions’ are negative charged ions. For example, bicarbonates (HCO<sub>3</sub>), chloride (Cl) and phosphate (PC43) ions and proteins. The ionic charge is termed ‘valence’. Cations and anions combine according to their valency.</p>
<p class="indent">The concentration of electrolytes can be expressed in mol per deciliter (mol/dL), millimole per liter (mmol/L) or milliequivalent per liter (mEq/L). See the normal level of electrolytes in appendix. The role of electrolytes in cellular functions includes the following:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Regulation of water distribution, and osmolality.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Regulation of acid–base balance</p></li>
<li><p class="">Transmission of nerve impulses, i.e., neuromuscular activity</p></li>
<li><p class="">Contraction of muscles</p></li>
<li><p class="">Clotting of blood</p></li>
<li><p class="">Enzyme reaction.</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="ch8lev2sec60"><h2 class="title">Importance of Electrolytes</h2>
<p class="noindent">Electrolytes play a vital role in maintaining homeostasis within the body. They help to regulate heart and neurological function, fluid balance, oxygen delivery, acid–base balance and much more. Electrolyte imbalances can develop by the following mechanisms: excessive ingestion; diminished elimination of an electrolyte; diminished ingestion or excessive elimination of an electrolyte. The most common cause of electrolyte disturbances is kidney failure.</p>
<p class="indent">Electrolytes are important because they are what cells (especially nerve, heart and muscle cells) use to maintain voltages across their cell membranes and to carry electrical impulses (nerve impulses, muscle contractions) across themselves and to other cells. Kidneys work to keep the electrolyte concentrations in blood constant despite changes in the body. For example, during heavy exercise, electrolytes are lost in sweat, particularly in form of sodium and potassium. These electrolytes must be replaced to keep the electrolyte concentrations of the body fluids constant.</p>

<div class="section" id="ch8lev3sec7"><h3 class="title">Regulation or Electrolytes</h3>
<p class="noindent">Electrolytes regulate water distribution, regulate acid–base balance and maintain a balanced degree of neuromuscular excitability. There are many different kinds of electrolytes in the body. These include sodium (Na<sup>+</sup>), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg<sub>2</sub>), chloride (Cl), bicarbonate (HCO<sub>3</sub>), phosphate (PO<sub>4</sub>), etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch8lev3sec8"><h3 class="title">Sodium</h3>
<p class="noindent">Sodium is the chief electrolyte of ECF. It moves easily between intravascular and interstitial spaces and moves across cell membrane by active transport. Many chemical reactions in the body are influenced by sodium, particularly in nervous tissue cells and muscle tissue cells.</p>
<p class="noindent"><bold>The functions of sodium are as follows:</bold></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">It controls and regulates the volume of body fluids.</p></li>
<li><p class="">It maintains water balance throughout the body.</p></li>
<li><p class="">It is the primary regulator of ECF volume.</p></li>
<li><p class="">It influences ICF volume.</p></li>
<li><p class="">It participates in the generation and transmission of nerve impulses.</p></li>
<li><p class="">It is an essential electrolyte in the sodium- potassium pump.</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="ch8lev4sec1"><h4 class="title">Sources and Losses of Sodium</h4>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">An average daily intake is not known, but the average adult intake is eliminated to be between 6 and 15 mg and the RDA for sodium for adults is approximately 500 mg for 5 g.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Sodium is found in many foods, particularly bacon, ham, sausage, catsup, mustard, relish, processed cheese, canned vegetables, bread, cereal, and salted snack food. It is found in table salt (NaCl) which has about 46% sodium.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Sodium excess are eliminated primarily by the kidneys, small amounts are lost in feces and perspiration.<a name="page340"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">340</span></span></p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch8lev4sec2"><h4 class="title">Regulation of Sodium</h4>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Sodium normally is maintained in the body within a relatively narrow range, and deviations quickly result in a serious health problem.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Salt intake regulates sodium concentrations.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Sodium is conserved through reabsorption in the kidneys, a process of stimulation by aldosterone.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The normal extracellular concentrations of sodium is 135 to 145 mEq/L (mmol/L).</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch8lev3sec9"><h3 class="title">Potassium</h3>
<p class="noindent">Potassium is the major cation of ICF. Potassium and sodium work reciprocally. For example, an excessive intake of sodium results in an excretion of potassium and vice versa. The functions of potassium are as follows:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">It is the chief regulator of cellular enzyme activity and cellular water content.</p></li>
<li><p class="">It plays a vital role in such process as the transmission of electric impulses, particularly in nerve, heart, skeletal, intestinal, and lung tissue; protein and carbohydrate metabolism and cellular building.</p></li>
<li><p class="">It assists in regulation of acid–base balance by cellular exchange with H.</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="ch8lev4sec3"><h4 class="title">Sources and Losses of Potassium</h4>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">An average daily requirement of K is not known; but an intake of 50 to 100 mEq daily maintains potassium balance.</p></li>
<li><p class="">A well-balanced diet contains adequate quantities of potassium. Major sources include bananas, peaches, kiwi, figs, dates, apricots, oranges prunes, meloiis, raising, broccoli, and potatoes. Meat and dairy products also provide adequate amounts of potassium.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Potassium excreted primarily by the kidneys. The kidneys have no effective method of conserving potassium. Therefore, deficits develop readily if excreted in excess amount without being replaced simultaneously.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Gastrointestinal secretions contain potassium in large quantities. Some is also found in perspiration and saliva.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch8lev4sec4"><h4 class="title">Regulation of Potassium</h4>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Cellular potassium is conserved by the sodium pump when sodium is excluded.</p></li>

<li><p class="">Aldosterone secretions trigger potassium excretion in urine.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The normal range for serum potassium is 5 to 5 mEq/L.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch8lev3sec10"><h3 class="title">Calcium</h3>
<p class="noindent">Calcium is the most abundant electrolyte in the body. Up to 99% of the total amount of calcium in the body is found in bones and teeth in ionized form. There is close link between concentration of calcium and phosphorus.</p>
<p class="noindent"><bold>The functions of calcium are as follows:</bold></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">It is necessary for nerve impulse transmission and blood clotting.</p></li>
<li><p class="">It is catalyst for muscle contraction. Strength of contractions (especially cardiac muscle contraction) is directly related to the serum concentration of calcium ions.</p></li>
<li><p class="">It is needed for vitamin B<sub>12</sub> absorption and for its use by body cells.</p></li>
<li><p class="">It acts as a catalyst for many cell chemical activities.</p></li>
<li><p class="">It is necessary for strong bones and teeth.</p></li>
<li><p class="">It establishes thickness and strength of cell membrane.</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="ch8lev4sec5"><h4 class="title">Sources and Losses of Calcium</h4>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">The average daily requirements for calcium is about 1 g for adults. Higher amounts are required according to body weight; for children, for pregnant and lactating women, and postmenopausal women.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Calcium is found in milk, cheese and dried beans. Some calcium is present in meats and vegetables.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Use of calcium is stimulated by vitamin D. The most active form of vitamin D (calciferol) promotes calcium absorption and limits calcium excretion when levels are inadequate.</p></li>
<li><p class="">It leaves bones and teeth to maintain normal blood calcium levels, if necessary.</p></li>
<li><p class="">It is excreted in urine, feces, bile, digestive secretion and perspiration.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch8lev4sec6"><h4 class="title">Regulation of Calcium</h4>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">When ECF calcium levels decrease, the parathyroid glands increase the secretions of PTH, which acts on bones to increase the release of calcium into the blood and acts on the kidney, tubules and the intestinal mucosa to increase the absorption of calcium from the kidneys and the intestine.</p></li>
<li><p class="">A high serum phosphate concentration increases serum calcium; a low serum phosphate concentration decreases serum calcium.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Calcitonin, a hormone secreted by the thyroid gland has an opposite effect on calcium than PTH. Increase in calcitonin reduces the serum calcium concentration primarily by opposing osteoclast bone resorption.</p></li>

<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">It helps maintain acid–base balance.</p></li>
<li><p class="">It is involved in important chemical reactions in the body. For example, it is necessary for many B vitamins to be effective; helps promote nerve and muscle action, and plays role in carbohydrate metabolism.</p></li>
<li><p class="">It is important for cell division and for the transmission of heredity or hereditary traits. An average daily requirement for phosphorus is similar to those for calcium.

<p class="noindent">Human body contains quite a large volume of water as ICF and ECF and the fluid contains several inorganic ions such as sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, sulfate, phosphate, calcium and magnesium. The complex mechanism of human life maintains the concentration and volume of the body fluids at a constant level and in general, it is not influenced by dietary intake and metabolism, while kidneys play a vital role in maintaining the balance. When clients presents with deficit or excesses of sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium or phosphate, special nursing care is required.

<p class="noindent">Hyponatremia refers to a sodium deficit in ECF caused a by loss of sodium or gain of water. It is a condition on lowered level of plasma volume. In this condition, osmotic pressure changes result in ECF, moving into the cells. When this occurs, an examiner's fingerprints tend to remain on the client's skin over the sternum where pressure is applied with the fingers.</p>
<p class="indent"><bold><a href="#ch8fig10" class="ulink-inter">Figure 8.10</a></bold> shows signs and symptoms of hyponatremia.</p>
<p class="noindent"><bold>The related factors leading to hyponatremia are as follows:</bold></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Loss of sodium as in: Loss of GI fluids, use of diuretics; adrenal insufficiency</p></li>
<li><p class="">Gains of water as in: excessive administration of D5W, diseases associated with SIADH; pharmacological agents that impair renal water excretion</p></li>
<li><p class="">Hyponatremia or sodium depletion occurs from loss of body fluids through sweating, vomiting, diarrhea, intestinal fistula, dialysis and from aspiration of gastric contents</p></li>
<li><p class="">Chronic pyelonephritis, chronic uremia, diuretic phase of acute renal failure, diabetic ketoacidosis, cystic diseases of the kidney, and excessive or prolonged use of diuretics result in excessive loss of sodium through urine</p></li>
<li><p class="">Endocrine diseases show as myxoedema, Addison's disease, hyperaldosteronism, and uncontrolled diabetes mellitus also lead to sodium depletion.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Excessive loss of sodium can also occur through the skins as in extensive burns, generalized dermatitis and, etc., in children with cystic fibrosis.<a name="page343"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">343</span></span></p></li>

<p class="indent">Sodium is mainly an extracellular ion, and its depletion causes migration of water in the intracellular compartments, making the extracellular fluid hypotonic. Consequently, plasma becomes hypo-osmolar and plasma volume falls.</p>

</ul>
<p class="indent">This condition presents with tiredness, lethargy, muscular weakness, mental confusion, and in severe cases, convulsions and coma. The skin appears cold, pale and inelastic. Tongue is dry. Reduction in plasma volume causes reduction in cardiac output and results is tachycardia, fall of blood pressure and raised pulse rate. The eyeballs become soft due to reduced intraocular pressure, urine output is reduced and soon oliguria supervenes and finally leads to uremia. When the plasma serum concentration falls exaggeratedly to 120 mmol/L of blood or less, muscle cramps occur. It can produce acidosis and circulatory failure as complication.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch8lev3sec15"><h3 class="title">Treatment</h3>
<p class="noindent">Mild cases are treated with frequent drink of water with added sodium chloride or with isotonic (0.9%) saline solution by IV injection. In other cases, 2–4 liters of isotonic saline solution is given IV infusion for over 6–12 hours. More severe cases are treated with 2–3 liters of IV isotonic solution in first 2–3 hours, followed by further 2–5 liters within 24–48 hours. If there is associated water intoxication, water intake is restricted to 500–1,000 mL in 24 hours. In addition, the client is given treatment for the underlying condition.</p>

<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Identify clients at risk for hyponatremia</p></li>
<li><p class="">Monitor fluid losses and gains. Look for loss of sodium containing fluids, particularly in conjunction with low sodium intake</p></li>

<li><p class="">With clients able to consume a general diet, encourage foods and fluids with high sodium content</p></li>
<li><p class="">Be familiar with the sodium content of commonly used parenteral fluids. Monitor client with cardiovascular disease receiving sodium- containing fluids closely for sign of circulatory overload, such as moist rales in the lungs</p></li>
<li><p class="">Use extreme caution when administering hypertonic saline solution (3 to 5% NaC1). Beware that these fluids can be lethal if infused carelessly.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Avoid giving large water supplements to clients receiving isotonic tube feedings, particularly if routes of abnormal sodium loss are present or water is being retained abnormally.</p></li>

<div class="section" id="ch8lev2sec64"><h2 class="title">Hypernatremia (<a href="#ch8fig12" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 8.12</a>)</h2>
<p class="noindent">Hypernatremia or sodium excess refers to surplus of sodium in ECF that can result from excess water loss or overall excess of sodium. Because of the increased extracellular osmotic pressure, fluids move from the cells, leaving them without sufficient fluid. It is a condition which excess of sodium occurs in the ECF, giving rise to cellular dehydration.</p>
<p class="indent"><bold>The related factors which lead to hyponatremia are as follows:</bold></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Deprivation of water, most common in those unable to perceive or respond to thirst</p></li>
<li><p class="">Hypertonic tube feeding with inadequate water supplements</p></li>
<li><p class="">Increased insensible water loss (as in hyperventilation)</p></li>
<li><p class="">Ingestion of salt in unusual amounts</p></li>
<li><p class="">Excessive parenteral administration of sodium-containing solution.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Hypertonic saline (3 or 5% NaCl)</p></li>
<li><p class="">5% sodium bicarbonate</p></li>
<li><p class="">Isotonic saline</p></li>
<li><p class="">Profuse sweating</p></li>
<li><p class="">Diabetes insipidus</p></li>
<li><p class="">Heat stroke</p></li>
<li><p class="">Drowning in sea water</p></li>
<li><p class="">Hypernatremia also occurs when water losses of the body exceed sodium loss as is seen in diabetes insipidus, marked glycosuria, hypercalcemia, hypokalemia, chronic renal failure, and recovery phase of acute renal failure</p></li>
<li><p class="">Sodium excess may occur along with water excess when due to inadequate clearance of the kidneys both sodium and water accumulate in the extracellular space, leading to edema, for example, nephritic syndrome, cardiac failure, nutritional or thiamine deficiency, cirrhosis of liver, and in cases of usage of drugs such as corticosteroids, androgens, phenylbutazone, oral contraceptive and carbenoxolone. It causes retention of sodium, increased volume of ECF and edema in the interstitial compartment.</p></li>

<p class="noindent">Prevent hyponatremia in debilitated clients who are unable to perceive or respond to thirst by offering them fluids at regular intervals. If fluids intake remains inadequate, consult the physician in order to plan an alternate route for intake, either by tube feedings or by the parenteral route. If tube feedings are used, give sufficient water to keep the serum sodium and the BUN level within normal limits. Higher the osmolality of the feeding, the greater the need for water supplements.</p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="ch8lev2sec65"><h2 class="title">Hypokalemia</h2>
<p class="noindent">Hypokalemia refers to a potassium deficit in ECF. When the extracellular potassium level falls, potassium moves from the cell, creating an intracellular potassium deficiency. Sodium and hydrogen ions are then retained by the cells to maintain isotonic fluids. These electrolyte shifts influence normal cellular functioning, the pH of ECF, and function of most of the body systems. Skeletal muscles are generally the first to demonstrate a potassium deficiency. It is a condition associated with depletion of potassium characterized by muscular weakness, leg cramps, apathy, mental confusion and paralysis.</p>

<li><p class="">Identify clients at risk for hyperphosphatemia.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Monitor signs of tetanus and other features of hypocalcemia.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Beware that soft-tissue calcification can be long-term complication of a chemically elevated serum phosphate level. Calcification may occur in site such as kidney, arteries, joints, etc.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Administer prescribed oral or IV phosphate supplements cautiously and monitor serum phosphorus levels periodically during their use.</p></li>
<li><p class="">When appropriate, instruct clients that use of phosphate, containing laxatives may result in acute phosphate poisoning.</p></li>

<p class="noindent">An important property of blood is its degree of acidity or alkalinity. Blood acidity increases when the level of acidic compounds in the body rises (through increased intake or production, or decreased elimination) or when the level of basic (alkaline) compounds in the body falls (through decreased intake or production, or increased elimination). Blood alkalinity increases with the reverse processes. The body's balance between acidity and alkalinity is referred to as acid–base balance. The acidity or alkalinity of any solution, including blood, is indicated on the pH scale. The blood's acid–base balance is precisely controlled because even a minor deviation from the normal range can severely affect many organs. The body uses different mechanisms to control the blood's acid–base balance.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch8lev2sec73"><h2 class="title">Role of the Lungs</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">One mechanism the body uses to control blood pH involves the release of carbon dioxide from the lungs.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Carbon dioxide, which is mildly acidic, is a waste product of the metabolism of oxygen (which all cells need) and, as such, is constantly produced by cells. As with all waste products, carbon dioxide gets excreted into the blood.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The blood carries carbon dioxide to the lungs, where it is exhaled. As carbon dioxide accumulates in the blood, the pH of the blood decreases (acidity increases).</p></li>
<li><p class="">The brain regulates the amount of carbon dioxide that is exhaled by controlling the speed and depth of breathing.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The amount of carbon dioxide exhaled, and consequently the pH of the blood, increases as breathing becomes faster and deeper.</p></li>
<li><p class="">By adjusting the speed and depth of breathing, the brain and lungs are able to regulate the blood pH minute by minute.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch8lev2sec74"><h2 class="title">Role of the Kidneys</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">The kidneys are able to affect blood pH by excreting excess acids or bases.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The kidneys have some ability to alter the amount of acid or base that is excreted, but because the kidneys make these adjustments more slowly than the lungs do, this compensation generally takes several days.</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="ch8lev3sec45"><h3 class="title">Buffer Systems</h3>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Buffer systems is a mechanism for controlling blood pH involves the use of buffer systems, which guard against sudden shifts in acidity and alkalinity.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The pH buffer systems are combinations of the body's own naturally occurring weak acids and weak bases. These weak acids and bases exist in pairs that are in balance under normal pH conditions. The pH buffer systems work chemically to minimize changes in the pH of a solution by adjusting the proportion of acid and base. The most important pH buffer system in the blood involves carbonic acid (a weak acid formed from the carbon dioxide dissolved in blood) and bicarbonate ions (the corresponding weak base).</p></li>

<div class="section" id="ch8lev2sec79"><h2 class="title">Pathophysiology</h2>
<p class="noindent">Nurses need an understanding of the pathophysiology of fluid and electrolyte balance to anticipate, identify, and respond to possible imbalances.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Concentrations:</bold> Electrolyte concentrations vary from those in the ICF to those in the ECF.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Sodium:</bold> Sodium ions outnumber any other cations in the ECF; therefore it is essential in the fluid regulation of the body.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Potassium:</bold> The ECF has a low concentration of potassium and can tolerate only small changes in its concentrations.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Maintenance:</bold> The body expends a great deal of energy in maintaining the sodium and potassium concentrations through cell membrane pumps that exchange sodium and potassium ions.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Osmosis:</bold> When two different solutions are separated by a membrane that is impermeable to the dissolved substances, fluid shifts from the region of low solute concentration to the high solute concentration until the solutions are of equal concentrations.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Diffusion:</bold> Diffusion is the natural tendency of a substance to move in an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration.</p></li>

<li><p class=""><bold>Loss of body fluids:</bold> FVD results from loss of body fluids and occurs more rapidly when coupled with decreased fluid intake.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Fluid overload:</bold> Fluid volume excess may be related to a simple fluid overload or diminished function of the homeostatic mechanisms responsible for regulating fluid balance.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Low or high electrolyte intake:</bold> Diets low or excessive in electrolytes could also cause electrolyte imbalances.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Medications:</bold> There are certain medications that could lead to electrolyte imbalances when taken against the physician's orders.</p></li>

<p class="noindent">When patients experience deficient fluid volume, intravenous (IV) fluids are often prescribed. IV fluid restores fluid to the intravascular compartment, and some IV fluids are also used to facilitate the movement of fluid between compartments due to osmosis. There are three types of IV fluids: isotonic, hypotonic, and hypertonic.<a name="page360"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">360</span></span></p>

<p class="noindent">Total intake should be nearly equal to total output every day, but some fluids, referred to as “insensible losses,” cannot be measured, such as fluids lost through the respiratory system, sweat, and stool. Therefore, urine is the most commonly measured output. Nurses should check with the plan of care to find out if their clients’ intake and output should be monitored. So, every time one of these clients receives or loses fluids in any way, the exact volume can be recorded. These volumes are then totaled at the end of every shift and then at the end of a 24-hour period.<a name="page363"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">363</span></span></p>

<p class="noindent">For fluid intake, you’ll need to count:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p class="">Anything the client drinks, including water and beverages.</p></li>
<li><p class="">All foods that are liquid at room temperature, like ice cream, gelatin, sherbert, pudding, custard, ice chips, and popsicles.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The fluids provided through intravenous therapy, enteral, or total parenteral nutrition.</p></li>
</ol>
<div class="section" id="ch8lev3sec62"><h3 class="title">Procedure</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p class="">Add all fluid volumes served to that client. For example, during your shift, the client could have been served with 200 mL of water, 360 mL of soda, and 140 mL of milk. All together, these equal 700 mL.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Put on your gloves and transfer whatever has remained from each liquid into a graduated measuring container. Remember to keep the graduate even and at eye level to ensure precise measurements.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Subtract the volume in the graduate from the total volume of fluid served to the client. For example, if the volume left in the graduate is 80 mL, this is subtracted from the full serving amount of 700 mL, giving us a total fluid intake of 620 mL.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Remove your gloves and practice hand hygiene.</p></li>
</ol>
</div>

<div class="section" id="ch8lev2sec105"><h2 class="title">Measuring Fluid Output</h2>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p class="">Urine</p></li>
<li><p class="">Vomitus</p></li>
<li><p class="">Wound drainage</p></li>
<li><p class="">Diarrhea</p></li>
<li><p class="">Blood</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="indent">Special precautions are required for certain clients, like those undergoing chemotherapy, because their urine, stool, and vomit can contain the chemotherapy agent. Once again, your supplies include:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p class="">Gloves</p></li>
<li><p class="">A graduated container</p></li>
<li><p class="">If there's a possibility of splashing, personal protective equipment, such as a gown, goggles or face shield, and a mask</p></li>
</ol>
<div class="section" id="ch8lev3sec63"><h3 class="title">Procedure</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p class="">Provide these clients with urine receptacles specifically labeled with their name and bed location. Tell them to only urinate in these receptacles and notify you when they are finished before discarding the contents.
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p class="">Commonly used urine receptacles are specimen “hats” that can be positioned under the toilet seat or a bedside commode to collect urine.</p></li>
</ol>
</p></li>
<li><p class="">Collect all forms of the client's fluid output into a receptacle with volume marks. Most receptacles already have volume marks, but not all of them.
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p class="">If the client is using a bedpan or catheter drainage bag, empty their contents into a graduated container.</p></li>
<li><p class="">If the client vomits, collect it in an emesis basin. Blood and wound drainage might be collected in drainage pouches. If the emesis basin and drainage pouch don't have volume marks, pour the contents of both receptacles into a graduate.</p></li>
</ol>
</p></li>
<li><p class="">Hold the receptacle or graduate at eye level to measure the fluid volume.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Empty the contents into the toilet and clean, rinse, and disinfect both the receptacle or graduate as well as the toilet.</p></li>
<li><p class="">You may also have to assess the volume of fluid losses outside of containers. This could be the case if a client has vomited out of the emesis basin, if there's blood or wound drainage not contained in a drainage pouch, as well as in the case of diarrhea.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Remove your gloves and practice hand hygiene.</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch8lev3sec64"><h3 class="title">Documentation</h3>
<p class="noindent">When measuring a client's fluid intake and output, be sure to report the following to the healthcare provider:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p class="">Changes in the usual amount of intake; for example, a client refusing to drink the served fluids.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Changes in the color, clarity, or odor of the output.</p></li>

<li><p class="">Safeguard the site and be aware of tubing and pump during transfers, ambulation, or other activities.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Change the IV dressing every 72 hours and if it becomes wet or contaminated with drainage.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Wear gloves when changing dressings or tubing</p></li>
<li><p class="">Be sure to double-check all clamps when changing tubing, adding medications, or removing IV tubing (from a pump or controller).</p></li>
<li><p class="">If the rate of flow is not regulated properly, it could result in the client receiving a bolus of mediation.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Always check to make sure medications, solutions, or additives are compatible before adding into existing solutions.</p></li>

In a hemolytic reaction, there is clumping of the erythrocytes which blocks the capillaries. Causes the erythrocytes to disintegrate and release hemoglobin into the blood. It eventually gets into the kidney tubules. Their blockage produces kidney failure. The symptoms of hemolytic reaction are chills, fever, and headache of back pain, then dyspnea, cyanosis, chest pain and oliguria.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Pyrogenic reactions:</bold> It is due to bacterial contamination of the blood or of the administration set. The symptoms are fever, shaking chills warm flushed skin, headache, black pain and nausea which progress on to hematemesis, diarrhea and delirium.</p></li>

</div><div class="section" id="ch8lev1sec25"><h1 class="title">FLUID RESTRICTION</h1>
<p class="noindent">A fluid restriction is when an individual is advised to take a limited amount of fluid each day. This might be recommended by the doctors to prevent fluid building up in the body, or to reduce excess fluid that is already there. This extra fluid can cause a patient to look puffy (swell around their face and ankles), cause a rapid increase in weight and increase their blood pressure. Some examples of conditions that often need a fluid restriction include: end-stage kidney disease, renal dialysis, heart failure. The amount of fluid recommended varies depending on several factors, including the patient's body size and their health conditions. The Doctors will advise ward staff on the most appropriate volume of water to be taken. Although there are many different circumstances where a person may be prescribed to follow a fluid restriction diet, some of the more common medical conditions and associated symptoms requiring fluid restriction are listed below:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Heart problems, including congestive heart failure (CHF)</p></li>
<li><p class="">Kidney problems, including end stage renal disease (ESRD) and people undergoing dialysis</p></li>

<div class="section" id="ch8lev2sec132"><h2 class="title">Treatment Considerations and Tips</h2>
<p class="noindent">In addition to following a low-sodium diet and taking diuretics (“water pills”) as prescribed by your healthcare provider, a fluid restriction can help to achieve your health goals. Depending on the fluid limit outlined for your condition and prescribed by your healthcare provider the following are strategies to help manage your daily fluid intake:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Plan out the amount of liquid will have during the day:</bold> how much will you drink to take your medications? How much will you drink with your meals? In order to decide what works best for you, it is helpful to sit down with a nutritionist or nurse and talk with friends and family who may be able to support you. By identifying preferred drinks and your drinking pattern, you will more easily be able to decide how to adjust to your fluid restriction.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Use small cups:</bold> Using a small cup can give the perception of a full glass.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Use a designated container:</bold> Some people find it helpful to measure out their daily fluid allowance in one large container and drink only from there throughout the day.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Maintain good oral care:</bold> By brushing your teeth after meals, rinsing with alcohol free mouthwash, chewing sugarless gum or sucking on hard candy you may be able to decrease dry mouth and urges to drink.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Avoid foods with high levels of sodium (salt):</bold> These types of foods will increase your thirst.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Weigh yourself daily:</bold> It is important to use the same scale around the same time each day to get the most accurate information and report any weight gain of 2 pounds or more in one day to your physician.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Record the fluid intake:</bold> Recording your fluid intake will help make sure that you are not taking in more fluids than expected. It is a good idea to write this information on a tracking log/calendar (a sample is attached).</p></li>

<p class="noindent">The main fluid in the body is water. 60% of the total body weight is water. The water is distributed in three main compartments separated from each other by cell membranes. The intracellular compartment is the area within the cell. The extracellular compartment consists of the interstitial area (between and around cells) and the inside of the blood vessels (plasma). Electrolytes are the chemicals dissolved in the body fluid.<a name="page375"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">375</span></span> The distribution has important consequences for the ultimate balance of fluids. Fluid and electrolyte disorders are volume related, compositional, or both. Diagnosis and therapy focuses on measurements such as blood pressure, pulse, central venous pressure, serum electrolyte values, arterial blood gas partial pressures, and pH. These are, however, gross indicators of what are really important: normal cellular function and satisfactory, if not optimal, metabolic status. Normal compensatory responses to fluid and electrolyte abnormalities preserve volume and composition. In the extreme, however, composition (e.g., electrolyte content) is sacrificed to ensure adequate volume. The “volumes” of importance are blood (plasma), interstitial fluid [functional extracellular fluid (FECV)], and intracellular fluid (ICF). Thus, mechanisms that initially act to maintain oxygen delivery at the cellular level ultimately can result in hyperosmolar or hypo-osmolar states that may be life-threatening. The proper analysis of fluid/electrolyte problems is a three-dimensional approach. This approach involves assessing: (1) the total mass or total body stores of each electrolyte, which is the product of its concentration and the volume of its distribution; (2) the rate of electrolyte movement in and out of the body, i.e., balance; and (3) the movement of each electrolyte in and out of each compartment, i.e., changes in body composition, in health and various pathophysiologic states. Electrolytes are essential for normal cellular function. Alterations in circulating electrolyte concentrations are common in critically ill patients and occur in most patients admitted to the intensive care unit during their hospital stay. Abnormal electrolyte concentrations reflect altered metabolic status. The most common form of monitoring composition of the body fluids is measuring electrolyte concentrations in fluids, particularly serum.</p>
