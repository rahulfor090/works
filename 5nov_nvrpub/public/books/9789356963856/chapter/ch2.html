<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Nursing process:</bold> Nursing process is a systematic, rational method of planning and providing individualized nursing care.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Nursing diagnosis:</bold> A nursing diagnosis is a clinical judgment concerning a human response to health conditions/life processes, or vulnerability for that response, by an individual, family, group or community. A nursing diagnosis provides the basis for selection of nursing interventions to achieve outcomes for which the nurse has accountability.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Problem-focused nursing diagnosis:</bold> A clinical judgment concerning an undesirable human response to health conditions/life processes that exists in an individual, family, group, or community.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Syndrome:</bold> A clinical judgment concerning a specific cluster of nursing diagnoses that occur together, and are best addressed together and through similar interventions.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Actual:</bold> Identifies an occurring health problem</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Potential:</bold> Identifies a high-risk health problem</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Wellness:</bold> Focused on promoting or enhancing a patient's level of wellness.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Evaluation:</bold> Assessing the client's response to nursing interventions and then comparing the response to the goals or outcome criteria written in the planning phase.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Planning:</bold> Planning expected outcomes to resolve or minimize the identified problems of the client. In collaboration with the client, the nurse develops specific nursing intervention for each nursing diagnosis.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Authority</bold>: The power or supposed right to give commands, enforce obedience, take action, or make final decisions.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Critical listening:</bold> A mode of monitoring how we are listening so as to maximize our accurate understanding of what another person is saying.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Reasoning:</bold> The mental processes of those who reason; especially the drawing of conclusions or inferences from observations, facts, or hypotheses; the evidence or arguments used in this procedure.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Reasoned judgment:</bold> Any belief or conclusion reached on the basis of careful thought and reflection, distinguished from mere or unreasoned opinion on the one hand, and from sheer fact on the other.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Problem-solving:</bold> Whenever a problem cannot be solved formulaically or robotically, critical thinking is required— first, to determine the nature and dimensions of the problem, and then, in the light of the first, to determine the considerations, points of view, concepts, theories, data, and reasoning relevant to its solution.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Problem:</bold> A question, matter, situation, or person that is perplexing or difficult to figure out, handle, or resolve. Problems, such as questions, can be divided into many types. Each has a (particular) logic.<a name="page49"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">49</span></span></p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Principle:</bold> A fundamental truth, law, doctrine, value, or commitment, upon which others are based. Rules, which are more specific, and often superficial and arbitrary, are based on principles. Rules are more algorithmic; they needn't be understood to be followed.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Logic:</bold> Correct reasoning or the study of correct reasoning and its foundations. The relationships between propositions (supports, assumes, implies, contradicts, counts against, is relevant to).</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Knowledge:</bold> The act of having a clear and justifiable grasp of what is so or of how to do something. Knowledge is based on understanding or skill, which in turn are based on thought, study, and experience.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Intuition:</bold> The direct knowing or learning of something without the conscious use of reasoning. We sometimes seem to know or learn things without recognizing how we came to that knowledge. When this occurs, we experience an inner sense that what we believe is true.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Insight:</bold> The ability to see and clearly and deeply understand the inner nature of things. Instruction for critical thinking fosters insight rather than mere performance; it cultivates the achievement of deeper knowledge and understanding through insight.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Humility:</bold> Recognizing one's own limitations and liability to error, and avoiding arrogance. Open-mindedness to submitting ideas to the critical reactions of others. Avoiding the mistake of thinking that superior knowledge confers infallibility or omniscience.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Empirical implication:</bold> That which follows from a situation or fact, not due to the logic of language, but from experience or scientific law. The redness of the coil on the stove empirically implies dangerous heat.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Empirical:</bold> Relying or based on experiment, observation, or experience rather than on theory or meaning.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Domains of thought:</bold> Thinking can be oriented or structured with different issues or purposes in view. Thinking varies in accordance with purpose and issue.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Dialogical thinking:</bold> Thinking that involves a dialogue or extended exchange between different points of view or frames of reference. Students learn best in dialogical situations, in circumstances in which they continually express their views to others and try to fit other's views into their own.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Data:</bold> Facts, figures, or information from which conclusions can be inferred, or upon which interpretations or theories can be based. As critical thinkers we must make certain to distinguish hard data from the inferences or conclusions we draw from them.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Critique:</bold> An objective judging, analysis, or evaluation of something. The purpose of critique is the same as the purpose of critical thinking: to appreciate strengths as well as weaknesses, virtues as well as failings. Critical thinkers critique in order to redesign, remodel, and make better.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Critical writing:</bold> To express ourselves in language requires that we arrange our ideas in some relationships to each other.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Concept:</bold> An idea or thought, especially a generalized idea of a thing or of a class of things. Humans think within concepts or ideas.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Assumption:</bold> A statement accepted or supposed as true without proof or demonstration; an unstated premise or belief. All human thought and experience is based on assumptions. Our thought must begin with something we take to be true in a particular context. We are typically unaware of what we assume and therefore rarely question our assumptions.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Accurate:</bold> Free from errors, mistakes, or distortion. Correct connotes little more than absence of error; accurate implies a positive exercise of one to obtain conformity with fact or truth; exact stresses perfect conformity to fact, truth, or some standard; precise suggests minute accuracy of detail.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Critical thinking:</bold> Thinking that involves the principled application of standards and criteria in the evaluation of practical and theoretical options for the purpose of reaching conclusions about those options.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Argument</bold>: A kind of rationale in which the reason(s) are intended to be taken as evidence for believing the conclusion.<a name="page50"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">50</span></span></p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Branch</bold>: One of multiple chains in a rationale that lead to the same conclusion.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Cause</bold>: A reason in an explanation.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Chain</bold>: A sequence of reasons connected by principles which lead directly from the terminal reason to the conclusion.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Deduction</bold>: A form of reasoning in which the premises given are intended to be taken as deductively implying the conclusion.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Deductive implication</bold>: A logical relation between premises and conclusion in which it is impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion false.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Deductive validit</bold>y: Synonymous with deductive implication. A rationale that deductively implies its conclusion is said to be deductively valid.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Evidence</bold>: A reason in an argument. Evidence provides a basis for believing a conclusion to be true.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Explanation</bold>: A kind of rationale in which the reason(s) are intended to be taken as the cause(s) of the fact represented by the conclusion.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Fact</bold>: The actual state of affairs represented by a true statement. (e.g., “Bill is a cat”, if true, represents the fact that Bill is a cat.)</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Fallacy</bold>: A systematic mistake in reasoning.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Induction</bold>: A form of reasoning in which the premises are intended to inductively imply the conclusion.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Inductive implication</bold>: A logical relation between premises and conclusion in which it is very unlikely for the premises to be true and the conclusion false.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Inductive strength</bold>: A measure of the degree to which a rationale inductively implies its conclusion.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Inductive validity</bold>: Synonymous with inductively valid and inductively strong. A rationale that inductively implies its conclusion is said to be inductively strong or inductively valid.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Instance</bold>: A reason that is a relatively concrete example of its conclusion. Instances are not connected by principles.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Opinion</bold>: The belief that a certain statement is true.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Practical implication</bold>: A logical relation in which a reason, either explanatory or argumentative in nature, implies its conclusion, and no known exceptions to the principle apply to the case at hand.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Premise</bold>: Any statement made in support of a conclusion.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Principle</bold>: A generalized conditional statement that provides the rational connection between a reason and a conclusion.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Rationale</bold>: The logical structure composed of reason(s) supporting a conclusion. There are two types of rationale: argument and explanation.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Reason</bold>: A statement given in practical support of a conclusion. There are two types of reason: cause and evidence.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Reasoning</bold>: The process of constructing or analyzing rationales.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Terminal reason</bold>: The final reason in a chain of reasoning. <bold>Statement</bold>: A sentence that is intended to be taken as either true or false.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Subject</bold>: The basic situation or events that reasoning is concerned with. The subject is not a statement, and it is <span class="italic">not</span> synonymous with the issue.</p></li>

</div><div class="section" id="ch2lev1sec3"><h1 class="title">INTRODUCTION</h1>
<p class="noindent">Nurses face an endless variety of situations involving client's family members, healthcare staff, and peers. Each situation poses new experiences and problems-involving client's care, different approaches to resolving problems, and different results as to whether approaches were successful. In every clinical situation, it is important for a nurse to think critically and make sound judgments so that clients ultimately receive the very best nursing care. Critical thinking is not a simple step-by-step, linear process that can be learned overnight. It is a process acquired only through hard work, commitment, and an active curiosity toward learning. Ideally, critical thinking becomes a habit of mind, a part of each nurse's character.</p>
</div><div class="section" id="ch2lev1sec4"><h1 class="title">CRITICAL THINKING AND NURSING JUDGMENT</h1>
<p class="noindent">Critical thinking is the art of thinking about your thinking while you are thinking in order to make your thinking better—more clear, more accurate, or more defensible. It includes five modes of thinking: total recall, habits, inquiry, new ideas and creativity. Critical thinking helps the nurse to find options for solving client's problems. Both the nurse and the client need to be effective thinkers so that they can find the problems accurately and set realistic outcomes. By using critical thinking they can plan, implement and evaluate quality care.</p>

<div class="section" id="ch2lev2sec1"><h2 class="title">Definitions of Critical Thinking</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Norris (1989) defined “Critical thinking as reasonable and reflective thinking that is focused upon deciding what do believe or do”.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Miller and Malcom, “Critical thinking is a cognitive process that involves weighing the accuracy and logic of evidence-an understanding of the nature of valid inferences, abstractions and generalizations”.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch2lev2sec2"><h2 class="title">Meaning of Critical Thinking</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Critical thinking is a form of judgment, specifically purposeful and reflective judgment. Using critical thinking one makes a decision or solves the problem of judging what to believe or what to do, but does so in a reflective way.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Critical thinking gives due consideration to the evidence, the context of judgment, the relevant criteria for making that judgment well, the applicable methods or techniques for forming that judgment, and the applicable theoretical constructs for understanding the nature of the problem and the question at hand.</p></li>
<li><p class="">These elements also happen to be the key defining characteristics of professional fields and academic disciplines. This is why critical thinking can occur within a given subject field (by reference to its specific set of permissible questions, evidence sources, criteria, etc.) and across subject fields in all those spaces where human beings need to interact and make decisions, solve problems, and figure out what to believe and what to do.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Within the framework of scientific skepticism, the process of critical thinking involves acquiring information and evaluating it to reach a well-justified conclusion or answer. Part of critical thinking comprises informal logic.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">In a seminal study on critical thinking and education in 1941, Edward Glaser defines critical thinking as follows“.</p>
<p class="indent"><bold><a href="#ch2fig2" class="ulink-inter">Figure 2.2</a></bold> depicts the core competencies of critical thinking.</p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="ch2lev2sec3"><h2 class="title">Elements of Critical Thinking</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Identification of premises and conclusions:</bold> Critical thinkers break arguments into basic statements and draw logical implications.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Clarification of arguments:</bold> Critical thinkers locate ambiguity and vagueness in arguments and propositions.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Establishment of facts:</bold> Critical thinkers determine if the premises are reasonable and identify information that has been omitted or not collected. They determine if the implications are logical and search for potentially contradictory data.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Evaluation of logic:</bold> Critical thinkers determine if the premises support the conclusion. In deductive arguments, the conclusions must be true if the premises are true. In inductive arguments, the conclusions are likely if the premises are true.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Final evaluation:</bold> Critical thinkers weigh the evidence and arguments. Supporting data, logic and evidence increase the weight of an argument. Contradictions and lack of evidence decrease the weight of an argument. Critical thinkers do not accept propositions if they think there is more evidence against them or if the argument is unclear, omits significant information, or has false premises or poor logic.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent"><bold><a href="#ch2fig3" class="ulink-inter">Figure 2.3</a></bold> shows the elements of reasoning.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch2lev2sec4"><h2 class="title">Components of Critical Thinking</h2>
<p class="noindent">Every process or method is made of essential components, and critical thinking is no different. These components provide a structure to the process, which if incorporated, makes persuasive, truthful and supportive verbal communication possible to highly influence others’ points of view and message acceptance. The major components in critical thinking include—perception, assumptions, emotion, language, argument, fallacy, logic, and problem solving.<a name="page52"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">52</span></span></p>
<div class="figure" id="ch2fig3" data-label="Fig. 2.3"><div class="title"><span class="item-label">Fig. 2.3</span> Elements of reasoning.</div><img alt="Fig. 2.3" src="/MediumImage/52-1.jpg"><div class="additional-markup"></div></div>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Perception:</bold> Perception is considered to be the manner in which individuals receive, interpret and translate experiences. How individuals perceive things works to define how they think. Perception tends to provide individuals a significant filtering system.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Assumptions:</bold> Assumptions are central to critical thinking. They tend to be implied, where individuals are not always conscious of them. Assumptions are not always bad and often rest on the notion that some ideas are obvious. They tend to make individuals comfortable with their present beliefs, shutting out any alternatives.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Emotion:</bold> Trying to leave emotion out of almost anything is impossible as it is part of everything people do and think. Emotions are the number one cause of creating and putting into place thinking and operating barriers, which are continually used as a defense mechanism. Critical thinkers do not ignore or deny emotions but learn to accept and manage them.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Language:</bold> Thinking cannot be separated from language since both tend to have three primary purposes—to inform, persuade and explain. Language denotes (designates meanings) and connotes (implies or suggests something), and relies heavily on the use of metaphors. Metaphors are powerful language tools, which are able to influence how individuals think and problem solve. These figures of speech give great color and depth to one's language. Metaphors can be short phrases, stories, or even poetic renditions and is a verbal message that listeners can easily interpret and visualize.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Argument:</bold> An argument is a claim, which is used to persuade that something is (or is not) true, or should (or should not) be done. An argument contains three basic elements—an issue, one or more reasons or premises, and one or more conclusions. An argument can be either valid or invalid based on its structure and only premises and conclusions are reached, which are either true or false.</p>
<p class="indent">The goal of critical thinking is to implement a sound argument, which has both a valid or proper structure and contains true premises. This is where using logic makes all the difference.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Fallacy:</bold> Reasoning that does not meet the criteria for being a sound argument is considered erroneous, or fallacious. A fallacy comes from incorrect patterns of reasoning. However, it does not always mean that the conclusion is false, but it does underscore the fact that the reasoning used to support it is not: valid, based on true premises, or complete and does not include all necessary relevant information.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Logic:</bold> Logic incorporates two methods or types of reasoning—deductive and inductive. Deductive reasoning relies on facts, certainty, syllogisms, validity, truth of premises sound arguments and supported conclusions. Inductive reasoning relies on diverse facts, probability, generalizations, hypotheses, analogies and inductive strength.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch2lev2sec5"><h2 class="title">Importance of Critical Thinking</h2>
<p class="noindent">Nurses play a critical role in patient care. When someone is sick, they count on nurses to administer their care, track their health, and communicate with their doctor to help them get better. Nurses who excel in critical thinking can substantially better perform these tasks, setting themselves up for career success.</p>
<p class="indent"><bold><a href="#ch2fig4" class="ulink-inter">Figure 2.4</a></bold> depicts the levels and components of critical</p>
<p class="noindent">thinking.</p>
<p class="indent">It also generally requires ability to recognize problems, to find workable means for meeting those problems, to gather and marshal pertinent information, to recognize unstated assumptions and values, to comprehend and use language with accuracy, clarity, and discrimination, to interpret data, to appraise evidence and evaluate arguments, to recognize the existence (or nonexistence) of logical relationships between propositions, to draw warranted conclusions and generalizations, to put to test the conclusions and generalizations at which one arrives, to reconstruct one's patterns of beliefs on the basis of wider experience, and to render accurate judgments about specific things and qualities in everyday life.<a name="page53"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">53</span></span></p>
<div class="figure" id="ch2fig4" data-label="Fig. 2.4"><div class="title"><span class="item-label">Fig. 2.4</span> Levels and components of critical thinking.</div><img alt="Fig. 2.4" src="/MediumImage/53-1.jpg"><div class="additional-markup"></div></div>
<p class="indent">The ability to think critically, as conceived in this volume, involves three things—an attitude of being disposed to consider in a thoughtful way the problems and subjects that come within the range of one's experiences, knowledge of the methods of logical inquiry and reasoning, and some skill in applying those methods. Critical thinking calls for a persistent effort to examine any belief or supposed form of knowledge in the light of the evidence that supports it and the further conclusions to which it tends.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch2lev2sec6"><h2 class="title">Critical Thinking Compentencies</h2>
<p class="noindent">The thinking competency encompasses the knowledge, skills, and processes we associate with intellectual development. It is through their competency as thinkers that students take subject-specific concepts and content and transform them into new understanding. Thinking competence requires specific thinking skills as well as habits of mind and metacognitive awareness. Critical thinkers are in high demand in the workplace because companies always need better, more informed solutions.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p class=""><bold>Describe:</bold> Clearly define what you are talking about, what is precisely involved, where it happened, and under what circumstances.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Reflection:</bold> Reconsidering a topic in light of new information or experiences or considering another point of view.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Analyze:</bold> Examine something, then describe how it works, making sure to compare and contrast its many components and comprehend how it relates to your subject or issue.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Criticizing:</bold> Identifying and examining an argument's weaknesses and acknowledging its strengths. It is vital to consider criticizing neutral and not harmful.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Reasoning:</bold> Using techniques like cause-and-effect to show logical reasoning and providing evidence that supports or refutes a claim.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Evaluating:</bold> Includes making judgments about the worth of something or the success or failure of something.</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
</div><div class="section" id="ch2lev1sec5"><h1 class="title">ATTITUDE FOR CRITICAL THINKING</h1>
<p class="noindent">Certain attitudes are crucial to critical thinking. These attitudes are based on the assumption that a rational person is motivated to develop, learn, grow, and be concerned with what to do or believe. A critical thinker works to develop the following nine attitudes or traits: independence, fair-mindedness, insight, intellectual humility, intellectual courage, integrity, perseverance, confidence, and curiosity.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p class=""><bold>Independence:</bold> Critical thinking requires that individuals think for themselves. Critical thinkers consider seriously a wide range of ideas, learn from them, and then make their own judgments about them.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Fair-mindedness:</bold> Critical thinkers are fair-minded and make impartial judgments. They assess all viewpoints with the same standards and do not base their judgments on personal or group bias or prejudice.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Insight into egocentricity:</bold> Critical thinkers are open to the possibility that their personal biases or social pressures and customs could unduly affect their thinking. They actively try to examine their own biases and bring them to awareness each time they think or make a decision.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Intellectual humility:</bold> It means having an awareness of the limits of one's own knowledge. Critical thinkers are willing to admit what they do not know; they are willing to seek new information and to rethink their conclusions in light of new knowledge.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Intellectual courage to challenge the status quo and rituals:</bold> With an attitude of courage, a nurse is willing to consider and examine fairly his or her own ideas or views, especially those to which the nurse may have a strongly negative reaction.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Integrity:</bold> Intellectual integrity requires that individuals apply the same rigorous standards of proof to their own knowledge and beliefs as they apply to the knowledge and beliefs of others.<a name="page54"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">54</span></span></p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Perseverance:</bold> Because critical thinking is a lifelong endeavor, nurses who are critical thinkers show perseverance in finding effective solutions to client and nursing problems.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Confidence:</bold> Critical thinkers believe that well-reasoned thinking will lead to trustworthy conclusions. Therefore, they cultivate an attitude of confidence in the reasoning process and examine emotion-laden arguments using the standards for evaluating thought.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Curiosity:</bold> The curious nurse may value tradition but is not afraid to examine traditions to be sure they are still valid.</p></li>
</ol>
</div><div class="section" id="ch2lev1sec6"><h1 class="title">CRITICAL THINKING IN NURSING</h1>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Healthcare consumers of the modern day know their rights and want to take an active consumer orientation, require nurses to develop critical thinking skills that utilize logical and intuitive approaches to solve problems.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Critical thinking is an essential quality in patient care management. Critical thinking is a special acquired skill used to generate, apply, analyze, synthesize and evaluate information is crucial for nursing professionals.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The need for this skill is determined by nursing, commitment to the care of the total person, nursing's contact with persons of varying sociocultural and religious backgrounds, and the recognition that nursing is both an art and a science.</p></li>

<li><p class="">Critical thinking is a reasoning process by which individuals reflect on analyze their own thoughts, actions, and knowledge.</p></li>
<li><p class="">To be a good critical thinking requires dedication and a desire to grow intellectually. A nurse learns that for each client cared for, there is a large source of scientific knowledge and practice-based information to consider.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The depth of nursing knowledge coupled with knowledge of each client's unique clinical situation makes it challenging to provide the most appropriate plan of care for a client.</p></li>
<li><p class="">As a beginning nurse, it is important to learn the steps of the nursing process and to incorporate the elements of elements of critical thinking.</p></li>
<li><p class="">For example, while assessing a client's plan, a nurse must consider all symptoms, analyze his/her interpretation of the source, analyze the relevance of the pain to the client's clinical situation, choose interventions, and evaluate the consequences of treatment choices.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Critical thinking is ongoing with information being analyzed from many sources. If one places the nursing process within the context of the critical thinking model, one is able to see two processes occurring together.</p></li>
<li><p class="">As the nurse engages in nursing process for the care of a client, he/she is also synthesizing critical thinking knowledge, experience, standards and attitudes.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The nurse who is assessing a client's pain does not focus only on what the client reports about the pain and what the nurse is able to observe and measure. The nurse also reflects on prior experience with clients who have had similar.</p></li>

<p class="noindent">The person applying critical thinking works to develop the following attitudes and characteristics independence of thought, fairness, insight into the personal and public level, humble intellect and postpone the crisis, spiritual courage, integrity, perseverance, self-confidence, research interest considerations not only behind the feelings and emotions but also behind the thoughts and curiosity.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Independence of thought:</bold> Individuals who apply critical thinking as they mature acquire knowledge and experiences and examine their beliefs under new evidence. The nurses do not remain to what they were taught in school, but are “open-minded” in terms of different intervention methods technical skills.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Impartiality:</bold> Those who apply critical thinking are independent in different ways, based on evidence and not panic or personal and group biases. The nurse takes into account the views of both the younger and older family members.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Perspicacity into personal and social factors:</bold> Those who are using critical thinking and accept the possibility that their personal prejudices, social pressures and habits could affect their judgment greatly. So, they try to actively interpret their prejudices whenever they think and decide.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Humble cerebration and deferral crisis:</bold> Humble intellect means to have someone aware of the limits of his own knowledge. So, those who apply critical thinking are willing to admit they do not know something and believe that what we all consider rectum cannot always be true, because new evidence may emerge.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Spiritual courage:</bold> The values and beliefs are not always obtained by rationality, meaning opinions that have been researched and proven that are supported by reasons and information. The courage should be true to their new ground in situations where social penalties for incompatibility are strict. In many cases, the nurses who supported an attitude according to which if investigations are proved wrong, they are canceled.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Integrity:</bold> Use of critical thinking to mentally intact individuals question their knowledge and beliefs quickly and thoroughly and cause the knowledge of others so that they are willing to admit and appreciate inconsistencies of both their own beliefs and the beliefs of the others.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Perseverance:</bold> The perseverance shown by nurses in exploring effective solutions for patient problems and nursing each determination helps to clarify concepts and to distinguish-related issues despite the difficulties and failures. Using critical thinking they resist the temptation to find a quick and simple answer to avoid uncomfortable situations, such as confusion and frustration.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Confidence in the justification:</bold> According to critical thinking through well motivated reasoning leads to reliable conclusions. Using critical thinking nurses develop both the inductive and the deductive reasoning. The nurse gaining more experience of mental process and improvement, does not hesitate to disagree and be troubled thereby acting as a role model to colleagues, inspiring them to develop critical thinking.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Interesting thoughts and feelings for research:</bold> Nurses need to recognize, examine and inspect or modify the emotions involved with critical thinking. So, if they feel anger, guilt and frustration for some event in their work, they should follow some steps: To restrict the operations for a while to avoid hasty conclusions and impulsive decisions, discuss negative feelings with a trusted, consume some of the energy produced by emotion, for example, doing calisthenics or walking, ponder over the situation and determine whether the emotional response is appropriate. After intense feelings abate, the nurse will be able to proceed objectively to necessary conclusions and to take the necessary decisions.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Curiosity:</bold> The internal debate, that has constantly in mind that the use of critical thinking is full of questions. So, a research nurse calculates traditions but does not hesitate to challenge them if you do not confirm their validity and reliability.</p></li>

<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Confidence:</bold> Learn how to introduce yourself to a client. Speak with conviction when you being a treatment or procedure. Do not lead a client to think that you are certain of being able to perform care safely. Always be prepared before performing a nursing activity.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Thinking independently:</bold> Read the nursing literature, especially when there are different views on the same subject. Talk with colleagues and share ideas about nursing interventions. <bold><a href="#ch2fig8" class="ulink-inter">Figure 2.8</a></bold> shows process of critical thinking and its application in nursing.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Fairness:</bold> Listen to both sides in any discussion. If a client or family member complains about a colleague, listen to the story and then speak with the colleague as well. Weigh all facts.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Responsibility and authority:</bold> Ask for help if you are uncertain about an aspect of client care. Report any problems immediately. Follow standards of practice in your care.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Risk taking:</bold> If your knowledge causes you to question a physician's order, do so. Be willing to recommend alternative approaches to nursing care when colleagues are having little successes with clients.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Discipline:</bold> Be thorough in whatever you do. Use known scientific and practice-based criteria for activities, such as assessment and evaluation.

<p class="noindent">Critical thinking involves the use of a group of interconnected skills to analyze, creatively integrate, and evaluate what you read and hear. To become a critical thinker you must be able to decide whether an author's opinions are true or false, whether he/she has adequately defended those ideas, whether certain recommendations are practical, as well as whether particular solutions will be effective. Critical thinking involves the use of a kind of thinking called reasoning, in which we construct and/or evaluate reasons to support beliefs.<a name="page60"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">60</span></span> Critical thinking also involves reflection—the examination and evaluation of our own and others’ thoughts and ideas. Finally critical thinking is practical. Actions are more rational if they are based on beliefs that we take to be justified. Critical thinking then, is the careful, deliberate determination of whether we should accept, reject or suspend judgment about the truth of a claim or a recommendation to act in a certain way.</p>
<p class="noindent"><bold>Step 1—Knowledge:</bold> In terms of critical thinking, the basic level of acquisition of knowledge requires that you be able to identify what is being said<bold>—</bold>the topic, the issue, the thesis, and the main points.</p>
<p class="noindent"><bold>Step 2—Comprehension:</bold> Comprehension means understanding the material read, heard or seen. In comprehending, you make the new knowledge that you have acquired your own by relating it to what you already know. The better you are involved with the information, the better you will comprehend it. As always, the primary test of whether you have comprehended something is whether you can put what you have read or heard into your own words.</p>
<p class="noindent"><bold>Step 3—Application:</bold> Application requires that you know what you have read, heard, or seen, that you comprehend it, and that you carry out some task to apply what you comprehend to an actual situation.</p>
<p class="noindent"><bold>Step 4—Analysis:</bold> Analysis involves breaking what you read or hear into its component parts, in order to make clear how the ideas are ordered, related, or connected to other ideas. Analysis deals with both form and content.</p>
<p class="noindent"><bold>Step 5—Synthesis:</bold> Synthesis involves the ability to put together the parts you analyzed with other information to create something original.</p>
<p class="noindent"><bold>Step 6—Evaluation:</bold> Evaluation occurs once we have understood and analyzed what is said or written and the reasons offered to support it. Then we can appraise this information in order to decide whether you can give or withhold belief, and whether or not to take a particular action.</p>

<p class="noindent">Concept mapping is a technique that uses a graphic depiction of nonlinear and linear relationships to represent critical thinking. Also known as mind mapping, concept maps are context dependent and can be used to develop analytical skills. The attributes of the concept are linked, making meaning of the concept they represent. Concept maps provide an opportunity to visualize things in your own way.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch2lev2sec8"><h2 class="title">Definition</h2>
<p class="noindent">A concept map is a special form of a web diagram for exploring knowledge and gathering and sharing information. Concept mapping is the strategy employed in developing a concept map. This is a visual depiction of concepts, ideas, theories, or questions. Concept maps can show existent or new relations. They are aids to processing information, storing or retrieving information, and solving problems.</p>

The scientific nursing activities and responsibilities are associated with each steps of the nursing process:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p class=""><bold>Assessment:</bold> It is collecting, verifying and organizing data about the client health status. Data about physical, emotional, developmental, social, cultural, intellectual and spiritual aspects of the client's are obtained from a variety of sources and are the basis for actions and decisions taken at a subsequent phases.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Nursing diagnosis:</bold> It is a process of making a clinical judgment about a client's potential or actual health problem. Nursing diagnosis is the statement of the judgment. In this phase, the nurse sorts, clusters the data and analyzes, what are the actual and potential health problems for which the client needs nursing assistance and what may be the contributing factors to this problem?</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Planning:</bold> It involves a series of steps in which the nurse and client set priorities, formulate goals or expected outcomes and establish a written care plan for nursing interventions. The plan to resolve or minimize the identified problems of the client and to coordinate the care provided by all the health team members.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Implementation:</bold> It is putting the nursing care plan into action. During the implementation phase, the nurse continues to collect data and carries out the prescribed nursing activities or delegates the care to an appropriate person who validates the nursing care plan.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Evaluation:</bold> It is assessing the client's response to nursing interventions and then comparing the response to predetermined standards. These standards are often referred to as ‘outcome criteria’. The nurse determines the extent to which the goals are predetermined and the outcomes of care that have been achieved, partially achieved or not met.</p></li>

<p class="noindent">The clinical skills utilized for assessment include observation, interviewing, physical examination and intuition. Assessment involves recognizing and collecting cues. Cues are pieces of information about a client's health status and can be overt or covert. The clinical skills utilized for assessment include the following:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Observation</bold> is not just seen the client, but also the use of smell, hearing and touch.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Interviewing</bold> means interaction with the client and communication, so as to gather data by questioning or information exchange.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Physical examination</bold> is a systematic method of collection of data, using the senses of sight, hearing, smell and touch to detect health problems. The various techniques used are inspection, palpation, percussion and auscultation.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Intuition</bold> is defined as the use of insight, instinct and clinical experience to make a clinical judgment about the client.</p></li>

<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Assessment involves more mostly five activities, i.e., data collection from a variety of sources, data validation, data organization, data interpretation, data documentation.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Collection of data is a process of compiling information about the client. Both subjective and objective data are collected.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Subjective data or symptoms or covert cues are the client's feelings and statements about his/her health problems.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Objective data or signs or overt cues are observable, perceptible and measurable data.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Sources of data</bold>: There are two important sources of data collection. Primary source is the client himself and secondary source includes family members or significant others, health source include family members or significant others, health record, laboratory tests and diagnostic procedures, health team members and literature review.</p></li>

<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Beliefs:</bold> The nurse's belief encompasses a caring philosophy about the client's, responsibilities and health and illness and the role of nursing in health care. These philosophies do not blossom overnight but are molded during the course of nursing education by nurses, other students, instructors and clients.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Knowledge:</bold> The knowledge base for nurses is extensive and nurses are required to use information from sciences, such as nursing, anatomy, physiology, microbiology, pharmacology, chemistry and nutrition using all of these sciences is guidelines, the nurse can analyze data collected about the client.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Skill:</bold> A variety of skills are required to perform a complete assessment of the client. They include psychomotor and interpersonal.</p>
<p class="indent">Psychomotor skills are the technical skills required in many phases and nursing process. During the assessment phase, the most common skills are those of physical assessment, such as inspection, palpation and auscultation.</p><p class=""><div class="figure" id="ch2fig17" data-label="Fig. 2.17"><div class="title"><span class="item-label">Fig. 2.17</span> Nursing process: Assessment—data collection.</div><img alt="Fig. 2.17" src="/MediumImage/68-1.jpg"><div class="additional-markup"></div></div><a name="page69"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">69</span></span></p></li>

<p class="noindent">Data collected from a patient includes both objective and subjective data. Objective data are detectable by an observer. Examples of objective data are blood pressure recording, checking body temperature, detecting cyanosis in a patient. Subjective data are apparent only to the patient concerned. Examples of subjective data are feeling of pain, inching, etc.</p>
<p class="indent">Data collection is an important task in the assessment. Nurses collect data, cluster cues, make inferences and identify emerging patterns and potential problem areas.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch2lev3sec10"><h3 class="title">Types of Data</h3>
<p class="noindent">Mainly two types of data collected in the assessment. Those are subjective data and objective data.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p class=""><bold>Subjective data:</bold> Only the patient provides subjective data about their health problems. It usually includes feelings, perceptions and self-reports of symptoms.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Objective data:</bold> Objective data around generation or measurement of a patient's health status. For example, inspecting the condition of a surgical incision or on, describing an object behavior and measuring blood pressure.</p></li>

The patient who is conscious alert and able to answer questions correctly provide the most accurate information about their healthcare needs, lifestyle patterns, present and past illness, perception of symptoms, responses to treatment, and changes in activities of daily living. A patient we tag acute symptoms in an emergency department will not give accurate information as compared to a patient in the outpatient department.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Family and significant others:</bold> Family members are the primary source of information for infants or children; critically-ill adults; and patients who are mentally handicapped, disoriented, or conscious. Family members are the only source of information in case of severe illness or emergency situations. They confirm the findings that a patient provides. The patient always does not want to involve family members and friends so nurses must take the patients consent before involving family members. Otherwise, the family member can be interviewed separately.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Healthcare team:</bold> Nurses can also get information from healthcare teams, it can be done during bedside rounds, and nurse to completing care of a shift, the patient and the nurse assuming care for shift-share information about the patient's condition, the status of problems and plan of care. When nurses, physicians, physical therapists, social workers, or other staff consult on a patient's condition, they share information about how the patient is interacting within the healthcare environment, the patient's reactions to treatment, and the result of diagnostic procedures or therapies. Every member of the team is a source of information for identifying and verifying information about the patient.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Medical records:</bold> Medical record is a source for patient's medical history laboratory and diagnostic test results, current physical findings, and the primary healthcare provider's treatment plan. The record is a valuable tool for checking the consistency and similarities of personal observations. Data in the records offer a baseline and I am going information about the patient's response to illness and progress to date. Information in patient's record is confidential so organizational rules must be followed.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Nurses experience:</bold> Through clinical experience in north observers other patients, recognizes clinical changes, and learns the types of questions to ask, choosing only the questions that will give the most useful information and nurses expertise develops after tasting and defining inferences, questions and principles or standards-based expectations.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Other records and reports:</bold> Other records and reports can also provide information pertinent to health, laboratory, and tests are frequently ordered as part of the physician's initial examination to aid in a medical diagnosis.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Literature:</bold> The review of nursing and related literature, such as professional journals and reference texts, can provide additional information for the database.</p></li>

<div class="section" id="ch2lev4sec6"><h4 class="title">Collecting Health History</h4>
<p class="noindent">A nursing history usually contains basic information's, such as following:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Biographical information:</bold> Biographical information is factual demographic data about the patient. The patient's age, address, occupation and working status, marital status, sources of healthcare, and types of insurance are included. Admitting office staff usually collects this information.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Present illness:</bold> If a patient presents with an illness, collect essential and relevant data about the symptoms and their effects on the patient's health. While collecting information about the patient symptoms, nurses should collect information regarding location, onset activation, reciprocating factors, relieving factors, quality and severity.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Past health history:</bold> The information in past health history includes a past medical history and past surgical history. Nurses should assess the patient has ever been hospitalized, injured or had surgery. It included complete medication history and also an essential description of allergies, including allergy reaction to food, latex, drugs or contact agents.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Health history:</bold> The information in a patient's health history provides the data on patient's healthcare experiences and current health habits and lifestyle patterns. Assessing for the use of alcohol, tobacco, caffeine, or recreational drugs determined the patient's risks for the disease involving the liver, lungs, heart or nervous system. Assessing the pattern of sleep, exercise, nutrition is also important when planning nursing care.<a name="page71"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">71</span></span></p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Family history:</bold> The family history obtains data about immediate and blood relatives. The objectives are to determine whether the patients at risk for illness of a genetic or familial in nature and to identify areas of health promotion and illness prevention. Family history also provides information about family structure, interaction, support and function that is often is useful in planning care. For example, if patients family member is not supportive, its better not to involve them in care.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Environmental history:</bold> Environmental history provides data about the patient's home and working environments with a focus on determining the patients and safety. Information about the home environment includes the function of utilities, the layout of the rooms in the house, and the presence of any barriers that are risks of injury. History also identifies exposure to pollutants in the workplace, the distance of a crime in the patient's neighborhood, and available resources that assist the patient in returning to the community.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Psychosocial history</bold>: A psychosocial history reveals the patient support system, which often includes spouse, children, other family members, and close friends. The history includes information about ways that so patient and family typically cope with stress. Behaviors patient use at home to cope with stress, such as walking, reading or talking with a friend, can also be used Raj nursing intervention if the patient experiences stress while receiving healthcare.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Spiritual health:</bold> Life experiences and events say papers and spirituality. The spiritual dimension represents the totality of one's being and is difficult to assess quickly. Review with patients their beliefs about life, their source of guidance in acting on belief, and the relationship, they have with the family in exercising their faith. Also assess rituals and religious practices that patients used to express their spirituality. <bold><a href="#ch2fig19" class="ulink-inter">Figure 2.19</a></bold> illustrates the process in taking patients’ health history.</p></li>

<p class="noindent">The act of “double-checking” or verifying data to confirm that it is accurate and complete</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Validation is comparing data with another source to check its accuracy. Meditation opens the door to gathering more assessment data because it involves clarifying vague or unclear data.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Occasionally nurses need to reassess previously covered areas of nursing history or gather further physical examination data.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Continually analyze and think about a patient's database to make concise, accurate and meaningful interpretations.</p></li>
<li><p class="">For example, “nurses say that a patient who has been scheduled for surgery looks anxious, so the nurse asks the question,” you look tensed and anxious whether you are uncertain about your surgery result?” Here the patient will explain the causes of his anxiety, this is the validation process.</p></li>

<li><p class="">Differentiate cues and inferences</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent"><bold>Cues:</bold> Subjective or objective data observed by the nurse; it is what the client says, or what the nurse can see, hear, feel, smell or measure.</p>
<p class="noindent"><bold>Inferences:</bold> The nurse interpretation or conclusion based on the cues.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Example:</span></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">

<div class="section" id="ch2lev3sec13"><h3 class="title">Data Organization</h3>
<p class="noindent">Collected data must be organized so as to be useful to the healthcare professional collecting the data and to others involved in the clients care. After being organized into categories, the data clustered into groups of related pieces. Data clustering is the process of putting data together in order to identify areas of the client's problems and strengths. Many healthcare agencies use an admission assessment format, which assists the nurse in collecting and organizing data.</p>
<p class="noindent">Data can be organized in following ways:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Hierarchy of needs:</bold> Maslow's hierarchy of needs proposes that an individual's basic needs must be met before higher-level needs can be met. An initial assessment of all psychological needs followed by an assessment of higher-level need is necessary when using this model.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Body systems model:</bold> The body systems model organizes data collection according to tissue and organ function in the various body systems. Physicians frequently use this model, so it is sometimes called the “medical model”.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Functional health patterns:</bold> Gordon's functional health part patterns provides a framework for data collection focusing on 11 functional health problems. These functional health patterns areas cluster information about the client's habitual patterns and any recent changes to determine if the client's current response is functional or dysfunctional. These 11 patterns are:
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p class="">Health perception/health management pattern</p></li>
<li><p class="">Nutritional/metabolic pattern</p></li>
<li><p class="">Elimination pattern</p></li>
<li><p class="">Activity/exercise pattern</p></li>
<li><p class="">Cognitive/perceptual pattern</p></li>
<li><p class="">Seep/rest pattern</p></li>
<li><p class="">Self-perception/self-concept pattern role/relationship pattern</p></li>
<li><p class="">Sexuality/reproductive pattern</p></li>
<li><p class="">Coping/stress tolerance pattern</p></li>
<li><p class="">Values/belief pattern</p></li>
<li><p class="">Theory of self-care: Ward in 2001 developed the theory of self-care based on the client's ability to 4 per self-care activities. Self-care, law and behavior with deliberate actions responding to need, includes activities and individual performs to maintain health. This theory focuses on the assessment of clients ability to meet self-care needs and identifying existing self-care deficit. This theory is concerned primarily with illness states.</p></li></ol></p></li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent"><bold>The self-care essentials are:</bold></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Maintenance of a sufficient intake of air</p></li>
<li><p class="">Maintenance of his sufficient intake of water</p></li>
<li><p class="">Maintenance sufficient and intake of food</p></li>
<li><p class="">Provision of care associated with the elimination processes and excrements</p></li>
<li><p class="">The balance between activity and rest</p></li>
<li><p class="">A balance between solitude and social interaction</p></li>
<li><p class="">Prevention of hazards to human life, human functioning, and human well-being</p></li>
<li><p class="">Promotion of human functioning and development with social groups in accord with human potential, known human limitations, and human desire to be normal.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch2lev3sec14"><h3 class="title">Interpreting the Data</h3>
<p class="noindent">After the data is collected, the nurse can begin developing impressions or inferences about the meaning of the data. Organizing data in clusters helps the nurse recognize patterns of response or behavior. When data are placed in clusters, and the nurse can:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Distinguish between relevant and irrelevant data.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Determine whether and where there are gaps in the data.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Identify patterns of cause and effect.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch2lev3sec15"><h3 class="title">Data Documentation</h3>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Data documentation is the last part of a complete assessment. The timely, thorough, and accurate documentation of facts is required in recording patient data.</p></li>
<li><p class="">If you do not record an assessment finding or problem interpretation, it is lost and unavailable to anyone else caring for the patient. If information is not specific, the reader is left with only general impressions.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Observing and recording patient status is legal and professional responsibilities.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The basic rule is to record all observations succinctly. When recording data, pay attention to facts and be as descriptive as possible.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Anything heard, seen, felt, or smelled should be reported exactly. Record objective information in accurate terminology (e.g., weighs 170 kg, the abdomen is soft and non-tender to palpation). Record subjective information from a patient in quotation marks.<a name="page73"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">73</span></span></p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch2lev3sec16"><h3 class="title">Methods of Data Collection</h3>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Observation:</bold> The nurse observes mainly through sight, all of the senses are engaged during careful observations. Observation has two aspects—(a) noticing the stimuli and (b) selecting organizing and interpreting the data, i.e., perceiving them. Observation is a conscious, deliberate skill that is developed only through effort and with an organized approach.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Interviewing:</bold> The nurse interviews the patient and his significant others obtain data by asking relevant questions. Interview is a planned communication or conversation with a purpose. Interviewing can be viewed as a process in the nursing health history, which is the primary tool for data collection during the assessment phase of the nursing process.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Examination:</bold> Nurses perform physical assessment to obtain the objective data needed to complete the assessment phase of the nursing process. A complete database of both subjective and objective data allows the nurse to formulate nursing diagnosis, to develop client goals and intervene to promote health and prevent disease.</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="ch2lev4sec8"><h4 class="title">Guideline for Data Collection</h4>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Initial history:</bold> The data collected in this step usually include the historical data (pat illness), current data (the current complaint) and demographic data (date of birth, address). It is helpful to address the client's chief complaint early in the interview process.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Symptom analysis:</bold> When a client expresses a problem the nurse conducts a complete analysis of a symptom. This process begins with symptoms analysis which is the collection of subjective data about the problem. Symptoms analysis requires the client to identify the location of the symptoms, describe the symptoms, severity of the pain, and timing of the symptoms (including onset, duration and frequency). Aggravating and relieving symptoms and any associated symptoms. It is crucial that the nurse be able to perform a complete symptoms analysis. The data obtained can guide the nurse in detecting what the problem is and what degree of priority is should be given.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Approaches to history taking:</bold> There are various approaches that can be used to provide a systematic guide to assessment. Gordon has devised functional health patterns and the North American Nursing Diagnosis Association (NANDA) has devised human response patterns-based on patterns of unitary persons.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Physical examination:</bold> Physical examination of the client is the second portion of assessment. Examination allows the nurse to gain objective data through the use of inspection, percussion, palpation and auscultation. These data further define the client's response to the disorder, provide a baseline of data for further comparison, and elaborate on the subjective data provided in the client's history.</p></li>

<div class="section" id="ch2lev3sec22"><h3 class="title">Identification of Client Problems, Risks and Strengths</h3>
<p class="noindent">In the diagnosis phase, the nurse follows a set of objectives that end with developing the nursing diagnosis/diagnoses used to establish patient care. These are the main objectives of the diagnosis phase:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p class=""><bold>Identify and define the problem(s):</bold> The nurse must identify what problem the patient is experiencing related to the medical diagnosis.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Identify risk factors:</bold> Any situation or problem that could result because of the patient's medical diagnosis is a risk factor for a nursing diagnosis and must be addressed.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Analyze data:</bold> All data gathered during the assessment phase of the nursing process must be compiled, validated, and analyzed to support an appropriate nursing diagnosis.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Develop a theory/hypothesis:</bold> Nursing theories involve an organized framework of concepts and purposes that guide nursing practices. A nurse's theory is their unique perspective about the patient's status and measures needed to improve the patient's outcome.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Establish a nursing diagnosis:</bold> After identifying problems and risk factors, analyzing data, and developing a nursing theory, the nurse can then establish a nursing diagnosis or diagnoses which are used to establish a nursing care plan.</p></li>

<li><p class=""><bold>Actual diagnosis:</bold> A clinical judgment about human experience/responses to health conditions/life processes that exist in an individual, family, or community”. An example of an actual nursing diagnosis is: Sleep deprivation. An actual diagnosis is a statement about a health problem that the client has, and could benefit from nursing care. An example of an actual nursing diagnosis is: Ineffective airway clearance related to decreased energy and manifested by an ineffective cough.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Risk diagnosis:</bold> Describes human responses to health conditions/life processes that may develop in a vulnerable individual/family/community. It is supported by risk factors that contribute to increased vulnerability. An example of a risk diagnosis is—risk for shock. A risk diagnosis is a statement about a health problem that the client does not have yet, but is at a higher than normal risk of developing in the near future. An example of a risk diagnosis is—risk for injury related to altered mobility and disorientation.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Health promotion diagnosis:</bold> A clinical judgment about a person's, family's or community's motivation and desire to increase wellbeing and actualize human health potential as expressed in the readiness to enhance specific health behaviors, and can be used in any health state. An example of a health promotion diagnosis is—readiness for enhanced nutrition’.’</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Syndrome diagnosis:</bold> A clinical judgment describing a specific cluster of nursing diagnoses that occur together, and are best addressed together and through similar interventions.” An example of a syndrome diagnosis is—relocation stress syndrome A syndrome diagnosis is used when a cluster of nursing diagnoses are often seen together. An example of a syndrome diagnosis is—Rape Trauma syndrome related to anxiety about potential health problems and as manifested by anger, genitourinary discomfort, and sleep pattern disturbance.</p></li>

<p class="noindent">A nursing diagnosis encompasses Maslow's Hierarchy of needs and helps to prioritize and plan care based on patient-centered outcomes. In 1943, Abraham Maslow developed a hierarchy based on basic fundamental needs innate for all individuals.<a name="page77"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">77</span></span> Basic physiological needs/goals must be met before higher needs/goals can be achieved, such as self-esteem and self-actualization. Physiological and safety needs provide the basis for the implementation of nursing care and nursing interventions. Thus, they are at the base of Maslow's pyramid, laying the foundation for physical and emotional health.</p>

<li><p class=""><bold>Validation:</bold> The next step of data analysis is validation. In this step, the nurse verifies the diagnosis by speaking to the client. The nurse can validate finding with the family, especially if the client is unable to communicate. For example, the nurse could ask about scars or wounds and therefore, expand the data base on the client. The nurse can also validate the diagnosis by comparing it to textbook material or by talking to other nurses.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Inductive versus deductive reasoning:</bold> The nurse may use inductive or deductive reasoning to interpret data. Inductive reasoning begins with a set of facts from which a conclusion is drawn. Inductive reasoning is the use of cues to draw a conclusion. Deductive reasoning begins with the facts that the client is on bed rest and taking narcotics and concludes (deduces) that the client is at an increased risk.</p></li>

<li><p class="">These nursing diagnosis and their treatment are within the legal scope of nursing practice. The actual conditions that nurses are educated to handle and licensed to treat are called nursing diagnosis.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The role of the nurses can vary greatly between settings; there has always been difficulty in describing the work in nursing. NANDA has provided national leadership in the development of standardized statements or nursing diagnosis, to describe human response to actual or potential health problems which nurses treat.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch2lev3sec31"><h3 class="title">Writing a Nursing Diagnosis</h3>
<p class="noindent">A nursing diagnosis should be written in three parts indicating the human response, related factors and defining characteristics.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p class=""><bold>Human response:</bold> The human response is the client's problem attached as a nursing diagnosis. Most nurses use NANDA nursing diagnosis as the human response statement, but other form of problem statements are possible. The human response should always be stated as a response to care rather than as a need for care. Needs for care, such as needs to be fed or needs to be turned every two hours, describe a nursing intervention rather than a client problem.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Related factors:</bold> The related factors are the possible causes or etiology of the problem. This section of the statement describes the factors associated with the problem. These factors may be environmental, psychological, physiological, sociocultural or spiritual. Because these factors direct nursing actions aimed at resolving, preventing or reducing the problem, the related factor should be directed at an aspect of the client response on which the nurse have an impact.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The defining characteristics are the data indicating the problem is present. When the client is at risk of developing a problem, the risk factors are identified rather than defining characteristics.</p></li>
</ol>
<div class="section" id="ch2lev4sec14"><h4 class="title">Ten Rules for Writing a Nursing Diagnosis</h4>
<p class="noindent">Prioritizing the nursing diagnoses involves deciding which diagnoses are the most important and require attention first. Maslow's hierarchy of needs is one of the most common methods of selecting priorities. After basic physiological needs (e.g., respiration, nutrition, temperature, hydration, and elimination) are met to some degree, the nurse can then consider needs on the next level of the hierarchy (e.g., safe environment, stable living condition, affection, and self-worth) and so on up the hierarchy until all the nursing diagnoses have been prioritized.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p class="">Write the diagnosis in terms of the client's response rather than nursing need.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Use “related to “rather than “due to “or “caused by” to connect the first two parts of the statement.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Write the diagnosis in legally advisable terms.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Write the diagnosis without value judgments.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Avoid reversing the parts of the statement.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Avoid using single cues as the first part of the statement.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The two parts of the statement should not mean the same thing.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Express the related factor in terms that can be changed.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Do not include the medical diagnosis in the nursing diagnosis.</p></li>

<div class="section" id="ch2lev2sec35"><h2 class="title">Nursing Diagnosis</h2>
<p class="noindent">A nursing diagnosis is a statement that describes a suspected problem that requires additional data to confirm or rule out the suspected problem. A nursing diagnosis provides the nurse the ability to communicate with the other nurses through the diagnosis.</p>

<p class="noindent">The next step in the nursing process is planning activities to promote healthy client responses or prevent, correct or reduce unhealthy client responses. Planning and setting expected outcomes begins by determining the priority of human response.</p>
<p class="indent">The planning stage is where goals and outcomes are formulated that directly impact patient care based. These patient-specific goals and the attainment of such assist in ensuring a positive outcome. Nursing care plans are essential in this phase of goal setting. Care plans provide a course of direction for personalized care tailored to an individual's unique needs. Overall condition and comorbid conditions play a role in the construction of a care plan. Care plans enhance communication, documentation, reimbursement, and continuity of care across the healthcare continuum.</p>

<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Ideally the accomplishment of all aspects of the planning phase of the nursing process is a group effort.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The nurse collaborates with other members of the nursing team, with the patient and his family and with appropriate resource persons from the healthcare agency and community agencies.</p></li>

<li><p class="">Consider something that is very important to the client.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Actual problems take precedence over potential concerns.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Clients with unstable condition should be given priority over those with stable conditions. Example—attend to client with fever before attending to client who is scheduled for physical therapy in the afternoon.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Consider the amount of time, materials, equipment required to care for clients. Example—attend to client who requires dressing change for postoperative wound before attending to client who requires health teachings and is ready to be discharged late in the afternoon.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Attend to client before equipment. Example—assess the client before checking IV fluids, urinary catheter, and drainage tube.</p></li>

<div class="section" id="ch2lev2sec42"><h2 class="title">Nursing Implementation</h2>
<p class="noindent">Nursing intervention is a nursing action. This action may be treatment, any diagnostic or therapeutic procedure or nursing activity. Nurse is performing an action to achieve outcome for a medical or nursing diagnosis to which nurse is accountable. Nursing interventions are the actual implementation of the care plan. Nursing interventions are designed to promote, maintain or restore the client's health.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">This is the action phase of the nursing process. It is the actual initiation of the plan and documenting of nursing actions.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Implementing is mean to carry out, to perform, to intervene or to do something.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The nursing activities may be carried out by one nurse or it may be delegated to a group of nurses.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Interventions can be independent intervention, i.e., the nurse is licensed to carry out independent or dependent interventions, i.e., those that are carried out under the guidance/order of a physician.</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="ch2lev3sec37"><h3 class="title">Definitions</h3>

<p class="indent">As the client's conditions changes, priorities also change. Nursing interventions must be carried out based on the priority needs.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch2lev3sec41"><h3 class="title">Skills Required for Nurse in Implementation</h3>
<p class="noindent">In implementation phase of nurse process, nurse need to be competent in cognitive, interpersonal, technical and psychomotor skill.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Cognitive skills:</bold> Cognitive skills involve application of nursing knowledge to anticipate and identify client's needs. Cognitive skills include problem solving, decision making and teaching. In order to enhance client's decision making ability, nurse gives him multiple choices to select choices to select which treatments are performed and in which sequence.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Interpersonal:</bold> This is the ability to work with others to achieve a goal. As nurse is considered as backbone of the hospital, she must have knowledge and skill of developing and maintaining interpersonal and intrapersonal relations. Nurse uses communication skill to carry out planned nursing interventions.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Psychomotor skill:</bold> It requires the integration of cognitive and motor activities. For giving intramuscular injection, nurse need to have knowledge of anatomy and physiology of body as well as preparing and administering injection such skill are important while doing dressing wounds, giving injection, suctioning and tracheotomy care.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Technical skills:</bold> It is the skill needed to use equipment, machine, supplies in a particular specialty. Example: equipment, such as ventilation, phototherapy machine, suctioning machine, infusion pump, etc.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent"><bold><a href="#ch2fig24" class="ulink-inter">Figure 2.24</a></bold> depicts the nursing process—implementation.</p>
<p class="noindent"><bold>Nursing implementations have following seven characteristics:</bold></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p class="">Be congruent with the overall plan of care.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Be based on scientific principles.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Be individualized to the client.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Be designed to provide a safe and therapeutic environment.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Consider the need for teaching and learning.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Use resources appropriately.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Be clearly communicated.</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="noindent"><bold>Providing self-care:</bold> The nurse should identify what skills are required for providing the intervention. It is important to remember that when a skill is delegated to another healthcare team member, the registered nurse remains legally responsible for the client's outcome. Another aspect of providing self-care is continuous monitoring for complication. There are many complications that can allow surgery, medication administration and disease states. While the care is being given, the nurse continues to assess the client and evaluate his/her response to the care. The nurse also needs to consider which of the interventions could be modified, if the client shows no progress toward the desired outcome.</p>
<p class="noindent"><bold>Nursing roles:</bold> Providing care teller into seven categories, according to Benner. Helper role, teaching coaching, diagnostic and patient monitoring, management of rapidly changing conditions, administering and monitoring therapeutic regimens, monitoring and ensuring quality of healthcare practices and organizational and work role competencies.</p>
<p class="noindent"><bold>Rationale:</bold> At times, the scientific rationale for an intervention is required on a student care plan or listed within a standardized plan of care. It is important that the care given has its basis in scientific study, not in habit or old wives tales. The use of rationale assists in identifying the professional nurse from other providers of health care.</p>

<div class="section" id="ch2lev3sec42"><h3 class="title">Nursing Interventions Classification System</h3>
<p class="noindent">There are several types of nursing interventions aimed at meeting the variety of medical needs and conditions of patients. The Nursing Interventions Classification (NIC) system categorizes a wide range of possible treatments that a nurse may perform.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Family nursing interventions:</bold> Family nursing interventions are those that address not only the patient, but other family members as well. They could entail education of family members about caring for the patient; or, in the case of new mothers, interventions could consist of instruction and assistance with breastfeeding and other forms of infant care.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Behavioral nursing interventions:</bold> This category includes actions a nurse takes to help their patient change an unhealthful behavior or habit; for example, suggesting physical and emotional coping methods for a patient who wants to quit smoking.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Physiological nursing interventions (basic):</bold> Basic interventions concerning the patient's physical health include hands-on procedures ranging from feeding to hygiene assistance.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Physiological nursing interventions (complex):</bold> Some physiological nursing interventions are more complex, such as the insertion of an IV line to administer fluids to a dehydrated patient.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Community nursing interventions:</bold> Some hospitals and clinics focus on public health initiatives to educate patients, their families, and local communities. These community nursing interventions are organized efforts that encourage general health and wellness. For example, many clinics and pharmacies are currently administering the COVID-19 vaccine, or a hospital may offer a free education program about diabetes or organize a fun run to raise money for breast cancer research.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Safety nursing interventions:</bold> After undergoing surgery, patients need education on safety procedures and protocols to prevent injury. These safety interventions may include instructions for using a walker or a cane or how to take a shower safely.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Health system interventions:</bold> During their shift, nurses take the initiative to ensure that the patient's environment is safe and comfortable, such as repositioning them to avoid pressure ulcers in bed. These routine procedures classify as health system interventions. While a nurse may not use every type of intervention every day, each is an essential form of care needed to maintain the patient's physical, emotional, and mental well-being and reach desired outcomes.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch2lev3sec43"><h3 class="title">Key Nursing Interventions to Perform Each Shift</h3>
<p class="noindent">On-duty nurses routinely perform certain nursing interventions as part of their daily tasks. In addition to educating the patient on their care and recovery progression, nurses will typically perform the following each shift:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Pain control:</bold> Ensuring that the patient is comfortable and monitoring their intake of pain medication, if applicable</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Position changes:</bold> Promoting a change of the patient's resting position to prevent bedsores</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Active listening:</bold> Listening to the patient and repeating back information so they feel heard</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Cluster care:</bold> Informing other nurses and care team members of the patient's needs each shift to help consolidate trips and avoid frequent traffic in the patient's room</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Fall prevention:</bold> Educating the patient, generally someone who is elderly or recovering post-surgery, of instructions to avoid the risk of fall and injury</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Adequate oral intake:</bold> Promoting fluid consumption by mouth for patients currently receiving fluid through IVs as a means to decrease and discontinue IV use</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">Creating a safe environment, promoting good health practices, and listening closely to patients are daily nursing interventions you will perform and perfect throughout your career as a nurse.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch2lev2sec43"><h2 class="title">Nursing Evaluation</h2>
<p class="noindent">The last step in the process is evaluation. Evaluation examines the degree of goal attainment and basically asks, “Did the client achieve the goal he/she was supposed to?” and if not why not? Evaluation begins with collecting data about the client's health status, closely reexamining the outcome criteria. The degree of outcome attainment is determined and a revised plan of care is established, if needed.</p>
<p class="indent">The nurse evaluates the progress toward the goals/outcomes identified in the previous phases. If progress towards the goal is slow, or if regression has occurred, the nurse must change the plan of care accordingly. Conversely, if the goal has been achieved then the care can cease. New problems may be identified at this stage, and thus the process will start all over again.<a name="page90"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">90</span></span></p>
<div class="section" id="ch2lev3sec44"><h3 class="title">Definition</h3>
<p class="noindent">Evaluation defined as the judgment of the effectiveness of nursing care to meet client goals, in this phase compares the client is behavioral responses with predetermined client goals and outcome criteria.</p>
<p class="indent"><bold><a href="#ch2fig26" class="ulink-inter">Figure 2.26</a></bold> depicts the evaluation in nursing process.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch2lev3sec45"><h3 class="title">Meaning of Evaluation</h3>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Evaluation, the final step of the nursing process, is crucial to determine whether, after application of the nursing process, the client's condition or well-being improves. The nurse applies all that is known about a client and the client's condition, as well as experience with previous clients, to evaluate whether nursing care was effective. The nurse conducts evaluation measures to determine if expected outcomes are met, not the nursing interventions.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The expected outcomes are the standards against which the nurse judges if goals have been met and thus if care is successful. Providing health care in a timely, competent, and cost-effective manner is complex and challenging. The evaluation process will determine the effectiveness of care, make necessary modifications, and to continuously ensure favorable client outcomes.</p></li>

<li><p class="">Have the patient's nursing needs been met?</p></li>
<li><p class="">Should the nursing interventions be retained, altered or discontinued?</p></li>
<li><p class="">Have new problems evolved for which nursing interventions have not been planned or implemented?</p></li>
<li><p class="">What factors influenced the achievement or lack of achievement of the goals?</p></li>

<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Collecting the data related to the desired outcomes</p></li>
<li><p class="">Comparing the data with outcomes</p></li>
<li><p class="">Relating nursing activities to outcomes</p></li>

</ul>
<div class="section" id="ch2lev4sec24"><h4 class="title">Collecting the Data</h4>
<p class="noindent">The nurse collects the data so that conclusion can be drawn about whether goals have been met. It is usually necessary to collect both subjective and objective data. Data must be recorded concisely and accurately to facilitate the next part of the evaluating process.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch2lev4sec25"><h4 class="title">Comparing the Data with Outcomes</h4>
<p class="noindent">If the first part of the evaluation process has been carried out effectively, it is relatively simple to determine whether a desired outcome has been met. Both the nurse and client play an active role in comparing the client's actual responses with the desired outcomes.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch2lev4sec26"><h4 class="title">Relating Nursing Activities to Outcomes</h4>
<p class="noindent">The third aspect of the evaluating process is determined whether the nursing activities had any relation to the outcome.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch2lev4sec27"><h4 class="title">Drawing Conclusion about Problem Status</h4>
<p class="noindent">The nurse uses the judgment about goal achievement to determine whether the care plan was effective in resolving, reducing or preventing client problems. When goals have been met the nurse can draw one the following conclusions about the status of the client's problem.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">The actual problem stated in the nursing diagnosis has been resolved, or the potential problem is being prevented and the risk factors no longer exist. In these instances, the nurse documents that the goals have been met and discontinues the care for the problem.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The potential problem is being prevented, but the risk factors still present. In this case, the nurse keeps the problem on the care plan.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The actual problem still exists even though some goals are being met. In this case, the nursing interventions must be continued.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch2lev4sec28"><h4 class="title">Continuing, Modifying, or Terminating the Nursing Care Plan</h4>
<p class="noindent">After drawing conclusion about the status of the client's problems, the nurse modifies the care plan as indicated. Whether or not goals were met, a number of decisions need to be made about continuing, modifying or terminating nursing care for each problem.</p>
<p class="indent">Before making individual modification, the nurse must first determine why the plan as a whole was not completely effective. This requires a review of the entire plan.</p>

<p class="noindent">Goals for accountability and quality assurance in nursing are being realized. The American Nurses Association has developed basic standards that provide a general model for nursing practice by which the quality of nursing practice may be evaluated. Record-keeping has been revised to provide a problem-oriented approach to documentation of data. The use of outcome criteria as validations of the nursing process has become an accepted trend. The nursing audit has become an accepted method for comparing results of the actual nursing performance with the established criteria.</p>

<div class="section" id="ch2lev2sec44"><h2 class="title">Nursing Care Plan (<a href="#ch2tbl9" class="ulink-inter">Table 2.9</a>)</h2>
<p class="noindent">A nursing care plan (NCP) is a formal process that includes correctly identifying existing needs, as well as recognizing potential needs or risks. Care plans also provide a means of communication among nurses, their patients, and other healthcare providers to achieve health care outcomes. Without the nursing care planning process, quality and consistency in patient care would be lost.</p>
<p class="indent">Nursing care planning begins when the client is admitted to the agency and is continuously updated throughout in response to client's changes in condition and evaluation of goal achievement. Planning and delivering individualized or patient-centered care is the basis for excellence in nursing practice.<a name="page94"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">94</span></span></p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="ch2lev3sec58"><h3 class="title">Types of Nursing Care Plans</h3>
<p class="noindent">Care plans can be informal or formal—Informal nursing care plan is a strategy of action that exists in the nurse's mind. A formal nursing care plan is a written or computerized guide that organizes information about the client's care. Formal care plans are further subdivided into standardized care plan, and individualized care plan—standardized care plans specify the nursing care for groups of clients with everyday needs. Individualized care plans are tailored to meet the unique needs of a specific client or needs that are not addressed by the standardized care plan.</p>

</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch2lev3sec61"><h3 class="title">Components</h3>
<p class="noindent">A nursing care plan usually includes nursing diagnoses, client problems, expected outcomes, and nursing interventions and rationales. These components are elaborated below:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Client health assessment, medical results, and diagnostic reports. This is the first measure in order to be able to design a care plan. In particular, client assessment is related to the following areas and abilities—physical, emotional, sexual, psychosocial, cultural, spiritual/transpersonal, cognitive, functional, age-related, economic and environmental. Information in this area can be subjective and objective.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Expected client outcomes are outlined. These may be long- and short-term.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Nursing interventions are documented in the care plan.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Rationale for interventions in order to be evidence-based care.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Evaluation:</bold> This documents the outcome of nursing interventions.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch2lev3sec62"><h3 class="title">Care Plan Formats</h3>
<p class="noindent">Nursing care plan formats are usually categorized or organized into four columns—(1) nursing diagnoses, (2) desired outcomes and goals, (3) nursing interventions, and (4) evaluation. Some agencies use a three-column plan wherein goals and evaluation are in the same column. Other agencies have a five-column plan that includes a column for assessment cues.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch2lev3sec63"><h3 class="title">Step 1: Data Collection or Assessment</h3>
<p class="noindent">The first step in writing a nursing care plan is to create a client database using assessment techniques and data collection methods (physical assessment, health history, interview, medical records review, and diagnostic studies). A client database includes all the health information gathered. In this step, the nurse can identify the related or risk factors and defining characteristics that can be used to formulate a nursing diagnosis. Some agencies or nursing schools have their own assessment formats you can use.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch2lev3sec64"><h3 class="title">Step 2: Data Analysis and Organization</h3>
<p class="noindent">Now that you have information about the client's health, analyze, cluster, and organize the data to formulate your nursing diagnosis, priorities, and desired outcomes.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch2lev3sec65"><h3 class="title">Step 3: Formulating Your Nursing Diagnoses</h3>
<p class="noindent"><bold>NANDA nursing diagnoses</bold> are a uniform way of identifying, focusing on, and dealing with specific client needs and responses to actual and high-risk problems. Actual or potential health problems that can be prevented or resolved by independent nursing intervention are termed nursing diagnoses.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch2lev3sec66"><h3 class="title">Step 4: Setting Priorities</h3>
<p class="noindent">Setting priorities is the process of establishing a preferential sequence for address nursing diagnoses and interventions. In this step, the nurse and the client begin planning which nursing diagnosis requires attention first. Diagnoses can be ranked and grouped as to having a high, medium, or low priority. Life-threatening problems should be given high priority.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch2lev3sec67"><h3 class="title">Step 5: Establishing Client Goals and Desired Outcomes</h3>
<p class="noindent">After assigning priorities for your nursing diagnosis, the nurse and the client set goals for each determined priority. Goals or desired outcomes describe what the nurse hopes to achieve by implementing the nursing interventions and are derived from the client's nursing diagnoses. Goals provide direction for planning interventions, serve as criteria for evaluating client progress, enable the client and nurse to determine which problems have been resolved, and help motivate the client and nurse by providing a sense of achievement.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch2lev4sec29"><h4 class="title">Short-term and Long-term Goals</h4>
<p class="noindent">Goals and expected outcomes must be <bold>measurable</bold> and <bold>client-centered.</bold> Goals are constructed by focusing on problem prevention, resolution, and/or rehabilitation. Goals can be <bold>short-term</bold> or <bold>long-term</bold>. In an acute care setting, most goals are short-term since much of the nurse's time is spent on the client's immediate needs. Long-term goals are often used for clients who have chronic health problems or who live at home, in nursing homes, or extended care facilities.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Short-term goal</bold>—a statement distinguishing a shift in behavior that can be completed immediately, usually within a few hours or days.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Long-term goal</bold>—indicates an objective to be completed over a longer period, usually over weeks or months.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent"><bold>Discharge plans</bold>—involves naming long-term goals, therefore promoting continued restorative care and problem resolution through home health, physical therapy, or various other referral sources.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch2lev3sec68"><h3 class="title">Step 6: Selecting Nursing Interventions</h3>
<p class="noindent">Nursing interventions are activities or actions that a nurse performs to achieve client goals. Interventions chosen should focus on eliminating or reducing the etiology of the nursing diagnosis. As for risk nursing diagnoses, interventions should focus on reducing the client's risk factors. In this step, nursing interventions are identified and written during the planning step of the nursing process; however, they are actually performed during the implementation step.<a name="page96"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">96</span></span></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch2lev3sec69"><h3 class="title">Step 7: Providing Rationale</h3>
<p class="noindent">Also known as scientific explanation, are the underlying reasons for which the nursing intervention was chosen for the NCP. Rationales do not appear in regular care plans; they are included to assist nursing students in associating the pathophysiological and psychological principles with the selected nursing intervention.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch2lev3sec70"><h3 class="title">Step 8: Evaluation</h3>
<p class="noindent">Evaluating is a planned, ongoing, purposeful activity in which the client's progress towards the achievement of goals or desired outcomes, and the effectiveness of the NCP. Evaluation is an important aspect of the nursing process because conclusions drawn from this step determine whether the nursing intervention should be terminated, continued, or changed.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch2lev3sec71"><h3 class="title">Step 9: Putting it on Paper</h3>
<p class="noindent">The client's NCP is documented according to hospital policy and becomes part of the client's permanent medical record which may be reviewed by the oncoming nurse. Different nursing programs have different care plan formats, most are designed so that the student systematically proceeds through the interrelated steps of the nursing process, and many use a five-column format.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div><div class="section" id="ch2lev1sec18"><h1 class="title">DOCUMENTATION AND REPORTING IN NURSING PROCESS</h1>
<p class="noindent">Nursing documentation is essential for clinical communication.

</div><div class="section" id="ch2lev1sec19"><h1 class="title">CONCLUSION</h1>
<p class="noindent">The nursing process is a process by which nurses deliver care to individuals, families, and/or communities and is supported by nursing theories. The nursing process was originally an adapted form of problem solving and is classified as a deductive theory. The nursing process is a cyclical and ongoing process that can end at any stage if the problem is solved. The nursing process exists for every problem that the individual/family/community has. The nursing process not only focuses on ways to improve physical needs, but also on social and emotional needs as well.</p>
<p class="indent">Nursing process is a deliberate activity utilized to organize nursing care within which the nurse (agent) assumes the role of provider of care, manager of care and member within the profession to empower the client toward self-care. The components include assessment, diagnosis, planning, implementation and evaluation. The entire process is recorded or documented in an agreed format in the record in order to inform all members of the interdisciplinary team about the contributions of nursing professionals to care, and to direct nurses in the performance, revision and evaluation of that care, as appropriate.</p>
<p class="indent">The nurse evaluates the progress toward the goals/outcomes identified in the previous phases. If progress towards the goal is slow, or if regression has occurred, the nurse must change the plan of care accordingly. Conversely, if the goal has been achieved then the care can cease. New problems may be identified at this stage, and thus the process will start all over again.</p>
<p class="indent">The nursing process is used by nurses every day to help patients improve their health and assist doctors in treating patients. Nursing requires the use of this process day in and day out.<a name="page97"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">97</span></span> The process is based on theories and practices taught in nursing school. It is a form of problem solving. The nursing process is made up of a series of stages that are used to achieve the objective—the health improvement of the patient. The nursing process can stop at any stage as deemed necessary or can repeat as needed. This process is inclusive of physical health as well as the emotional aspects of patient health.</p>
