</div><div class="section" id="ch12lev1sec2"><h1 class="title">INTRODUCTION</h1>
<p class="noindent">Self-concept is the image or the idea we have about ourselves. It can be thought of as our perception of our abilities, behaviors and characteristics. It helps us draw a mental picture of who we are—physically, socially and emotionally <bold>(<a href="#ch12fig1" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 12.1</a>)</bold>. We form and develop our self-concept over time.<a name="page508"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">508</span></span> It's shaped and influenced by our knowledge and interactions with our immediate environment. Self-concept is our personal knowledge of who we are, encompassing all of our thoughts and feelings about ourselves physically, personally, and socially. Self-concept also includes our knowledge of how we behave our capabilities, and our individual characteristics. Our self-concept develops most rapidly during early childhood and adolescence, but self-concept continues to form and change over time as we learn more about ourselves.</p>
</div><div class="section" id="ch12lev1sec3"><h1 class="title">DEFINITION</h1>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Social psychologist Roy Baumeister says that self-concept should be understood as a knowledge structure. People pay attention to themselves, noticing both their internal states and responses and their external behavior. Through such self-awareness, people collect information about themselves. Self-concept is built from this information and continues to develop as people expand their ideas about who they are.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Humanist psychologist Carl Rogers believed that your self-concept was made up of three different parts:
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p class="">Ideal self: The person you want to be</p></li>
<li><p class="">Self-image: How you see yourself, including attributes like your physical characteristics, personality traits, and social roles</p></li>
<li><p class="">Self-esteem: How much you like, accept, or value yourself, which can be impacted by a number of factors including how others see you, how you think you compare to others, and your role in society <bold>(<a href="#ch12fig2" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 12.2</a>)</bold></p></li></ol></p></li>
<li><p class="">Self-esteem is defined as the way an individual thinks about himself or herself, and how good he or she feels. Positive self-esteem develops when a person feels good and capable of responding to challenges and stressors. Nevertheless, when a person exhibits mild to a remarkable shift in the view of him or herself such as negativity about self, low self-esteem develops. Low self-esteem can reduce the quality of a person's life in many different ways, including negative feelings, fear, relationship problems, or low resilience. This change in self-esteem is a temporary phase in response to feeling helpless to control the current situation.</p></li>
<li><p class="">According to Burns, “The Self-concept is self-esteem, self-worth or self-acceptance that includes all beliefs and judgments about ourselves, it will define who we are in our own mind, what we can do in our minds and what we become in our minds”.</p></li>
</ul>

</div><div class="section" id="ch12lev1sec4"><h1 class="title">CONCEPT OF SELF-CONCEPT</h1>
<p class="noindent">Self-concept is an essential part in the development of personality. Self in term of psychology has two meanings that is attitude and feelings of a person's towards himself, and something the whole psychological process that controls behavior and self-adjustment. Self-concept, the individual's perception of self, affects relationships, functional abilities, and health.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Self-concept is unique to the individual</p></li>
<li><p class="">It can be positive or negative;</p></li>
<li><p class="">It has emotional, intellectual, and functional dimensions</p></li>
<li><p class="">It changes with the environmental context</p></li>
<li><p class="">It changes over time</p></li>
<li><p class="">It has a powerful influence on one's life.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">A person's self-esteem is influenced by (and may also influence) his or her ability to function in the society and associate to others within it. Cultural norms, gender, and age are variables that affect how an individual sees himself or herself. Some of the common causes of low self-esteem include unhappy childhood, poor academic performance in school resulting in a lack of confidence, ongoing stressful life events, and poor treatment from a partner, parent or career, ongoing medical problems, or mental illness such as anxiety or depression.</p>
</div><div class="section" id="ch12lev1sec5"><h1 class="title">GOAL IN DEVELOPING SELF-CONCEPT</h1>
<p class="noindent">Since the self-concept begins to form, someone will behave in accordance with the self-concept they have. If a person's behavior is inconsistent with the concept itself, it would appear uncomfortable feeling in him. This is the most important of the concept of self. One's view of himself will determine the action to be done. If a person has a positive self-concept, it will form a high appreciation also to themselves, or to say that he has a high self-esteem. Respect for self is the self-evaluation will determine the extent to which a person sure of her abilities and her success. So, if he has a positive self-concept, demonstrated by the high self-esteem.</p>
<p class="indent">Everything behavior will always be focused on success. He will try and strive to always realize the concept itself. For example, if one feels that he can then he will study hard and work hard to prove that he is really good at such beliefs.<a name="page509"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">509</span></span> He also will not easily discouraged because they have confidence that he would succeed because of their versatility. Developing self-concept can be done in various ways, for example to learn to like yourself, develop positive thoughts about yourself and others, improve the quality of interpersonal relationships, being proactive, maintaining the balance of life and change the way we communicate.</p>
</div><div class="section" id="ch12lev1sec6"><h1 class="title">DEVELOPMENT OF SELF-CONCEPT (<a href="#ch12fig3" class="ulink-inter">FIG. 12.3</a>)</h1>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Self-concept begins to develop in early childhood. This process continues throughout the lifespan. However, it is between early childhood and adolescence that self-concept experiences the most growth.</p></li>
<li><p class="">By age 2, children begin to differentiate themselves from others.</p></li>
<li><p class="">By the ages of 3 and 4, children understand that they are separate and unique selves. At this stage, a child's self-image is largely descriptive, based mostly on physical characteristics or concrete details.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Children increasingly pay attention to their capabilities, and by about 6 years old, children can communicate what they want and need. They are also starting to define themselves in terms of social groups.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Between the ages of 7 and 11, children begin to make social comparisons and consider how they're perceived by others.</p></li>
<li><p class="">At this stage, children's descriptions of themselves become more abstract.</p></li>
<li><p class="">They begin to describe themselves in terms of abilities and not just concrete details, and they realize that their characteristics exist on a continuum. For example, a child at this stage will begin to see himself as more athletic than some and less athletic than others, rather than simply athletic or not athletic. At this point, the ideal self and self-image start to develop.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">Adolescence is a key period for self-concept. The self-concept established during adolescence is usually the basis for the self-concept for the remainder of one's life. During the adolescent years, people experiment with different roles, personas, and selves. For adolescents, self-concept is influenced by success in areas they value and the responses of others valued to them. Success and approval can contribute to greater self-esteem and a stronger self-concept into adulthood.</p>
<p class="indent">The self-concept is an important term for both social and humanistic psychology. Lewis (1990) suggests that the development of a concept of self has two aspects:</p>
<div class="figure" id="ch12fig3" data-label="Fig. 12.3"><div class="title"><span class="item-label">Fig. 12.3</span> Development of self-concept.</div><img alt="Fig. 12.3" src="/MediumImage/509-1.jpg"><div class="additional-markup"></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ch12lev2sec1"><h2 class="title">The Existential Self</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">This is ‘the most basic part of the self-scheme or self-concept; the sense of being separate and distinct from others and the awareness of the constancy of the self’.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The child realizes that they exist as a separate entity from others and that they continue to exist over time and space.</p></li>
<li><p class="">According to Lewis awareness of the existential self begins as young as two to three months old and arises in part due to the relation the child has with the world. For example, the child smiles and someone smiles back, or the child touches a mobile and sees it move.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch12lev2sec2"><h2 class="title">The Categorical Self</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Having realized that he or she exists as a separate experiencing being, the child next becomes aware that he or she is also an object in the world.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Just as other objects including people have properties that can be experienced (big, small, red, smooth and so on) so the child is becoming aware of himself or herself as an object which can be experienced and which has properties.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The self too can be put into categories such as age, gender, size or skill. Two of the first categories to be applied are age (“I am 3”) and gender (“I am a girl”).</p></li>
<li><p class="">In early childhood: The categories children apply to themselves are very concrete (e.g., hair color, height and favorite things). Later, self-description also begins to include reference to internal psychological traits, comparative evaluations and to how others see them.</p></li>
</ul>

<div class="section" id="ch12lev2sec3"><h2 class="title">Formation of Self-concept during Early Childhood</h2>
<p class="noindent">Self-concept develops and changes throughout the lifespan, but it is most in flux during the early years. Early childhood is a ripe time for young humans to perceive themselves in the world. There are three general stages of self-concept development during early childhood:</p>
<div class="section" id="ch12lev3sec1"><h3 class="title">Stage 1: 0 to 2 years old</h3>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">

<div class="section" id="ch12lev2sec5"><h2 class="title">Self-concept in Middle Childhood</h2>
<p class="noindent">During middle childhood (about 7 to 11 years old), children are beginning to develop a sense of their social selves and figuring out how they fit in with everyone else. They reference social groups and make social comparisons more often, and begin to think about how others see them. Other characteristics of their self-concept at this stage include:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">More balanced, less all-or-none descriptions</p></li>
<li><p class="">Development of the ideal and real self</p></li>
<li><p class="">Descriptions of the self by competencies instead of specific behaviors</p></li>
<li><p class="">Development of a personal sense of self</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">Culture begins to play a big role at this stage, but we’ll talk more about that later.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch12lev2sec6"><h2 class="title">The Development of Self-concept in Adolescence</h2>
<p class="noindent">Adolescence is where the development of one's self-concept really explodes.</p>
<p class="indent">This is the stage in which individuals (about age 12–18) play with their sense of self, including a time when they experiment with their identity, compare themselves with others, and develop the basis of a self-concept that may stay with them the rest of their life. During this period, adolescents are prone to greater self-consciousness and susceptibility to the influence of their peers and chemical changes happening in the brain. They enjoy greater freedom and independence, engage in increasingly competitive activities, compare themselves with their peers, and can value (even over-value) the perspective of others. In adolescence, there are two important factors that influence self-concept and self-worth:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Success in areas in which the adolescent desires success</p></li>
<li><p class="">Approval from significant people in the adolescent's life.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">When students have a healthy sense of self-worth and self-esteem, they contribute to a greater self-concept.</p>

<p class="noindent">According to Calhoun, the development of self-concept is divided into two, namely a positive self-concept and negative self-concept:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Positive self-concept:</bold> Positive self-concept show their self-acceptance where people with positive self-concept know himself very well.

<li><p class="">Individual views of him totally disorganized do not have feelings, stability and wholeness. The people really do not know who he is, his strengths and weaknesses or appreciated in his life.</p></li>
<li><p class="">View of himself too stable and orderly: This could occur because individuals are educated in a way that is very hard, thus creating a self-image that does not allow any deviation from set of laws which in his mind is a proper way of life.</p></li></ul></p></li>

<p class="noindent"><bold>Self-concept vs Self-esteem:</bold> Self-concept is an overarching idea we have about who we are—physically, emotionally, socially, spiritually, and in terms of any other aspects that make up who we are. We form and regulate our self-concept as we grow; based on the knowledge we have about ourselves. It is multidimensional, and can be broken down into these individual aspects.</p>
<p class="noindent"><bold>Self-concept vs Self-image:</bold> Self-image is related to self-concept but is less broad <bold>(<a href="#ch12fig8" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 12.8</a>)</bold>. Self-image is how an individual sees themselves, and it does not have to align with reality. A person's self-image is based on how they see themselves, while self-concept is a more comprehensive evaluation of the self, largely based on how a person sees themselves, values themselves, thinks about them, and feels about them. Carl Rogers posited that self-image is a component of self-concept, along with self-esteem or self-worth and one's “ideal self”.</p>
<p class="noindent"><bold>Self-concept vs Self-efficacy:</bold> Self-concept is a more complex construct than self-efficacy. While self-efficacy refers to an individual's judgments of their own abilities, self-concept is more general and includes both cognitive (thoughts about) and affective (feelings about) judgments about oneself.</p>
<p class="noindent"><bold>Self-concept vs Self-awareness:</bold> Self-awareness also influences self-concept. It is the quality or trait that involves conscious awareness of one's own thoughts, feelings, behaviors, and traits. To have a fully developed self-concept (and one that is based in reality), a person must have at least some level of self-awareness.</p>

</div><div class="section" id="ch12lev1sec10"><h1 class="title">SELF-CONCEPT THEORY</h1>
<p class="noindent">The self-concept theory holds many assumptions about our personal judgment towards ourselves. Here are some of them:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Self-concept is learned:</bold> One of the very basic assumptions of this theory is that no person is born with a self-concept. Self-concept is believed to develop as a person grows old. This means that our perceptions towards ourselves can be shaped and can be altered, and can also be affected by environmental factors. In this sense, self-concept is actually a product of socialization and development. A person may have a perception of himself different from what other people thinks of him. For example, an individual feels that he is generous while others see him as a selfish person.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Self-concept is organized:</bold> A person may have numerous views of himself. He may think that he is kind, patient, loving and caring, or selfish, cruel, rude and stubborn. No matter how many different perceptions you have on yourself, still, there is one perception that facilitates all of these insights, causing one organized self-concept. When a person believes something that is congruent to his self-concept, it is more likely that he would resist changing that belief. He tends to stick to his present view of himself for quite a long time, and changing this perception of his self may take too long, but change is feasible.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Lastly, self-concept is dynamic:</bold> As a person faces different situations and new challenges in his life, his insight towards himself may constantly change depending on the way he responds to such life changes. We see things depending on our self-concept. We behave according to how we see ourselves in a situation. Therefore, self-concept is a continuous development wherein we tend to let go of the things and ideas that are not congruent to our self-concept, and we hold on to those that we think are helpful.</p></li>
</ul>
</div><div class="section" id="ch12lev1sec11"><h1 class="title">CARL ROGERS AND THE SELF-CONCEPT THEORY OF PERSONALITY</h1>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Famed psychologist, theorist, and clinician Carl Rogers posited a theory of how self-concept influences and, indeed, acts as the framework for, one's personality. The image we have of who we are contributes to our personality, and our actions—combined with our personality—create a feedback loop into our image of ourselves. Rogers believed that our personality is driven by our desire for self-actualization. This is the condition that emerges when we reach our full potential and our self-concept, self-worth, and ideal self all overlap.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Self-image</bold> or how you see yourself. Each individual's self-image is a mixture of different attributes including our physical characteristics, personality traits, and social roles. Self-image doesn't necessarily coincide with reality. Some people might have an inflated self-image of themselves, while others may perceive or exaggerate the flaws and weaknesses that others don't see.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Self-esteem</bold> or how much you value yourself. A number of factors can impact self-esteem, including how we compare ourselves to others and how others respond to us. When people respond positively to our behavior, we are more likely to develop positive self-esteem. When we compare ourselves to others and find ourselves lacking, it can have a negative impact on our self-esteem.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Ideal self</bold> or how you wish you could be. In many cases, the way we see ourselves and how we would like to see ourselves do not quite match up.</p></li>

<p class="noindent">Erikson's (1963) psychosocial theory <bold>(<a href="#ch12tbl1" class="ulink-inter">Table 12.1</a>)</bold> states that an individual's development proceeds throughout life. Each of his eight developmental stages includes psychosocial tasks that need to be mastered:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Newborn and infant:</bold> At birth, the newborn does not differentiate itself from the parents. As the parents begin to care for the newborn, their feelings and attitudes toward the newborn will begin to develop the baby's self-concept. The parents will experience a change in their own self-concept. Parental roles are being established, body images are formed in the mother before and after giving birth, and emotional changes will affect the parents’ self-concept.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Toddler and preschooler:</bold> The toddler needs a supportive environment for body image and self-esteem to develop positively. The parents should provide the toddler with an environment to practice his newly learned skills. The toddler needs to be encouraged to try his skills again (such as learning to walk or potty training) if not successful at first. Praising the toddler for mastery of learning his new skill is important in developing a positive self-concept.<a name="page516"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">516</span></span></p>

<li><p class=""><bold>School age and adolescence:</bold> The school experience has a major impact on a child's development of self-concept, identity, body image, self-esteem, and role. Parents, teachers, and peers have a direct influence on the child's developing feelings, views, and sense of self. Children compare their physical appearance, academic and athletic abilities, and social status to those of their peers and seek approval and acceptance from this group.</p>
<p class="indent">Bullying by verbal, emotional, or technological methods (e-mail, chatting, blogging, texting, or twittering) is common in this age group and negatively affects a child's developing self-concept. The school-age child places importance on receiving acceptance and approval by one's peer group to feel included and positive about one.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Adulthood:</bold> The natural process of aging will lead to significant changes in a person's self-concept. Over the course of a lifetime, an adult will experience changes in one's roles, body, and identity. Young adults strive to develop relationships, careers, and often a family. Older adults attempt to define themselves by their accomplishments. Major life events in adulthood will continuously shape a person's self-concept, such as obtaining a college degree, getting a job, marriage, divorce, losing a job, retirement, and the death of a significant other. How the individual views and copes with these changes will determine the influence and impact they have on the person's self-concept.</p></li>

<p class="indent">The influential American psychologist Carl Rogers was the first to discuss the components of self-concept in 1959. He wrote about three major components <bold>(<a href="#ch12fig11" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 12.11</a>)</bold>:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p class=""><bold>Self-image:</bold> It's how we see ourselves. Our self-image is a combination of different attributes.</p>
<p class=""><ul style="list-style-type: square">
<li><p class="">Our personality traits (for example, introverted, kind)</p></li>
<li><p class="">Our social roles (for example, friend, student)</p></li>
<li><p class="">What we know about ourselves physically (for example, tall, short hair)</p></li>
</ul>
</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Self-esteem:</bold> Self-esteem is the value that we place on ourselves. Our self-esteem often depends on how we evaluate ourselves. In other words, we make personal comparisons and validate how others respond to us. For example, when our managers respond favorably to our achievements, we are encouraged by our performance and our self-esteem grows.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Ideal self:</bold> This is centered on how we wish we could be. For example, if our goal is to lead a large team someday, we create an ideal self and make a checklist of goals we want to work towards. We may direct all our efforts towards achieving that ideal version for ourselves.</p></li>
</ol>

</div><div class="section" id="ch12lev1sec14"><h1 class="title">WAYS TO DEVELOP A HEALTHY SELF-CONCEPT</h1>
<p class="noindent">It is important to remember that the formation of self-concept is a continuous pursuit. When we put some effort into boosting our self-evaluation, our self-concept adjusts accordingly.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p class=""><bold>Look within:</bold> We can start by looking at our inner selves, our belief systems and daily thoughts. If we feel that our ‘real’ self (who we are) is vastly different from our ‘ideal’ self (who we want to be), we should invest time and effort to address the difference. We can make adjustments by setting realistic expectations.<a name="page518"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">518</span></span></p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Check nonverbal:</bold> Our bodies and minds are connected. Sometimes, what we feel may reflect in our body language. However, there are times when we can redirect our self-concept through our physical movements. For example, some of us walk confidently to feel confident about ourselves.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Make important choices:</bold> Lifestyles and habits impact our self-concept to a large extent. It's one of the factors that determine how we may reach our ideal selves. For example, some of us make it a habit to sleep on time and wake up on time to remain productive throughout the day.</p></li>
</ol>
</div><div class="section" id="ch12lev1sec15"><h1 class="title">BODY IMAGE</h1>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">The attitude about one's physical attributes and characteristics, appearance, and performance changes as the body changes over time.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The way one perceives the body is affected by personal identity and self-esteem.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Self-esteem is the judgment of personal performance compared with the self-ideal.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The self-ideal is based on personal standards and self-expectations. Self-esteem is most threatened during adolescence.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Self-esteem is associated with locus of control. People with an internal locus of control perceive that they affect their own destiny, as opposed to people with an external locus of control, who perceive that others affect their destiny.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Normal growth and developmental changes may influence and alter body image, such as the physical and hormonal changes that occur during puberty and adolescence.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The onset of puberty involves the emergence of secondary sex characteristics in the female and male client.</p></li>
<li><p class="">While these are normal expected physical changes that occur during the adolescent stage, these changes will impact an adolescent's body image, thus affecting self-concept</p></li>
<li><p class="">In later adulthood, physical and hormonal changes present as thinning and graying of hair, wrinkling and loss of skin elasticity, weight gain, decrease in hearing and vision, and decrease in mobility.</p></li>
<li><p class="">While some adults accept these changes as the normal process of aging, others may find themselves resisting or feeling negatively about them.</p></li>

<p class="noindent">Confusion in mental picture of one's physical self.</p>
<p class="indent">Body image is how a person feels about his or her body and what they do about those feelings. Some may feel inferior about their bodies and try to improve them through a variety of means called appearance management behaviors. As a significant component of one's self-concept, body image disturbance can have an intense impression on how individuals see their overall selves.</p>
<p class="indent">A person begins forming his or her perceptions of body's attractiveness, health, acceptability and functionality in early childhood. This body image continues throughout the lifespan and receives feedback from peers, family member, and coaches. For example, a woman may experience Disturbed Body Image during pregnancy. Physical changes associated with aging may result in body image disturbance for the older adult. Personality traits such as perfectionism and self-criticism can also affect the development of a negative internalized image of the body.</p>
<p class="indent">Appropriate care for body image is a significant step to recovery. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, an approach where irrational thoughts are recognized, analyzed and restructured to more rational self-talk, is frequently used in planning care to address body image disturbance.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch12lev2sec48"><h2 class="title">Related Factors</h2>
<p class="noindent">Here are some factors that may be related to disturbed body image:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Permanent alteration in structure and/or function [e.g., mutilating surgery, removal of body part (internal or external)]</p></li>
<li><p class="">Situational changes (e.g., temporary presence of a visible drain or tube, dressing, attached equipment; pregnancy)</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch12lev2sec49"><h2 class="title">Defining Characteristics</h2>
<p class="noindent">Disturbed body image is characterized by the following signs and symptoms:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Actual change in structure or function</p></li>
<li><p class="">Alteration in social function (e.g., withdrawal, isolation, flamboyance)</p></li>
<li><p class="">Focusing behavior on changed body part/function</p></li>
<li><p class="">Intentional hiding of body part</p></li>
<li><p class="">Refusal to discuss or acknowledge change</p></li>
<li><p class="">Refusal to look at, touch, or care for altered body part</p></li>
<li><p class="">Verbal preoccupation with changed body part or function</p></li>
<li><p class="">Verbalization about altered structure or function of a body part.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch12lev2sec50"><h2 class="title">Goals and Outcomes</h2>
<p class="noindent">The following are the common goals and expected outcomes for disturbed body image:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Patient incorporates changes into self-concept without negating self-esteem.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Patient verbalizes acceptance of self in situation.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Patient discusses with family/SO about situation, changes that have occurred.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Patient develops realistic goals/plans for the future.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch12lev2sec51"><h2 class="title">Nursing Assessment</h2>
<p class="noindent">The nurse‘s assessment of the perceived alteration and importance placed by the patient on the altered structure or function will be very important in planning care to address body image disturbance.<a name="page525"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">525</span></span></p>

<p class="noindent">Self-concept is an overarching idea we have about who we are—physically, emotionally, socially, spiritually, and in terms of any other aspects that make up who we are. We form and regulate our self-concept as we grow, based on the knowledge we have about ourselves. It is multidimensional, and can be broken down into these individual aspects. Self-concept is the way people think about themselves. It is unique, dynamic, and always evolving. This mental image of oneself influences a person's identity, self-esteem, body image, and role in society. As a global understanding of oneself, self-concept shapes and defines who we are, the decisions we make, and the relationships we form. Self-concept is perhaps the basis for all motivated behavior.</p>
