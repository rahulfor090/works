</div><div class="section" id="ch15lev1sec2"><h1 class="title">INTRODUCTION</h1>
<p class="noindent">Psychosocial support involves the culturally sensitive provision of psychological, social and spiritual care. Nurses play a unique role in supporting patients; by building dialogue with patients nurses can begin to understand how patients view themselves as individuals, what is important to them, and how their relationship with others may affect their decisions and their ability to live with those decisions during their treatment and beyond (Ellis et al., 2006). Good communication and assessment skills are essential to building a rapport with patients and can help the nurse develop a clinical relationship with the patient and their family.</p>
</div><div class="section" id="ch15lev1sec3"><h1 class="title">MEANING OF CULTURE</h1>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Culture is a set of beliefs, attitudes, and practices shared by a group of people or community that is accepted, followed, and passed down to other members of the group.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The word “culture” may at times be interchanged with terms such as ethnicity, nationality, or race.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Cultural beliefs and practices bind group or community members together and help form a cohesive identity.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Culture has an enduring influence on a person's view of the world, expressed through language and communication patterns, family connections and kinship, religion, cuisine, dress, and other customs and rituals.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Culture is not static but is dynamic and ever-changing; it changes as members come into contact with beliefs from other cultures. For example, sushi is a traditional Asian dish that has become popular in America in recent years.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Nurses and other healthcare team members are impacted by their own personal cultural beliefs. For example, a commonly held belief in American health care is the importance of timeliness; medications are administered at specifically scheduled times, and appearing for appointments on time is considered crucial.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Most cultural beliefs are a combination of beliefs, values, and habits that have been passed down through family members and authority figures. The first step in developing cultural competence is to become aware of your own cultural beliefs, attitudes, and practices.</p></li>
</ul>
</div><div class="section" id="ch15lev1sec4"><h1 class="title">CONCEPTS—CULTURE, SUBCULTURE AND MULTICULTURAL</h1>
<p class="noindent">Culture provides an important source of values and comfort for patients, families, and communities. Think of culture as a thread that is woven through a person's world and impacts one's choices, perspectives, and way of life.<a name="page586"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">586</span></span> It plays a role in all of a person's life events and threads its way through the development of one's self-concept, sexuality, and spirituality. It affects lifelong nutritional habits, as well as coping strategies with death and dying. Culture influences how a patient interprets “good” health, as well as their perspectives on illness and the causes of illness. The manner in which pain is expressed is also shaped by a person's culture.</p>

<div class="section" id="ch15lev2sec1"><h2 class="title">Culture</h2>
<p class="noindent">An integrated pattern of human behavior that includes thoughts, communications, languages, practices, beliefs, values, customs, courtesies, rituals, manners of interacting, roles, relationships and expected behaviors of a racial, ethnic, religious or social group; the ability to transmit the above to succeeding generations; culture is always changing <bold>(<a href="#ch15tbl1" class="ulink-inter">Table 15.1</a>)</bold>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch15lev2sec2"><h2 class="title">Subculture</h2>
<p class="noindent">Smaller cultural groups that exist within but differ in some way from the prevailing culture interest sociologists. These groups are called subcultures. Examples of some subcultures include “heavy metal” music devotees, body-piercing and tattoo enthusiasts, motorcycle gang members, and Nazi skinheads. Members of subcultures typically make use of distinctive language, behaviors, and clothing, even though they may still accept many of the values of the dominant culture <bold>(<a href="#ch15tbl2" class="ulink-inter">Table 15.2</a>)</bold>.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">A subculture is a group of people within a culture that differentiates itself from the parent culture to which it belongs, often maintaining some of its founding principles.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Subcultures develop their own norms and values regarding cultural, political and sexual matters.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Subcultures are part of society while keeping their specific characteristics intact.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The concept of subcultures was developed in sociology and cultural studies. Subcultures differ from counter cultures.</p></li>
<li><p class="">First, it is important to understand the concept of a subculture.</p></li>
<li><p class="">A subculture is a unique culture shared by a smaller group of people who are also a part of a larger culture.</p></li>
<li><p class="">A larger culture often contains many subcultures, and an individual can be part of several of them.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Each subculture has distinct norms and customs that are not a part of the broader culture in which it is enveloped. Think of the Amish, or bikers, or hippies, or Whovians. Each of these groups has unique cultures, yet they all exist within the broad culture of the United States.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch15lev2sec3"><h2 class="title">Multicultural (<a href="#ch15box1" class="ulink-inter">Box 15.1</a>)</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">The term “multicultural” relates to the presence of multiple cultural groups within a single society; multicultural nursing involves an awareness of the different cultural groups that make up our society in a healthcare setting.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Together, transcultural (connecting different cultures) and multicultural (awareness of different cultures) skills allow you to grow as a person and as a professional.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Patients’ cultural views often influence their decisions about health care.<a name="page587"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">587</span></span></p></li>
<li><p class="">Being able to recognize these cultural concerns can help you overcome obstacles with patients and deliver the best care possible.</p></li>
<li><p class="">This perspective of multiculturalism respects cultural variations rather than requiring that the dominant culture assimilate the various cultures.</p></li>
<li><p class="">It holds that certain shared cultural tenets are important to society as a whole, but that some cultural differences are important, too.</p></li>
<li><p class="">For example, children in schools today are being taught that the United States is not the only culture in the world, and that other viewpoints may have something to offer Americans.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch15lev2sec4"><h2 class="title">Acculturation</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Acculturation is a process of social, psychological, and cultural change that stems from the balancing of two cultures while adapting to the prevailing culture of the society.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Acculturation is a process in which an individual adopts, acquires and adjusts to a new cultural environment.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Individuals of a differing culture try to incorporate themselves into the new more prevalent culture by participating in aspects of the more prevalent culture, such as their traditions, but still hold onto their original cultural values and traditions.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The effects of acculturation can be seen at multiple levels in both the devotee of the prevailing culture and those who are assimilating into the culture.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Acculturation is also a two-way process because both cultures will still change and be affected by each other.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch15lev2sec5"><h2 class="title">Cultural Assimilation</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Cultural assimilation is the process in which a minority group or culture comes to resemble a dominant group or assume the values, behaviors, and beliefs of another group.</p></li>
<li><p class="">A conceptualization describes cultural assimilation as similar to acculturation while another merely considers the former as one of the latter's phases.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Assimilation could also involve the so-called additive acculturation wherein, instead of replacing the ancestral culture, an individual expands their existing cultural repertoire.</p></li>

</div><div class="section" id="ch15lev1sec5"><h1 class="title">CULTURAL COMPETENCE</h1>
<p class="noindent">Cultural competence in nursing practice focuses on knowledge, attitude, and skill. Consistently working towards being culturally competent is an exercise in compassion and respect. Employ these techniques on a regular basis to grow your level of competency <bold>(<a href="#ch15tbl3" class="ulink-inter">Table 15.3</a>)</bold>:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Ask questions and take time to learn about what the answers mean in different cultures.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Use clear, descriptive communication that aligns with the communication practices of your patient's culture.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Keep an open mind and employ the skills you practice when the occasional conflict arises.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Acknowledge and be aware of any situations in which you may portray a lack of sensitivity, and work to keep from doing so.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Actively seek out colleagues and peers of different cultures to learn more about interacting and respecting your differences.</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="ch15lev2sec6"><h2 class="title">Increasing Cultural Competence in Nursing Practice</h2>
<p class="noindent">Through years of research and education, many medical scholars have shared knowledge and techniques that nurses can employ to practice cultural competence. Cultural competencies for nurses these techniques are built upon three pillars:<a name="page588"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">588</span></span></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p class="">Knowledge</p></li>
<li><p class="">Attitude</p></li>
<li><p class="">Skills</p></li>
</ol>
<div class="section" id="ch15lev3sec1"><h3 class="title">Knowledge</h3>
<p class="noindent">Learning about the culture base of those in your area is the first step to strengthening your cultural competence. Depending on your location, the number of cultures you encounter will vary. Seek out information on topics such as shared traditions and values of each cultural group. Berlin and Fowkes designed the mnemonic, LEARN, in conducting a cultural assessment.</p>
<p class="indent">This mnemonic stands for five steps outlined below:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p class=""><bold>Listen:</bold> Listen to the patient's perception of the presenting problem.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Explain:</bold> Explain your perception of the patient's problem. Is it physiological, psychological, spiritual, and/or cultural? It can and often will be more than one.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Acknowledge:</bold> Acknowledge the similarities and differences between the patient's perception and your perceptions. In certain cases, it may be easier to focus on the similarities while working towards bridging the gap between the differences.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Recommend:</bold> Recommendations are built upon the knowledge gained from the first three steps. It is inevitable that culture will affect the recommendations, and the patient must be involved in this process.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Negotiate:</bold> In some instances, the patient may require negotiating a treatment plan. It is imperative that nurses are sensitive to the cultural practices of each patient while still providing the best care possible.</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="indent">Cultural competency in nursing is an ongoing practice. Having the ability to execute an analysis ensures you can handle each unique situation as it arises.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch15lev3sec2"><h3 class="title">Attitude</h3>
<p class="noindent">Attitude plays a large role in the ability to become and serve as a culturally competent caregiver. In this case, “attitude” refers to a level of awareness in yourself and your patients in regards to stereotypes, rules of interaction and communication customs. A caregiver will likely identify most with the culture in which they were raised. With that comes a need to identify and debunk stereotypes from other cultures. There are situations in which we may portray a lack of sensitivity without knowing how our actions may affect others. Reflect on your own cultural attitude, so that even the most subtle of stereotypical tendencies do not affect the level of care provided to your patients.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch15lev3sec3"><h3 class="title">Skills</h3>
<p class="noindent">Developing a skill set based on increasing your cultural competency can be accomplished by focusing on skills like communication and conflict-resolution. Communication is a key component of skilled nursing. It also involves learning to adapt to new and different situations in a flexible way. Remember that the hospital environment may not be familiar ground for your patients.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch15lev2sec7"><h2 class="title">Cultural Factors Affecting Health and Disease</h2>
<p class="noindent">In order to improve the health behaviors of the community, cultural factors affecting health behavior and healthcare services need to be clearly recognized.</p>
<p class="indent">The individuals’ beliefs about health, attitudes and behaviors, past experiences, treatment practices, in short their culture, play a vital role in improving health, preventing and treating diseases.</p>
<p class="indent">Cultural variables can be motivational factors in health-disease relationships.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch15lev2sec8"><h2 class="title">Cultural Factors/Variables</h2>
<p class="noindent">Cultural factors/variables can be listed in the following list:</p>

<p class="noindent">Cultural competency, cultural safety, cultural respect, cultural awareness and cultural sensitivity are all terms that have (often interchangeably) been used to describe the training and/or attributes required by health professionals. Culture can be defined as complex beliefs and behaviors acquired as part of relationships within particular families and other social groups and can predispose people to view and experience health and illness in ways that can influence decisions, attitudes and beliefs around access and engagement in health care <bold>(<a href="#ch15fig1" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 15.1</a>)</bold>.<a name="page589"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">589</span></span></p>

<div class="section" id="ch15lev2sec9"><h2 class="title">Definition</h2>
<p class="noindent">Culturally responsive care can be defined as an extension of patient-centered care that includes paying particular attention to social and cultural factors in managing therapeutic encounters with patients from different cultural and social backgrounds</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch15lev2sec10"><h2 class="title">Culturally Responsive Care</h2>
<p class="noindent">The word “responsiveness” places emphasis on the capacity to respond. Examples include finding out about the patient's history of present illness, their health beliefs and use of alternative treatments, expectations of care, linguistic challenges, and culturally-based family dynamics that guide decision-making processes. A basic premise of culturally sensitive care is that healthcare professionals must be able to recognize the client's culture, their own culture, and how both affect the patient-provider relationship. The following are key in addressing this important premise <bold>(<a href="#ch15fig2" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 15.2</a>)</bold>:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Everyone has a culture.</p></li>
<li><p class="">There is an American medical culture and it is very different from many of the cultures that our patients and their families come from.</p></li>
<li><p class="">We need to understand where our American medical culture differs from other cultures in significant ways that impact communication and influence health outcomes for patients.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Resistance to cultural differences is part of being human, and reactions to cultural differences are automatic, often subconscious, and can have strong influence on the patient-provider relationship.</p></li>
<li><p class="">A provider's culture is influenced by his/her own personal values and beliefs, as well as those of the western medical culture.</p></li>
<li><p class="">A provider's ability to communicate effectively in cross-cultural interactions is greatly enhanced by his/her grasp of cross-cultural communication skills.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Culturally sensitive care requires a broad understanding of how culture affects health beliefs and behaviors.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Providing linguistically appropriate care requires being able to assess the need for interpreters in the clinical setting and interact with interpreters effectively.</p></li>

<li><p class="">Being culturally responsive places the onus back onto the health professional to appropriately respond to the unique attributes of the person, family or community they are working with.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Self-reflection and reducing power differences are central to being culturally responsive; therefore, making assumptions based on generalizations about a person's ethnic, cultural or social group is unacceptable. The issues to be considered which enable nurses to make cultural assessment are listed in <bold><a href="#ch15box3" class="ulink-inter">Box 15.3</a></bold>.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Part of the challenge of becoming culturally responsive health professionals is learning to reach beyond personal comfort zones and being able to comfortably interact and work with people, families and communities who are both similar and markedly different.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Assess; do not assume. Assess the influence of the family's cultural background on the child's behavior specific to health and illness. Do not assume that this child will act the same as the last child you took care of from the same cultural or ethnic group.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Humbly acknowledge yourself as a learner and consider that the child and family members have unique personal experiences in the healthcare system.</p>
<p class="indent">Confirm if the information that you have about a cultural group is accepted or practiced by your patient and their family.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Identify the family's culturally influenced practices, strengths and beliefs that you can include or support within what will be a mutually agreed upon plan.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Recognize that a family's cultural background will influence health-related behaviors as will previous experiences, level of education, language skills and socioeconomic status.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Interact from a place of cultural humility and create a culturally safe environment where patients and their families are respected for their unique healthcare practices, preferences and decisions.</p></li>

<div class="section" id="ch15lev2sec13"><h2 class="title">Psychosocial Assessment</h2>
<p class="noindent">Psychosocial assessments are often overlooked as a portion of the physical examination. However, a person's psychological well-being has much to do with physical health. The following guide to psychosocial assessment can be remembered by the acronym “SELF-PACING”. The findings from this assessment in addition to the physical findings will provide a comprehensive view of the patient's status.</p>
<p class="noindent"><bold>S—Self-esteem:</bold> Include information pertaining to hygiene, grooming, eye contact, statements about oneself and any other characteristics that provide information about the patient's self esteem.</p>
<p class="noindent"><bold>E—Energy level:</bold> Patient's with psychological problems often have an alteration in level of activity.</p>
<p class="noindent"><bold>L—Lifestyle:</bold> Living arrangements, significant relationships, occupation, hobbies or lack of interest in leisure activities, education, and any other data that provides information about the patient's personal situation.</p>
<p class="noindent"><bold>F—Family system:</bold> This refers to the patient's contact and support from family members or significant others, family stressors, crisis events, and usual coping skills.</p>
<p class="noindent"><bold>P—Physiological:</bold> This area relates to the results of the physical assessment.</p>
<p class="noindent"><bold>A—Affect:</bold> Include information about the patient's mood or emotional feelings. It may be described as happy, euphoric, flat, inappropriate, and other descriptive terms.</p>
<p class="noindent"><bold>C—Culture:</bold> This refers to all cultural, racial, or anthropological variables that influence one's lifestyle and mental health. This may refer to issues of homelessness. Assess religious and spiritual preferences, if any. Discuss any related food needs and other areas of impact spirituality will have on their health status.</p>
<p class="noindent"><bold>I—Interests:</bold> As expressed by the patient.</p>
<p class="noindent"><bold>N—Needs:</bold> As expressed by the patient (as opposed to those identified by the healthcare worker).</p>

<p class="noindent">Cultural diversity in nursing practice derives its conceptual base from nursing, other cross-cultural health disciplines, and the social sciences such as anthropology, sociology and psychology. Culture is conceptualized broadly to encompass the belief systems of a variety of groups. Cultural diversity refers to the differences between people based on a shared ideology and valued set of beliefs, norms, customs, and meanings evidenced in a way of life. Culture consists of patterns of behavior acquired and transmitted symbols, constituting the distinctive achievement of human groups, including their embodiment in artifacts; the essential core of culture consists of historically derived and selected ideas and especially their attached values.</p>

<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Transcultural nursing is a distinct nursing specialty which focuses on global cultures and comparative cultural caring, health, and nursing phenomena.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The transcultural nurse looks to respond to the imperative for developing a global perspective within the nursing field in an increasingly globalized world of interdependent and interconnected nations and individuals.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The primary aim of this specialty is to provide culturally congruent nursing care.</p></li>
<li><p class="">To be an effective transcultural nurse, you should possess the ability to recognize and appreciate cultural differences in healthcare values, beliefs, and customs.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Transcultural nurses should not only be familiar with the religious customs, values, and beliefs of patients, but also how someone's way of life, their modes of thought, and their unique customs can immensely affect them in how they deal with illness, healing, disease, and deaths.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Culturally competent nursing care helps ensure patient satisfaction and positive outcomes.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The need for transcultural nursing will continue to be an important aspect in health care. Additional nursing research is needed to promote transcultural nursing.</p></li>

<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Nurses connect with countless patients throughout their careers, and no two patients are alike. Transcultural nursing is the ability to connect with people from different cultures and to bring those cultures together to improve their health.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The term “multicultural” relates to the presence of multiple cultural groups within a single society; multicultural nursing involves an awareness of the different cultural groups that make up our society in a healthcare setting.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Cultural perspectives play a big role in shaping patients’ beliefs about their health and health care. As a nurse, your job is to provide the very best care for each patient. That means taking patients’ cultural backgrounds into consideration when helping them make decisions about their care.<a name="page596"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">596</span></span></p></li>

<div class="section" id="ch15lev2sec27"><h2 class="title">Roles and Duties of a Transcultural Nurse</h2>
<p class="noindent">Transcultural nurses seek to provide culturally congruent and competent care to their patients. Providing culturally congruent care means providing care that fits the patient's valued life patterns. Since this will vary from culture to culture, transcultural nurses are expected to be familiar with a wide variety of cultures and their corresponding values. Providing culturally competent care refers to the ability of the transcultural nurse to bridge cultural gaps in caring, as well as working with cultural contrast to enable clients and families to bring about meaningful care. The functions and obligations of transcultural nurses include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Communicate with foreign patients and their loved ones</p></li>
<li><p class="">Educate families on patients’ medical status</p></li>
<li><p class="">Act as a bridge between a particular patient's culture and healthcare practice</p></li>
<li><p class="">Determine the patient's cultural heritage and language skills</p></li>
<li><p class="">Determine if any of the patient's health beliefs relate to the cause of their illness or problem</p></li>
<li><p class="">Collect information on any home remedies the person is taking to treat their symptoms</p></li>
<li><p class="">Understand the influence of culture, race, and ethnicity on the development of social and emotional relationships, child-rearing practices, and attitude toward health</p></li>

<div class="section" id="ch15lev2sec28"><h2 class="title">Overcoming Barriers to Communication</h2>
<p class="noindent">Establishing an environment where cultural differences are respected begins with effective communication. This occurs not just from speaking the same language, but also through body language and other cues, such as voice, tone, and loudness:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Greet the patient using his last name or his complete name. Avoid being too casual or familiar. Point to yourself, say your name, and smile.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Proceed in an unhurried manner. Pay attention to any effort the patient or his family makes to communicate.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Speak in a low, moderate voice. Avoid talking loudly. Remember, we all have a tendency to raise the volume and pitch of our voice when a listener appears not to understand. But he may think that you are angry and shouting.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Organize your thoughts. Repeat and summarize frequently. Use audiovisual aids when feasible.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Use short, simple sentences and speak in the active voice.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Use simple words, such as “pain” rather than “discomfort.” Avoid medical jargon, idioms, and slang.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Avoid using contractions, such as don't, can't, or won't.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Use nouns instead of pronouns. For example, ask your patient's parent, “Does Juan take this medicine?” rather than “Does he take this medicine?”</p></li>
<li><p class="">Pantomime words, using gestures such as pointing or drinking from a cup, and perform simple actions while verbalizing them.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Give instructions in the proper sequence. For example, rather than saying, “Before you take the medicine, get into bed,” you should say, “Get into your bed, and then take your medicine.”</p></li>
<li><p class="">Discuss one topic at a time and avoid giving too much information in a single conversation. For example, instead of asking, “Are you cold and in pain?” separate your questions and gestures as you ask them: “Are you cold?” “Are you in pain?”</p></li>
<li><p class="">Validate whether the patient understands by having him repeat instructions, demonstrate the procedure you have taught him, or act out the meaning.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Use any appropriate words you know in the person's language. This shows that you are aware of and respect his native language.</p></li>

</div><div class="section" id="ch15lev1sec12"><h1 class="title">SPIRITUALITY AND NURSING</h1>
<p class="noindent">The word “spirituality” derives from the Latin word spiritus, which refers to breath or wind. The spirit gives life to, or animates, a person. It signifies whatever is at the center of all aspects of a person life. A person's health depends on a balance of physical, psychological, sociological, cultural and spiritual factors <bold>(<a href="#ch15fig9" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 15.9</a>)</bold>.</p>
<p class="indent">Spirituality is often identified as the important factor that helps to achieve the balance needed to maintain health and well-being and to cope with illness. Frequently spirituality becomes equated with religion and privacy of an individual's religious orientation. But spirituality is a much broader and more unifying concept than religion. Florence Nightingale described spirituality as the sense of presence higher than human, the divine intelligence that creates, sustains and organizes the universe and an awareness of our inner connection with this higher reality.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch15lev2sec33"><h2 class="title">Definition</h2>
<p class="noindent">Spiritual care which recognizes and responds to the needs of the human spirit when faced with trauma, ill health or sadness and can include the need for meaning, for self-worth, to express oneself, for faith support, perhaps for rites or prayer or sacrament, or simply for a sensitive listener. Spiritual care begins with encouraging human contact in compassionate relationship, and moves in whatever direction need requires’ (NHS Education for Scotland, 2009).</p>
<div class="sidebar" id="ch15box5"><ch15boxt5 class="title">Box 15.5. Meaning of spirituality.</ch15boxt5>
<p class="">Spirituality is about:</p>
<p class=""><ul style="list-style-type: square">
<li><p class="">Hope and strength</p></li>
<li><p class="">Trust</p></li>
<li><p class="">Meaning and purpose</p></li>
<li><p class="">Forgiveness</p></li>
<li><p class="">Belief and faith in self, others, and for some this includes a belief in a deity/higher power</p></li>
<li><p class="">Peoples’ values</p></li>
<li><p class="">Love and relationships</p></li>
<li><p class="">Morality</p></li>
<li><p class="">Creativity and self-expression</p></li>
</ul></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch15lev2sec36"><h2 class="title">Meaning and Definition</h2>
<p class="noindent">Spirituality is an important aspect of holistic care that is frequently overlooked. This is because of difficulties in conceptualizing spirituality and confusion about how it should be integrated into nursing care. This article explores what is meant by spirituality and spiritually competent practice. It examines attitudes to spirituality, describes factors that might affect the integration of spirituality into nursing care and offers practical guidance to equip nurses to incorporate spirituality into their practice. Spirituality is a concept that is unique to each individual. Individual's definitions of their own spirituality are influenced by their culture, life experiences, beliefs and ideas about life. There are two important characteristics of spirituality about which most authors agree:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p class="">It is a unifying theme in people's lives</p></li>
<li><p class="">It is a state of being an atheist search for meaning in life through their work and their relationships with other individuals.</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="indent">Because atheists feel they are alone, they sense a strong responsibility for themselves. They also tend to believe in a joint responsibility for others. In acting for themselves, they feel they should also act for all of mankind <bold>(<a href="#ch15box5" class="ulink-inter">Box 15.5</a>)</bold>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch15lev2sec37"><h2 class="title">Spirituality and Religion (<a href="#ch15fig10" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 15.10</a>)</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Religion and nature are two vehicles that people use to connect themselves with God or a high power; however, bonds to religious institutions, beliefs or dogma are not required to experience the spiritual sense of self.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Faith, considered the formulation of spirituality, is a belief in something that a person cannot see.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Spirituality is also a component of hope, and especially during chronic, serious or terminal illness, patients and their families often find comfort and emotional strength in their religious traditions or spiritual beliefs.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Recently, nurse researchers as well as pastoral care professionals, physicians, social workers, and others have proposed that spirituality has special importance as the integrating theme that unifies all aspects of an individual's health.<a name="page600"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">600</span></span></p></li>
<li><p class="">It is a force intrinsic to human nature and is one of the deepest and most potent resources for healing.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Religion is commonly associated with the state of doing or a specific system of practices associated with a particular domination, sect, or form of worship.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Religion is defined as a system of organized beliefs and worship that a person practices to outwardly express his or her spirituality.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Many clients practice a faith or belief in the doctrines, and expressions of a specific religion or sect, such as protestant catholic, orthodox, Jehovah's Witness, Judaism, Buddhism, Islam, and Hinduism.</p></li>
<li><p class="">A person's religion influences the manner in which an individual exercises a faith of belief and action.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Religion serves different purposes in people's lives. For some, religion is a set of rules and rituals used to worship a supreme being.</p></li>
<li><p class="">For others religion is a way of life providing nourishment and a connectedness to all of life. When providing spiritual care to clients it is important to understand the difference between religion and spirituality.</p></li>

<li><p class="">Building on the theories of Erickson and Piaget, Fowler (1981) formulated a theory of faith development as the person's integrating center of valuing.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Fowler's theory does not address the content of a person's faith such as a specific religious belief system, but views faith as another way of knowing the world, a spiritual knowing based on a particular phase of psychological and cognitive development.</p></li>

<li><p class="">Trust in caregivers is the basis not only for development of a sense of safety, security of self in the world, and interpersonal relationship but also for faith development.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Human beings’ initial knowledge of the world is through relationship. If parents who are secure and have a sense of meaning and commitment meet basic trust needs, infants will sense this kinesthetically and incorporate this feeling into their “innermost being”.</p></li>

<li><p class="">Children notice the difference between themselves as individuals and others in similar or different groups.</p></li>
<li><p class="">They continue to be sensitive to good-bad issues, often trying to “make up” for wrong doing in concrete, literal ways.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Children can now think in a historical perspective and see themselves as part of their family tree. The use of “story” is a major strategy for giving meaning to experience.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Childhood is the period when the lore, legends, language and symbols of a particular religious group are best presented.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Wishes, needs, facts and fantasy may appear somewhat confused, but children are attempting to make sense of the world. This period is the mythic-literal period.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The major change in adolescence is the beginning of the ability to think abstractly, to conceptualize, and to synthesize.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Adolescents can ask more sophisticated, philosophic questions, test the truth, evaluate others behavior, and note incongruities.

<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">In the individualize-reflective stage, young adults move away from the conforming peer group and clarify boundaries of self-hood and commitment.</p></li>
<li><p class="">An encounter with people or groups other than those that provided support in the previous stage often precipitates this shift.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Values, beliefs and attitudes change a result of interacting in more diverse, pluralistic settings, which can be stressful and frightening.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Some situations precipitating this shift include new jobs, international travel, advanced study or education, or new religious affiliations possibly intertwined with achieving intimate relationships, choosing careers and starting families.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The challenge during this stage is to establish one's own sense of faith and commitment based on personal experience and reflection on meaning in life.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The middle years are fulfilled through productive activity in Erickson's term, generativity. This time is of growth and renewed questioning, in some ways very similar to adolescence.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Adults, however, deal with a broader worldview rather than with group conformity.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Older adults notice the polarities or extremes in life such as young and old, rich and poor, masculine and feminine, war and peace, constructive and destructive, and self-awareness and self-denial.</p></li>
<li><p class="">These tensions enhanced or precipitated by personal and environmental situations, demand integration and resolution. This is referred to as conjunctive faith.</p></li>

<p class="noindent">The major characteristics of spirituality include a sense of wholeness and harmony within one's self, with God or a higher power as one defines it. It does not mean that individuals are totally satisfied with life or have all the answers. Assisting clients with the ensuring spiritual struggle is a valid and important aspect of maintaining health and giving health care <bold>(<a href="#ch15box6" class="ulink-inter">Box 15.6</a>)</bold>.</p>

<div class="section" id="ch15lev2sec42"><h2 class="title">Holism</h2>
<p class="noindent">Holism, the position of viewing the universe as a system of harmonious interconnectedness rather than sum of isolated parts, integrates the mind and body and emphasizes spirit. A holistic approach recognizes the spiritual struggle as valid and important aspects of health and health care. It is the integrating factorof “previously compartmentalized constructs of physical body, rational mind, emotional psyche, and intuitive spirit”.</p>
<p class="indent">The concept of a spiritual wellness program has been introduced in some long-term care facilities. In this program, a spiritual wellness staff uses a holistic approach to care in order to address the needs of older residents, their family members, and the staff. Sigmund Freud's early disciple Carl Lung expanded the concept of the unconscious to make it include good emotions and even spiritual urges.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch15lev2sec43"><h2 class="title">Spiritual Need</h2>
<p class="noindent">Definitions of spiritual need vary according to each author's belief system. In summarizing the various definitions, spiritual need represents a normal expression of a person's inner being that seeks meaning in all experience and a dynamic relationship with self, others and to the supreme other as the person defines it.</p>
<p class="indent">Spiritual needs include trust, forgiveness, love and relatedness, faith, creativity and hope, meaning and purpose and grace <bold>(<a href="#ch15fig12" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 15.12</a>)</bold>.</p>
<p class="indent">Spiritual needs are identified, as an individual's desire to find meaning and purpose in life, pain and death. The spiritual realms are often considered a very private area. In order to provide a holistic care, however, the nurse must pay attention to the spiritual dimension of each client, recognizing spiritual needs and assisting the client in meeting them <bold>(<a href="#ch15fig13" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 15.13</a>)</bold>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch15lev2sec44"><h2 class="title">Spiritual Quest</h2>
<p class="noindent">Life may be viewed as a spiritual quest, not only to answer life's philosophic questions but also to seek a higher level of consciousness or a deeper awareness of spiritual life.<a name="page603"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">603</span></span> For example, the recovery as a spiritual journey; group members practice a spiritual discipline to live more meaningfully day-by-day. Recovery begins through a “leap of faith” which lays that there is no meaning to be found other than that which is beyond one's self.</p>

<p class="indent">A common question asked by spiritual seekers is, to what extent they should pay attention to their health. For some seekers this question arises because interest in spiritual life, which is primarily a quest for the eternal, immutable, ever pure, immortal, infinite spirit, seems to be incompatible with interest in the everchanging, impure, limited, perishable physical body.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch15lev2sec45"><h2 class="title">Spiritual Well-being</h2>
<p class="noindent">Spiritual wellness manifests as inner strength and peace. Spiritual well-being is a condition marked by an affirmation of life, peace, harmony, and a sense of interconnectedness with God, self, community and environment that nurtures and celebrates wholeness. In the hierarchy of human needs, spiritual well-being appears to connote fulfillment of needs beyond the self-actualization level. All the subjects expressed a belief in a supreme being, had some means of communication with that entity through prayer and worship, and had an extensive social support system of meaningful personal relationships.</p>
</div>
</div><div class="section" id="ch15lev1sec15"><h1 class="title">FACTORS AFFECTING SPIRITUAL HEALTH</h1>
<p class="noindent">A number of factors affect expression of spiritual needs. Such things include culture, gender and previous experience. Individual reactions vary depending on personality and past coping styles. Other factors contributing to spiritual health include appropriate religious education, a firm spiritual identity, a dynamic and adaptable belief system, and maintenance of belief system in times of adversity or under questioning by others, recognition of spiritual assistance when needed, empathy for other's beliefs and values, and a sense of spiritual fulfillment <bold>(<a href="#ch15fig14" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 15.14</a>)</bold>.</p>
<p class="indent">Other factors, such as crises, moral issues, and separation, can affect changes in spiritual health and well-being, placing individuals at risk for altered spiritual function. These factors, however, are subjective and mean different things to different people<a name="page604"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">604</span></span>.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch15lev2sec46"><h2 class="title">Religious Problems</h2>
<p class="noindent">Client's religious problems can affect their spirituality. Customary religious practices, if interrupted or changed, may affect the structure or support that religion contributes to the person's sense of well-being.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch15lev2sec47"><h2 class="title">Change in Denominational Membership or Religious Conversion</h2>
<p class="noindent">Marrying a person with a different religious background or moving to a new community that does not have a branch of a particular religious group, will create, at least initially, loss for an individual. If a loss is felt, the individual experiences separation from a previously valued religious community. The extent of the loss is influenced by the choice the individual had in the change, how flexible the person's religious expression is, and what communities of faith are available to the individual.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch15lev2sec48"><h2 class="title">Loss or Questioning of Faith</h2>
<p class="noindent">A person often finds a way to express his or her faith through religious practices. Persons who are at an early stage of development of their faith who find their faith challenged by an event such as acute or chronic illness, terminal disease, or loss of a loved one may become vulnerable to loss of or doubt about their faith. This can also occur when one is shunned by one's religious community or when one is seriously a question the position one's religious denomination takes on a public issue. A loss or questioning of faith can cause serious guilt and a sense of loneliness even when it can lead to more mature faith and stronger conviction.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch15lev2sec49"><h2 class="title">Culture</h2>
<p class="noindent">Altitudes, beliefs and values arise from one's sociocultural background. Usually, but not always, people follow the spiritual and religious tradition of their families of origin. In inter faith marriages; children may follow the practices of one parent over the other. Many times, religious preference is tied to the ethnic background.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch15lev2sec50"><h2 class="title">Gender</h2>
<p class="noindent">Spiritual expression also depends on societies and the religious group's beliefs and teachings about gender or expected behaviors for males and females. A person's organized religion may prescribe how each sex dresses and if one wears a head covering. In some cases, the spiritual leader is always male.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch15lev2sec51"><h2 class="title">Previous Experience</h2>
<p class="noindent">It would appear that if one's faith and values are confronted, then deeper spiritual needs would arise. During a crisis, past coping styles or learned ways of handling situations are likely to be evident. Life experiences in general are influences. Such experiences may or may not be related to age.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch15lev2sec52"><h2 class="title">Crisis and Change</h2>
<p class="noindent">A crisis may strengthen a person's spirituality, which often happens when people face death. Just as crisis may strengthen one's faith, it may also weaken it. Crisis may be related to pathophysiologic changes, required treatments, or situations affecting the person. Personal changes that result from the death or illness of a loved one, opposition to personal religious beliefs by significant others, or change in personal status can become other sources of spiritual distress. Being hospitalized can interrupt usual religious practices at a time when they are most needed, which can add to spiritual distress.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch15lev2sec53"><h2 class="title">Separation from Spiritual Ties</h2>
<p class="noindent">Experience of being hospitalized or becoming a resident in a retirement or nursing home can initially be shattering. To some extent, such individuals are isolated from personal freedom, personal privileges, and social support systems. This separation from spiritual ties places people at risk for altered spiritual function.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch15lev2sec54"><h2 class="title">Moral Issues Regarding Therapy</h2>
<p class="noindent">Many religions view healers and the healing process as evidence of God at work in the world. Certain groups, however, object to some modern medical interventions. For example, some Christians oppose abortion because of their belief that the soul enters the body at conception. Religious teachings influence attitudes toward many other medical procedures such as right-to-die decisions, organ transplantation, circumcision, birth control, sterilization, autopsies and handling of the diseased. The choice to treat may be difficult to make if the religious beliefs say “no” and the healthcare system says “yes”. Many healthcare agencies have ethics committee to clarify and review such situation so more adequate and informed decisions are made.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch15lev2sec55"><h2 class="title">Inadequate or Inappropriate Care</h2>
<p class="noindent">When dealing with spiritual care, nurses must be careful neither to avoid assisting clients with such care nor to involve themselves without desire on the client's part. Doing nothing or jumping in too quickly may result in inadequate or inappropriate care.</p>
<p class="indent">Grandstorm (1985) elaborates on these reasons when she identifies five fairly complex values issues between nurses and clients.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch15lev2sec56"><h2 class="title">Pleuralism</h2>
<p class="noindent">Nurses and clients embrace a wide spectrum of beliefs and creeds. Fear: Related to not being able to handle situations, intruding on client's privacy, or becoming confused in one's own belief and value system.<a name="page605"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">605</span></span></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch15lev2sec57"><h2 class="title">Awareness of Own Spiritual Quest</h2>
<p class="noindent">What gives meaning, purpose, hope and sense of love in one's own life.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch15lev2sec58"><h2 class="title">Confusion</h2>
<p class="noindent">Confusion over difference between religious and spiritual concepts.</p>

<div class="section" id="ch15lev2sec62"><h2 class="title">Newborn and Infant</h2>
<p class="noindent">Hospitalization and illness potentially disrupt infant's basic trust in parents; the nurse can support the spiritual needs of parents by listening, offering support and promoting stability. Encourage parents to be present and involved in the caring process with infants as much as possible.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch15lev2sec63"><h2 class="title">Toddler and Preschooler</h2>
<p class="noindent">Support families to carry out rituals of faith. If the family is unavailable to do this, nurses can carry out these rituals for them.</p>
<p class="indent">Young children are sensitive to good or bad issue. Do not tell them that painful or scary treatments are in any way a punishment.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch15lev2sec64"><h2 class="title">School Age Child and Adolescent</h2>
<p class="noindent">Nurses continue to provide major support to families by carrying out familiar religious rituals in the healthcare setting. For children, classify fact and fantasy when it comes to all medical interventions and procedures. Acceptance and classification of the experience are the effective models to offer meaning to children. For adolescents, development of a personal style and interaction with peers remain priorities even during illness. Involve the adolescent's peers by encouraging them to remain available either through visits, letter or telephone. Adolescents are capable of conceptualizing personal relationship with God. In times of illness, they may question the meaning of the experienced, trying to integrate into their lives, much as adults would do under similar circumstances. These issues can often be discerned during a nursing history and assessment.</p>

<div class="section" id="ch15lev2sec65"><h2 class="title">Adult and Older Adult</h2>
<p class="noindent">Young adult's faith challenge is to establish and to reflect on personal faith and life's meaning. At the very least, all nurses must understand that young adults have the need for spiritual mentoring. Continue to be supportive of each client's family and social network because these relationships give meaning to the client's life. During the middle year, adults become more concerned with a broader worldview and polarities. By accepting the possibility of mutuality in the relationship, the nurse has the opportunity to give new meaning and hope to the client. As with other age groups, listening and support are essential as clients deal with health illness.</p>
<p class="indent">Using a life review strategy, in which clients recollect past experiences and come to the understanding of them, is helpful. As infirmity increases, older adults may be less able than previous years to participate in their faith communities. At this point, facilitate connection with people or groups in the community who can either visit regularly or assist with transportation.</p>

<div class="section" id="ch15lev2sec66"><h2 class="title">Special Population</h2>
<p class="noindent">There are differences in the spiritual concerns of persons with acute illness, persons living with pain, or persons facing surgery. For example, persons living with mental illness often have spiritual questions because the mental illness can be in a form expressed in terms of religious delusion or hallucinations. Often, though, healthcare providers including nurses avoid spiritual issues for fear of “supporting” the symptoms of the mental illness. There are new views of “recovery” as the spiritual need for hope.<a name="page607"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">607</span></span> Hope is the “turning” point in a person's illness.

<li><p class="">Spiritual.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div><div class="section" id="ch15lev1sec22"><h1 class="title">DEALING WITH SPIRITUAL DISTRESS/PROBLEMS</h1>
<p class="noindent">Spiritual distress is a disturbance in a person's belief system. As an approved nursing diagnosis, spiritual distress is defined as “a disruption in the life principle that pervades a person's entire being and that integrates and transcends one's biological and psychological nature <bold>(<a href="#ch15fig16" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 15.16</a>)</bold>.”</p>
<div class="section" id="ch15lev2sec71"><h2 class="title">Definition</h2>
<p class="noindent">Spirituality has been defined as “more of a journey and religion may be the transport to help us in our journey” (Narayansamy, 2004). Patients who are dying often think about their own spirituality. For some, it is a time to become more in touch with one's spirituality, and for others it is a time for their spirituality to become even stronger. Still, there are patients who do not want to discuss spiritual issues and are often angry at their situation and angry at any higher powers which they feel responsible for their impending death. As a nurse who cares for patients nearing the end of their lives, spirituality is something that needs to be taken into consideration.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch15lev2sec72"><h2 class="title">Meaning of Spiritual Distress</h2>
<p class="noindent">Spiritual pain or distress happens if you have questions and become upset about your beliefs and value systems. It occurs when a person is unable to find sources of meaning, hope, love, peace, comfort, strength, or connection in life. This may happen when something happens in our life those conflicts with our beliefs about ourselves and how we are in the world. Spiritual pain or distress can be normal feelings for someone who is living with illness. Spiritual distress most often occurs when a person is experiencing change, challenges, physical and emotional pain, other symptoms, and losses associated with serious illness.</p>

<p class="noindent">The indicators (pain, alienation, anxiety, guilt, loss, and despair) must or may be present in defining the characteristics of spiritual distress.

<p class="noindent">Spirituality is defined as connectedness with self, others, a life or God that allows people to experience, self-transcendence and find meaning in life. Spirituality helps people discover a purpose in life, understand the vicissitudes of life and develop their relations with God or a high power. Within the framework of spirituality a person discovers the truth about self, about the world and about the concepts such as love, compassion, wisdom, honesty, commitment, imagination, reverence, and morality. Often, spiritual behavior is expressed through sacrifice, self-discipline and spending time in activities that focus on the inner self or soul.</p>
