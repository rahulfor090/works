</div><div class="section" id="ch6lev1sec2"><h1 class="title">INTRODUCTION</h1>
<p class="noindent">Diagnostic tests help healthcare professionals in diagnosing, monitoring, and measuring treatment responses. Test results are rarely stand-alone and need interpretation within the context of the individual client's condition. A healthcare professional who is authorized to order-specific laboratory or diagnostic tests orders the tests to obtain the necessary information to monitor treatment and/or establish/confirm client diagnoses to initiate or continue an appropriate care plan. A diagnostic test is any approach used to gather clinical information for the purpose of making a clinical decision (i.e., diagnosis). Some examples of diagnostic tests include X-rays, biopsies, pregnancy tests, medical histories, and results from physical examinations.</p>
</div><div class="section" id="ch6lev1sec3"><h1 class="title">DEFINITION</h1>
<p class="noindent">Diagnostic tests consist of procedures, such as blood work, X-rays, CT scans, and any other test used to help physicians diagnose medical conditions. As part of Meg's responsibilities as a nurse, she may be required to assess the patient for readiness, provide education about the procedure, prepare equipment and supplies, and ensure the patient's safety.</p>
</div><div class="section" id="ch6lev1sec4"><h1 class="title">SALIENT FEATURES OF DIAGNOSTIC TESTING</h1>
<p class="noindent">The following are the salient features of diagnostic testing:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">The diagnostic test takes up where the formative test leaves off.</p></li>
<li><p class="">A diagnostic test is a means by which an individual profile is examined and compared against certain norms or criteria.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Diagnostic test focuses on individual's educational weakness or learning deficiency and identify the gaps in pupils.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Diagnostic test is more intensive and act as a tool for analysis of learning difficulties.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Diagnostic test is more often limited to low ability students.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Diagnostic test is corrective in nature.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Diagnostic test pinpoint the specific types of error each pupil is making and searches for underlying causes of the problem.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Diagnostic test is much more comprehensive.</p></li>
</ul>
</div><div class="section" id="ch6lev1sec5"><h1 class="title">INVASIVE VERSUS NONINVASIVE TESTS</h1>
<p class="noindent">The major difference between invasive and noninvasive tests is that invasive tests are done by cutting or entering a body part using medical instruments, whereas noninvasive tests do not require breaking the skin or entering the body. Noninvasive tests include deep palpation, X-rays, and checking blood pressure.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch6lev2sec1"><h2 class="title">Examples</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Cardiac catheterization is an invasive procedure that allows physicians to examine the heart of a patient. During this procedure, a physician measures the pressure inside the heart, evaluates arteries delivering blood to the heart, and observes how well the heart is pumping.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Balloon angioplasty is an invasive test that helps to treat any blockage present in the coronary arteries. A catheter with a small balloon is inserted into the blocked artery and dilated to open the artery that supplies the heart muscle with blood.</p></li>
<li><p class="">An atherectomy is an invasive procedure performed for removing atherosclerosis from blood vessels within the body. The narrowed arteries are widened by inserting a catheter carrying a device, such as a rotating drill or a cutter into the artery.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Placement of a coronary stent (a cylinder of wire mesh that is placed in a previously blocked artery to ensure that it stays open) is an invasive medical procedure. It is usually placed by a catheter (tube).<a name="page225"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">225</span></span></p></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div><div class="section" id="ch6lev1sec6"><h1 class="title">ROLE OF NURSE IN DIAGNOSTIC TEST</h1>
<p class="noindent">The nurse applies the diagnostic care model to all phases of testing to include the requisite knowledge and skills to provide safe, informed care; acts as a patient advocate; follows professional practice standards; communicates effectively; coordinates and manages the testing environment; supports patients through the process; and uses a collaborative approach to facilitate optimal patient outcomes. Diagnostic tests can be invasive and noninvasive. Registered nurses perform some aspects of both noninvasive and invasive diagnostic tests, such as an ECG and a blood sample for blood glucose testing, for example.</p>
<p class="indent">Regardless of the nature of the diagnostic test, some of the general rule and procedures relating to all client diagnostic tests include:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">The verification of the doctor's order for the particular diagnostic test</p></li>
<li><p class="">The verification and validation of the client's identity using at least two unique identifiers</p></li>
<li><p class="">Providing the client and/or significant others with an explanation of the diagnostic test, the purpose of the diagnostic tests and the procedure that will be followed for the specific diagnostic test, in addition to any specific preparation, such as NPO after midnight, as indicated for the particular diagnostic test</p></li>
<li><p class="">The verification of the client's consent to the diagnostic test, as indicated</p></li>
<li><p class="">The proper adherence to universal precautions, medical or surgical asepsis as indicated by the type of the diagnostic test</p></li>
<li><p class="">Proper hand washing before and after each specimen collection and/or bedside diagnostic testing</p></li>
<li><p class="">The proper, complete and accurate labeling of all specimens that are obtained by the nurse at the bedside that minimally includes the client's full name, the date and time of the specimen collection</p></li>
<li><p class="">The proper preservation and transportation of the specimen to the laboratory in a timely manner along with the proper laboratory requisition slip</p></li>
<li><p class="">The use of the proper receptacle or container for the specific specimen that contains any necessary preservatives, chemical or anticoagulants</p></li>
<li><p class="">The proper disposal of all supplies and equipment that was used for the diagnostic test.</p></li>
</ul>
</div><div class="section" id="ch6lev1sec7"><h1 class="title">COMPLETE BLOOD COUNT</h1>
<p class="noindent">A complete blood count (CBC) is a blood test used to evaluate your overall health and detect a wide range of disorders, including anemia, infection and leukemia. A complete blood count test measures several components and features of your blood, including—red blood cells, which carry oxygen.</p>
<p class="indent">A complete blood count test measures several components and features of your blood, including:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Red blood cells, which carry oxygen</p></li>
<li><p class="">White blood cells, which fight infection</p></li>
<li><p class="">Hemoglobin, the oxygen-carrying protein in red blood cells</p></li>
<li><p class="">Hematocrit, the proportion of red blood cells to the fluid component, or plasma, in your blood</p></li>
<li><p class="">Platelets, which help with blood clotting</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent"><bold><a href="#ch6fig1" class="ulink-inter">Figure 6.1</a></bold> depicts the CBC procedure.</p>
<p class="noindent"><bold>A CBC test usually includes:</bold></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>White blood cell (WBC, leukocyte) count:</bold> White blood cells protect the body against infection. If an infection develops, white blood cells attack and destroy the bacteria, virus, or other organism causing it. White blood cells are bigger than red blood cells but fewer in number. When a person has a bacterial infection, the number of white cells rises very quickly. The number of white blood cells is sometimes used to find an infection or to see how the body is dealing with cancer treatment.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>White blood cell types (WBC differential):</bold> The major types of white blood cells are neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils. Immature neutrophils, called band neutrophils, are also part of this test. Each type of cell plays a different role in protecting the body. The numbers of each one of these types of white blood cells give important information about the immune system. Too many or too few of the different types of white blood cells can help find an infection, an allergic or toxic reaction to medicines or chemicals, and many conditions, such as leukemia.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Red blood cell (RBC) count:</bold> Red blood cells carry oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body. They also carry carbon dioxide back to the lungs so it can be exhaled. If the RBC count is low (anemia), the body may not be getting the oxygen it needs. If the count is too high (a condition called polycythemia), there is a chance that the red blood cells will clump together and block tiny blood vessels (capillaries). This also makes it hard for your red blood cells to carry oxygen.</p>
<p class=""><div class="figure" id="ch6fig1" data-label="Fig. 6.1"><div class="title"><span class="item-label">Fig. 6.1</span> Complete blood count (CBC) procedure.</div><img alt="Fig. 6.1" src="/MediumImage/225-1.jpg"><div class="additional-markup"></div></div><a name="page226"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">226</span></span></p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Hematocrit (HCT, packed cell volume, PCV):</bold> This test measures the amount of space (volume) red blood cells take up in the blood. The value is given as a percentage of red blood cells in a volume of blood. For example, a hematocrit of 38 means that 38% of the blood's volume is made of red blood cells. Hematocrit and hemoglobin values are the two major tests that show if anemia or polycythemia is present.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Hemoglobin (Hgb):</bold> The hemoglobin molecule fills up the red blood cells. It carries oxygen and gives the blood cell its red color. The hemoglobin test measures the amount of hemoglobin in blood and is a good measure of the blood's ability to carry oxygen throughout the body.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Red blood cell indices:</bold> There are three red blood cell indices—mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC). They are measured by a machine, and their values come from other measurements in a CBC. The MCV shows the size of the red blood cells. The MCH value is the amount of hemoglobin in an average red blood cell. The MCHC measures the concentration of hemoglobin in an average red blood cell. These numbers help in the diagnosis of different types of anemia. Red cell distribution width (RDW) can also be measured which shows if the cells are all the same or different sizes or shapes.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Platelet (thrombocyte) count:</bold> Platelets (thrombocytes) are the smallest type of blood cell. They are important in blood clotting. When bleeding occurs, the platelets swell, clump together, and form a sticky plug that helps stop the bleeding. If there are too few platelets, uncontrolled bleeding may be a problem. If there are too many platelets, there is a chance of a blood clot forming in a blood vessel. Also, platelets may be involved in hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis).</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Mean platelet volume (MPV):</bold> Mean platelet volume measures the average amount (volume) of platelets. Mean platelet volume is used along with platelet count to diagnose some diseases. If the platelet count is normal, the mean platelet volume can still be too high or too low.</p>
<p class="indent"><bold><a href="#ch6tbl1" class="ulink-inter">Table 6.1</a></bold> depicts the complete blood count with differential.</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="ch6lev2sec2"><h2 class="title">Procedure</h2>
<p class="noindent">During a CBC, a lab technician will draw blood from a vein, typically from the inside of your elbow or from the back of your hand. The test will take only a few minutes. The technician:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Cleans your skin with an antiseptic wipe</p></li>
<li><p class="">Places an elastic band, or tourniquet, around your upper arm to help the vein swell with blood</p></li>
<li><p class="">Inserts a needle into vein and collects a blood sample into one or more vials</p></li>
<li><p class="">Removes the elastic band</p></li>
<li><p class="">Covers the area with a bandage to stop any bleeding</p></li>
<li><p class="">Label your sample and send it to a lab for analysis</p></li>

<div class="section" id="ch6lev2sec3"><h2 class="title">Definition</h2>
<p class="noindent">Electrolytes are positively and negatively charged molecules called ions that are found within the body's cells and extracellular fluids including blood plasma. A test for electrolytes includes the measurement of sodium, potassium, chloride, and bicarbonate. These ions are measured to assess renal (kidney), endocrine (glandular), and acid-base function, and are components of both renal function and comprehensive metabolic biochemistry profiles. Other important electrolytes routinely measured in serum or plasma includes calcium and phosphorus. These are measured together because they are both affected by bone and parathyroid diseases, and often move in opposing directions. Magnesium is another electrolyte that is routinely measured. Like calcium, it will cause tetany (uncontrolled muscle contractions) when levels are too low in the extracellular.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch6lev2sec4"><h2 class="title">Purpose</h2>
<p class="noindent">Tests that measure the concentration of electrolytes are needed for both the diagnosis and management of renal, endocrine, acid-base, water balance, and many other conditions. Their importance lies in part with the serious consequences that follow from the relatively small changes that diseases or abnormal conditions may cause. For example, the reference range for potassium is 3.6–5.0 mmol/L. Potassium is often a STAT (needed immediately) test because values below 3.0 mmol/L are associated with arrhythmia (irregular heartbeat), tachycardia (rapid heartbeat), and cardiac arrest, and values above 6.0 mmol/L are associated with bradycardia (slow heartbeat) and heart failure. Abnormal potassium cannot be treated without reference to bicarbonate, which is a measure of the buffering capacity of the plasma. Sodium bicarbonate and dissolved carbon dioxide act together to resist changes in blood pH.</p>

<div class="section" id="ch6lev2sec5"><h2 class="title">Measurement of Electrolytes</h2>
<p class="noindent">Electrolytes are measured by a process known as potentiometry. This method measures the voltage that develops between the inner and outer surfaces of an ion selective electrode. The electrode (membrane) is made of a material that is selectively permeable to the ion being measured. This potential is measured by comparing it to the potential of a reference electrode. Since the potential of the reference electrode is held constant, the difference in voltage between the two electrodes is attributed to the concentration of ion in the sample.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch6lev2sec6"><h2 class="title">Precautions</h2>
<p class="noindent">Electrolyte tests are performed on whole blood, plasma, or serum, usually collected from a vein or capillary. Special procedures are followed when collecting a sweat sample for electrolyte analysis. This procedure, called pilocarpine iontophoresis, uses electric current applied to the arm of the patient (usually an infant) in order to convey the pilocarpine to the sweat glands where it will stimulate sweating. Care must be taken to ensure that the collection device (macroduct tubing or gauze) does not become contaminated and that the patient's parent or guardian understands the need for the electrical equipment employed.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch6lev2sec7"><h2 class="title">Preparation</h2>
<p class="noindent">Usually no special preparation is necessary by the patient. Samples for calcium and phosphorus and for magnesium should be collected following an eight-hour fast.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch6lev2sec8"><h2 class="title">Aftercare</h2>
<p class="noindent">Discomfort or bruising may occur at the puncture site, or the person may feel dizzy or faint. Pressure to the puncture site until the bleeding stops reduces bruising. Applying warm packs to the puncture site relieves discomfort.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch6lev2sec9"><h2 class="title">Risks</h2>
<p class="noindent">Minor temporary discomfort may occur with any blood test, but there are no complications specific to electrolyte testing.<a name="page228"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">228</span></span></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch6lev2sec10"><h2 class="title">Normal Results</h2>
<p class="noindent">Electrolyte concentrations are similar whether measured in serum or plasma. Values are expressed as mmol/L for sodium, potassium, chloride, and bicarbonate. Magnesium results are often reported as milliequivalents per liter (meq/L) or in mg/dL. Total calcium is usually reported in mg/dL and ionized calcium in mmol/L. Since severe electrolyte disturbances can be associated with life-threatening consequences, such as heart failure, shock, coma, or tetany, alert values are used to warn physicians of impending crisis. Typical reference ranges and alert values are cited below:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">

<li><p class="">Screen for liver infections, such as hepatitis</p></li>
<li><p class="">Monitor the progression of a disease, such as viral or alcoholic hepatitis, and determine how well a treatment is working</p></li>
<li><p class="">Measure the severity of a disease, particularly scarring of the liver (cirrhosis)</p></li>
<li><p class="">Monitor possible side effects of medications</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">Liver function tests check the levels of certain enzymes and proteins in your blood. Levels that are higher or lower than normal can indicate liver problems. Some common liver function tests include:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Alanine transaminase (ALT):</bold> ALT is an enzyme found in the liver that helps convert proteins into energy for the liver cells. When the liver is damaged, ALT is released into the bloodstream and levels increase.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Aspartate transaminase (AST):</bold> AST is an enzyme that helps metabolize amino acids. Such as ALT, AST is normally present in blood at low levels. An increase in AST levels may indicate liver damage, disease or muscle damage.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Alkaline phosphatase (ALP):</bold> ALP is an enzyme found in the liver and bone and is important for breaking down proteins. Higher-than-normal levels of ALP may indicate liver damage or disease, such as a blocked bile duct, or certain bone diseases.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Albumin and total protein:</bold> Albumin is one of several proteins made in the liver. Your body needs these proteins to fight infections and to perform other functions. Lower-than-normal levels of albumin and total protein may indicate liver damage or disease.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Bilirubin:</bold> Bilirubin is a substance produced during the normal breakdown of red blood cells. Bilirubin passes through the liver and is excreted in stool. Elevated levels of bilirubin (jaundice) might indicate liver damage or disease or certain types of anemia.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT):</bold> GGT is an enzyme in the blood. Higher-than-normal levels may indicate liver or bile duct damage.<a name="page229"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">229</span></span></p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>L-lactate dehydrogenase (LD):</bold> LD is an enzyme found in the liver. Elevated levels may indicate liver damage but can be elevated in many other disorders.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Prothrombin time (PT):</bold> PT is the time it takes your blood to clot. Increased PT may indicate liver damage but can also be elevated if you are taking certain blood-thinning drugs, such as warfarin.</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="ch6lev2sec11"><h2 class="title">Risks</h2>
<p class="noindent">The blood sample for liver function tests is usually taken from a vein in your arm. The main risk associated with blood tests is soreness or bruising at the site of the blood draw. Most people do not have serious reactions to having blood drawn.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch6lev2sec12"><h2 class="title">Preparation</h2>
<p class="noindent">Certain foods and medications can affect the results of your liver function tests. Your doctor will probably ask you to avoid eating food and taking some medications before your blood is drawn.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch6lev2sec13"><h2 class="title">During the Test</h2>
<p class="noindent">The blood sample for liver function tests is usually drawn through a small needle inserted into a vein in the bend of your arm. The needle is attached to a small tube, to collect your blood. You may feel a quick pain as the needle is inserted into your arm and experience some short-term discomfort at the site after the needle is removed.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch6lev2sec14"><h2 class="title">After the Test</h2>
<p class="noindent">The blood will be sent to a laboratory for analysis. If the lab analysis is done on-site, you could have your test results within hours. If your doctor sends your blood to an off-site laboratory, you may receive the results within several days.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch6lev2sec15"><h2 class="title">Results</h2>
<p class="noindent">Normal blood test results for typical liver function tests include:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">

<div class="section" id="ch6lev2sec16"><h2 class="title">Purpose</h2>
<p class="noindent">The purpose of blood lipid testing is to determine whether abnormally high or low concentrations of a specific lipid are present. Low levels of cholesterol are associated with liver failure and inherited disorders of cholesterol production. Cholesterol is a primary component of the plaques that form in atherosclerosis and is therefore the major risk factor for the rapid progression of coronary artery disease (CAD).<a name="page230"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">230</span></span> High blood cholesterol may be inherited or result from such other conditions as biliary obstruction, diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, and nephrotic syndrome. In addition, cholesterol levels may be increased in persons who eat foods that are rich in saturated fats and cholesterol, and who lead a sedentary lifestyle.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch6lev2sec17"><h2 class="title">Description</h2>
<p class="noindent">Cholesterol screening can be performed with or without fasting, but it should include tests of total and HDL cholesterol levels. The frequency of cholesterol testing depends on the patient's risk of developing CAD. Adults over 20 with total cholesterol levels below 200 mg/dL should be tested once every five years. People with higher levels should be tested for LDL cholesterol levels, and tested at least once per year thereafter if their LDL cholesterol is 130 mg/dL or higher. The National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) suggests further evaluation when the patient has any of the symptoms of CAD, or if she/he has two or more of the following risk factors for CAD:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">High blood pressure</p></li>
<li><p class="">History of cigarette smoking</p></li>
<li><p class="">Diabetes</p></li>
<li><p class="">Low HDL levels</p></li>
<li><p class="">Family history of CAD</p></li>
<li><p class="">Age over 45 years (men) or 55 years (women)</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">Measurements of cholesterol and triglyceride levels are routinely performed in all patients.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch6lev2sec18"><h2 class="title">Preparation</h2>
<p class="noindent">Patients who are scheduled for a lipid profile test should fast (except for water) for 12 to 14 hours before the blood sample is drawn. If the patient's LDL cholesterol is to be measured, he/she should also avoid alcohol for 24 hours before the test. When possible, patients should also stop taking any medications that may affect the accuracy of the test results. These drugs include corticosteroids; estrogen or androgens; oral contraceptives; some diuretics; antipsychotic medications, including haloperidol; some antibiotics; and niacin. Antilipemics are drugs that lower the concentration of fatty substances in the blood. When these medications are taken by the patient, blood testing may be done frequently to evaluate liver function as well as lipid levels.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch6lev2sec19"><h2 class="title">Aftercare</h2>
<p class="noindent">Aftercare following blood lipid tests includes routine care of the skin around the needle puncture. Most patients have no aftereffects, but some may have a small bruise or swelling. A washcloth soaked in warm water usually relieves any discomfort. In addition, the patient can resume taking any prescription medications that were discontinued before the test.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch6lev2sec20"><h2 class="title">Risks</h2>
<p class="noindent">The primary risk to the patient from blood tests of lipid levels is a mild stinging or burning sensation during the venipuncture, with minor swelling or bruising afterward.</p>
<p class="indent">Although amniocentesis is much safer in the third trimester, and is less risky when it is performed with the guidance of ultrasound technology, does present a risk of miscarriage and fetal injury. The mother should be monitored for any signs of bleeding, infection, or impending labor.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch6lev2sec21"><h2 class="title">Results</h2>
<p class="noindent">The normal values for serum lipids depend on the patient's age, sex, and race. Normal values for people in Western countries are usually given as 140–220 mg/dL for total cholesterol in adults, although as many as 5% of the population have a total cholesterol higher than 300 mg/dL. Among Asians, the figures are about 20% lower. As a rule, both total and LDL cholesterol levels rise as people get older. Normal values for HDL cholesterol are also age- and sex-dependent. The range for males between 20 and 29 years is approximately 30–63 mg/dL; for females of the same age group, it is 33–83 mg/dL. Normal values for fasting triglycerides are also age- and sex-dependent. The reference range for adult males 20 to 29 years is 45–200 mg/dL; for females of the same age group, it is 37–144 mg/dL. As with cholesterol, the normal range rises with age.</p>
<p class="indent">Since a person's diet and lifestyle affect normal values, which are determined by the interval between the 5th and 95th percentile of the group, it is more helpful to evaluate cholesterol and triglycerides from the perspective of desirable plasma levels. The desirable values defined by the Nation Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) in 2001 are as follows:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Total cholesterol:</bold> Less than 200 mg/dL; 200–239 mg/dL is considered borderline high and greater than 240 mg/dL is high.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>HDL cholesterol:</bold> Less than 40 mg/dL is low.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>LDL cholesterol:</bold> Less than 100 mg/dL is optimal; near-optimal is 100–129 mg/dL; borderline high is 130–159 mg/dL; high is 160–189 mg/dL; and very high is any value over 190 mg/dL.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Total cholesterol:</bold> HDL ratio: Under 4.0 in males; 3.8 in females.</p></li>

<p class="noindent">Many types of glucose tests exist and they can be used to estimate blood sugar levels at a given time or, over a longer period of time, to obtain average levels or to see how fast body is able to normalize changed glucose levels. Eating food for example leads to elevated blood sugar levels. In healthy people, these levels quickly return to normal via increased cellular glucose uptake which is primarily mediated by increase in blood insulin levels.</p>

<div class="section" id="ch6lev2sec22"><h2 class="title">Random Blood Glucose Level</h2>
<p class="noindent">A sample of blood taken at any time can be a useful test if diabetes is suspected. A level of 11.1 mmol/L or more in the blood sample indicates that you have diabetes. A fasting blood glucose test may be done to confirm the diagnosis.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch6lev2sec23"><h2 class="title">Fasting Blood Glucose Level</h2>
<p class="noindent">A glucose level below 11.1 mmol/L on a random blood sample does not rule out diabetes. A blood test taken in the morning before you eat anything is a more accurate test. Do not eat or drink anything except water for 8–10 hours before a fasting blood glucose test. A level of 7.0 mmol/L or more indicates that you have diabetes.</p>
<p class="indent">If you have no symptoms of diabetes but the blood test shows a glucose level of 7.0 mmol/L or more, the blood test must be repeated to confirm you have diabetes. If you do have symptoms and the blood test shows a glucose level of 7.0 mmol/L or more, the test does not need to be repeated.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch6lev2sec24"><h2 class="title">Oral Glucose Tolerance Test</h2>
<p class="noindent">This test is not now usually used to diagnose diabetes. However, the test may be done if it is thought your body does not control glucose levels normally but not badly enough to be called diabetes. This is referred to as prediabetes (impaired glucose tolerance). The test may also be used to see whether a woman has developed diabetes associated with pregnancy.</p>
<p class="indent">For this test, you fast overnight. In the morning, you are given a drink which contains 75 g of glucose. A blood sample is taken two hours later. Normally, your body should be able to deal with the glucose and your blood level should not go too high. A glucose level of 11.1 mmol/L or more in the blood sample taken after two hours indicates that you have diabetes.</p>

<p class="noindent">If you have diabetes, your HbA1c level may be done every 2–6 months by your doctor or nurse. This test measures your recent average blood sugar (glucose) level. Because it is an average measurement you do NOT need to fast on the day of the test. The test measures a part of the red blood cells. Glucose in the blood attaches to part of the red blood cells. This part can be measured and gives a good indication of your average blood glucose over the previous 2–3 months.</p>

However, this may not always be possible to achieve and the target level of HbA1c should be agreed on an individual basis between you and your doctor. (For example, by increasing the dose of medication, improving your diet, etc.)</p>

<p class="noindent">A blood sugar test is done to measure the amount of glucose content in your blood. You can check your sugar level at a doctor's office or even at your home! The main source of glucose in your blood is caused due to the breakdown of carbohydrates. Insulin, a hormone produced by the pancreas, is responsible for the breakdown of sugar in our body. When it malfunctions, the sugar level in the blood may increase or decrease. Although glucose is the main source of energy for our body, extremely high or low levels of it is harmful for our very existence.</p>
<p class="indent"><bold><a href="#ch6fig5" class="ulink-inter">Figure 6.5</a></bold> depicts the glucose testing routine and <bold><a href="#ch6fig6" class="ulink-inter">Figure 6.6</a></bold> is showing the equipment for blood sugar testing.</p>

<p class="noindent">The steps are similar for many meters, and generally look like this:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Wash and dry your hands—using warm water may help the blood flow.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Turn on the meter and prepare a test strip as outlined in your owner's booklet. Many Accu-Chek meters turn on automatically when a strip is inserted.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Choose your spot—do not check from the same finger all the time. Using the side of the fingertip may be less painful than the pads.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Prepare the lancing device according to the user guide provided, then lance your fingertip or other approved site to get a drop of blood.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Touch and hold the test strip opening to the drop until it has absorbed enough blood to begin the test.</p></li>
<li><p class="">View your test result and take the proper steps if your blood sugar is high or low, based on your healthcare professionals’ recommendations.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Discard the used lancet properly.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Record the results in a logbook, hold them in the meter's memory or download to an app or computer so you can review and analyze them later.</p></li>

<p class="noindent">Endoscopy means looking inside and typically refers to looking inside the body for medical reasons using an endoscope, an instrument used to examine the interior of a hollow organ or cavity of the body. Unlike most other medical imaging devices, endoscopes are inserted directly into the organ <bold>(<a href="#ch6fig21" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 6.21</a>)</bold>.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch6lev2sec108"><h2 class="title">Laryngoscopy</h2>
<p class="noindent">Laryngoscopy is a visual examination below the back of the throat, where the voice box (larynx) containing the vocal cords is located. It is an effective procedure for discovering the causes of voice and breathing problems, pain in the throat or ear, difficulty in swallowing, narrowing of the throat (strictures or stenosis), and blockages in the airway <bold>(<a href="#ch6fig22" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 6.22</a>)</bold>.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch6lev3sec16"><h3 class="title">Purpose of Laryngoscope</h3>
<p class="noindent">Laryngoscopy is performed to:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Diagnose a persistent cough, throat pain, bleeding, hoarseness, or bad breath</p></li>
<li><p class="">Check for inflammation</p></li>
<li><p class="">Discover a possible narrowing or blockage of the throat</p></li>
<li><p class="">Remove foreign objects</p></li>
<li><p class="">Visualize or biopsy a mass or tumor in the throat or on the vocal cords <bold>(<a href="#ch6fig23" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 6.23</a>)</bold></p></li>
<li><p class="">Diagnose difficulty swallowing</p></li>
<li><p class="">Evaluate causes of persistent earache</p></li>
<li><p class="">Diagnose voice problems, such as weak voice, hoarse voice, breathy voice, or no voice</p></li>

</div>
<div class="section" id="ch6lev3sec17"><h3 class="title">Types of Laryngoscope</h3>
<p class="noindent">The procedure is relatively painless, but the idea of having a scope inserted into the throat can be a little scary, so it helps to understand how a laryngoscopy is done. The following basics will help you understand what is happening and help put your child at ease.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch6lev4sec3"><h4 class="title">Indirect Laryngoscopy (<a href="#ch6fig24" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 6.24</a>)</h4>
<p class="noindent">The indirect procedure can be performed in the doctor's office using a small hand mirror, which is held at the back of the throat. The doctor will aim a light at the back of the throat, usually by wearing headgear that has a bright light attached. This technique will help the doctor examine the larynx, vocal cords, and hypopharynx, which is a part of the passageway to the lungs and stomach. Indirect laryngoscopy is not typically used with children, as it tends to cause gagging and can be hard for kids to tolerate.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch6lev4sec4"><h4 class="title">Fiberoptic (flexible) laryngoscopy/Direct laryngoscopy</h4>
<p class="noindent">Fiberoptic or direct laryngoscopy examinations allow doctors to see deeper into the throat by using either a flexible or rigid telescope. Rigid telescopes are more often used as part of a surgical procedure in evaluating children with <bold>stridor</bold> (a noisy, harsh breathing) and removing foreign objects in the throat and lower airway. They are also used in collecting tissue samples (<bold>biopsy</bold>), laser treatments, and in locating cancer of the larynx.</p>
<p class="indent"><bold><a href="#ch6fig25" class="ulink-inter">Figure 6.25</a></bold> depicts the indirect oral laryngoscopy and indirect nasal laryngoscopy.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch6lev4sec5"><h4 class="title">During the Procedure</h4>
<p class="noindent">Indirect laryngoscopy and fiberoptic laryngoscopies often are performed in the doctor's office, usually using local anesthetic. These procedures usually take only 5 to 10 minutes.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch6lev4sec6"><h4 class="title">Indirect Laryngoscopy</h4>
<p class="noindent">The patient will be asked to sit up straight in a high-backed chair with a headrest. The chair will allow your child's head and jaw to move forward. The patient will open his/her mouth wide, and the doctor will spray the throat with an anesthetic or numbing medication. The patient will gargle and then spit out. The doctor will then cover the tongue with gauze and hold it down. The doctor will hold up a warm mirror to the back of the throat. With a light that is usually attached to headgear the doctor is wearing, the doctor will tilt the mirror to view various areas of the throat. The patient may be asked to make high-pitched or low-pitched sounds so that the doctor can view the larynx and see the vocal cords move.</p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="ch6lev4sec7"><h4 class="title">Fiberoptic Laryngoscopy</h4>
<p class="noindent">In a fiberoptic laryngoscopy, the doctor will use a fiberoptic laryngoscope, which is a thin, flexible instrument that lights and magnifies images, providing a better view of the larynx and vocal cords. The doctor will determine if this procedure is to be done in the operating room under general anesthesia or in the office. The procedure typically does not require a hospital stay. Sometimes numbing medication is sprayed or swabbed in the nose or throat before the procedure. The flexible scope will be inserted through the nostril or the mouth. The doctor will examine the throat area through the scope's eyepiece. Sometimes the images are displayed on a monitor so that family members can see what the doctor is seeing. <bold><a href="#ch6fig26" class="ulink-inter">Figure 6.26</a></bold> showing the laryngoscopy examination (fiberoptic larynscope) for child.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch6lev4sec8"><h4 class="title">Direct Laryngoscopy</h4>
<p class="noindent">Direct laryngoscopy is done in an operating room and your child will be put under general anesthesia and not feel the scope in his/her throat. Before the direct laryngoscopy procedure, the patient has to remove all jewelry and eyeglasses. The patient will be asked to empty his/her bladder and then to change into a cloth or paper gown, which will be provided.<a name="page248"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">248</span></span></p>
<div class="figure" id="ch6fig26" data-label="Fig. 6.26"><div class="title"><span class="item-label">Fig. 6.26</span> Laryngoscopy examination for child.</div><img alt="Fig. 6.26" src="/MediumImage/248-1.jpg"><div class="additional-markup"></div></div>
<p class="indent">Inside the operating room, the client will lie on his/her back and the laryngoscope will be placed through the mouth, into the throat. IV fluids and medications, such as antibiotics or steroids, may be administered. If needed, the doctor will remove foreign objects in the throat, collect tissue samples, perform laser treatment, or remove growths from the vocal cords. The examination can take as little as 15 to 30 minutes, but may take much longer if specific treatments are required.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch6lev3sec18"><h3 class="title">After the Procedure</h3>
<p class="noindent">If a local anesthetic or topical numbing spray was used during the examination, it will wear off in about 30 minutes. The client should not eat or drink anything for about 2 hours, until the spray has worn off and the throat is no longer numb.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch6lev4sec9"><h4 class="title">Direct Laryngoscopy</h4>
<p class="noindent">After a direct laryngoscopy, your child will be watched by a nurse until fully awake and able to swallow. This usually takes about 2 hours. In some cases, an overnight hospital stay may be required. The client may have some nausea, general muscle aches, and feel tired for a day or two. Gargling and sucking on throat lozenges will help with the soreness, and pain medication will be given, if needed. The client may sound hoarse or have noisy breathing for a few days after the procedure. This is normal. If the hoarseness persists, or your child is having difficulty breathing, check with doctor.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch6lev4sec10"><h4 class="title">Benefits</h4>
<p class="noindent">Laryngoscopy is one of the best ways to find and treat the causes of voice or breathing problems, difficulty swallowing, persistent sore throats or hoarseness, or trouble with vocal cords. Laryngoscopy is also an excellent way to retrieve foreign objects from the throat, windpipe, or lungs, or clear blockages in the airway.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch6lev4sec11"><h4 class="title">Risks and Complications</h4>
<p class="noindent">Laryngoscopy is considered an extremely effective medical exam.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch6lev4sec12"><h4 class="title">Anesthesia</h4>
<p class="noindent">In some cases, anesthesia medications can cause complications in children, such as irregular heartbeats and breathing problems. These complications are not common. Allergic reactions also are not common. If they do occur, they typically develop within a few minutes after the anesthesia is given. The doctors can provide immediate medical attention if that happens.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Blocked airway:</bold> Inserting a laryngoscope down the throat has the potential to cause swelling of the airways and breathing difficulties. Sometimes the airway is already blocked by the foreign body or condition that caused the problem in the first place. In very rare cases, doctors may need to perform a tracheotomy (a small incision made in the neck and windpipe, or trachea) to allow air into the lungs.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Bleeding or infection:</bold> If a biopsy was taken, there is the rare possibility of bleeding or infection at the site.</p></li>

<p class="noindent">Colonoscopy is a procedure that enables an examiner (usually a gastroenterologist) to evaluate the inside of the colon (large intestine or large bowel). The colonoscope is a four foot long, flexible tube about the thickness of a finger with a camera and a source of light at its tip. The tip of the colonoscope is inserted into the anus and then is advanced slowly, under visual control, into the rectum and through the colon usually as far as the cecum, which is the first part of the colon.</p>

<p class="noindent">The patient assumes left lateral position ask him to relax as much as possible. The client is usually given (IV) sedation with valium, Demerol vessel. The lubricated colonoscope is inserted into the anus. A small amount of air is instilled to help the physician visualize the bowel lumen. When the colonoscope reaches the sigmoid junction, the client may move to the supine position making it easier to advance the colonoscope past the splenic flexure. During the test, encourage the client to relax. Monitor the vital signs throughout the procedure watching for a vasovagal response teaching to hypotension and bradycardia.</p>

<p class="noindent">There are two types of sigmoidoscope that can be used. The most commonly used is the flexible sigmoidoscope. This instrument allows your doctor to see around bends in the colon. A flexible sigmoidoscope gives doctors a better view of the lower colon and usually makes the examination more comfortable. The rigid sigmoidoscope has generally been replaced by the flexible version and is now used less often. It allows your doctor to look into the rectum and the bottom part of the colon but it does not reach as far into the colon as the flexible sigmoidoscope.</p>

<p class="noindent">Laparoscopy is a procedure through which the abdominal and pelvic organs are visualized by means of a laparoscope. Laparoscopes are rigid telescope varying in diameter incorporating an optical system with a system of illumination. A variety of ancillary instruments, such as punch biopsy forceps, hook scissors, coagulation points, diathermy points, knives, probes, traumatic forceps, etc., are used with the laparoscopes. These instruments are used for measurements, aspirations, biopsies, dividing adhesions, coagulations, tubal ligations and operations.</p>

<div class="section" id="ch6lev3sec56"><h3 class="title">Definition</h3>
<p class="noindent">Laparoscopy is a minimally invasive procedure used as a diagnostic tool and surgical procedure that is performed to examine the abdominal and pelvic organs, or the thorax, head, or neck. Tissue samples can also be collected for biopsy using laparoscopy and malignancies treated when it is combined with other therapies. Laparoscopy can also be used for some cardiac and vascular procedures.<a name="page255"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">255</span></span></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch6lev3sec57"><h3 class="title">Indication</h3>
<p class="noindent">Laparoscopy may be performed to diagnose variety of conditions. A laparoscopy is safe and convenient procedure with the added benefits of being usable for outpatients having a short postoperative period and minimal incision scarring. It may be used for the following:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">To diagnose ectopic pregnancy, follicular activity in the ovaries in case of sterility, pelvic masses, pelvic conditions, such as endometriosis, adhesions, tubal occlusions, etc.</p></li>
<li><p class="">To diagnose conditions that is affecting the uterus, bladder and cul-de-sac.</p></li>
<li><p class="">To find out the etiology of abdominal and pelvic pains, endocrinopathies and/or amenorrhea.</p></li>
<li><p class="">To take a biopsy from any part of the abdominal area.</p></li>
<li><p class="">To do tubal sterilization by electrocoagulation.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch6lev3sec58"><h3 class="title">Types of Laparoscope</h3>
<p class="noindent">There are two types of laparoscope—(1) a telescopic rod lens system, that is usually connected to a video camera (single chip or three chip), or (2) a digital laparoscope where a miniature digital video camera is placed at the end of the laparoscope, eliminating the rod lens system.</p>
<p class="indent">The mechanism mentioned in the second type is mainly used to improve the image quality of flexible endoscopes replacing traditional fiberscopes. Nevertheless, laparoscopes are rigid endoscopes. The rigidness is required in clinical practice. The rod lens-based laparoscopes are highly dominant in practice, due to their fine optical resolution (50 um typically, dependent on the aperture size used in the objective lens), and the image quality can be better than the digital cameras if necessary. The second type is very rare in the laparoscope market and hospitals.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch6lev3sec59"><h3 class="title">Procedure</h3>
<p class="noindent">Laparoscopy is typically performed in the hospital under general anesthesia, although some laparoscopic procedures can be performed using local anesthetic agents. Once under anesthesia, a urinary catheter is inserted into the patient's bladder for urine collection. To begin the procedure, a small incision is made just below the navel and a cannula or trocar is inserted into the incision to accommodate the insertion of the laparoscope. Other incisions may be made in the abdomen to allow the insertion of additional laparoscopic instrumentation. A laparoscopic insufflation device is used to inflate the abdomen with carbon dioxide gas to create a space in which the laparoscopic surgeon can maneuver the instruments. After the laparoscopic diagnosis and treatment are completed, the laparoscope, cannula, and other instrumentation are removed, and the incision is sutured and bandaged. <bold><a href="#ch6fig36" class="ulink-inter">Figure 6.36</a></bold> depicts the tubing placement techniques in laparoscopic procedure.</p>
<div class="figure" id="ch6fig36" data-label="Fig. 6.36"><div class="title"><span class="item-label">Fig. 6.36</span> Laparoscopic tubing placement techniques.</div><img alt="Fig. 6.36" src="/MediumImage/255-1.jpg"><div class="additional-markup"></div></div>

<p class="indent">Laparoscopes have integral cameras for transmitting images during the procedure, and are available in various sizes depending upon the type of procedure performed. The images from the laparoscope are transmitted to a viewing monitor that the surgeon uses to visualize the internal anatomy and guide any surgical procedure. Video and photographic equipment are also used to document the surgery, and may be used postoperatively to explain the results of the procedure to the patient. <bold><a href="#ch6fig37" class="ulink-inter">Figure 6.37</a></bold> shows the laparoscopic procedure for uterine repair.</p>
<p class="indent">Robotic systems are available to assist with laparoscopy. A robotic arm, attached to the operating table may be used to hold and position the laparoscope. This serves to reduce unintentional camera movement that is common when a surgical assistant holds the laparoscope. The surgeon controls the robotic arm movement by foot pedal with voice-activated command, or with a handheld control panel. Microlaparoscopy has become more common over the past few years.<a name="page256"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">256</span></span></p>
<p class="indent">The procedure involves the use of smaller laparoscopes (that is, 2 mm compared to 5–10 mm for hospital laparoscopy), with the patient undergoing local anesthesia with conscious sedation (during which the patient remains awake but very relaxed) in a physician's office. Video and photographic equipment, previously explained, may be used.</p>
<p class="indent">Laparoscopy has been explored in combination with other therapies for the treatment of certain types of malignancies, including pelvic and aortic lymph node dissection, ovarian cancer, and early cervical cancer. Laparoscopic radiofrequency ablation is a technique whereby laparoscopy assists in the delivery of radiofrequency probes that distribute pulses to a tumor site. The pulses generate heat in malignant tumor cells and destroy them. The introduction of items such as temperature-controlled instruments, <bold>surgical instruments</bold> with greater rotation and articulation, improved imaging systems, and multiple robotic devices will expand the utility of laparoscopic techniques in the future. The skills of surgeons will be enhanced as well with further development of training simulators and computer technology. <bold><a href="#ch6fig38" class="ulink-inter">Figure 6.38</a></bold> shows the video-assisted laparoscopic surgery.</p>

Instead of producing a signal, still image, a fluoroscopy screen registers a constant image of the chest (or other part body) being examined. This makes, if possible for the chest and intrathoracic structures to be observed while they function dynamically. Fluoroscopy is not used routinely but rather in those situations in which continual observation of the thorax in an advantage (e.g., to observe the transbronchial passage of biopsy forceps during a bronchoscopy).</p>

<div class="section" id="ch6lev3sec75"><h3 class="title">Procedure</h3>
<p class="noindent">Fluoroscopy is a study of moving body structures—similar to an X-ray “movie.” A continuous X-ray beam is passed through the body part being examined. The beam is transmitted to a TV-like monitor so that the body part and its motion can be seen in detail. Fluoroscopy, as an imaging tool, enables physicians to look at many body systems, including the skeletal, digestive, urinary, respiratory, and reproductive systems. Fluoroscopy may be performed to evaluate specific areas of the body, including the bones, muscles, and joints, as well as solid organs, such as the heart, lung, or kidneys. Other related procedures that may be used to diagnose problems of the bones, muscles, or joints include X-rays, myelography (myelogram), computed tomography (CT scan), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and arthrography. Please see these procedures for additional information.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch6lev3sec76"><h3 class="title">Before the Procedure</h3>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">The doctor will explain the procedure to you and offer you the opportunity to ask any questions that you might have about the procedure.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The client may be asked to sign a consent form that gives your permission to do the procedure. Read the form carefully and ask questions if something is not clear.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The specific type of procedure or examination being done will determine whether any preparation prior to the procedure is required. Your doctor will notify you of any preprocedure instructions.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Notify your doctor if you have ever had a reaction to any contrast dye, or if you are allergic to iodine.</p></li>
<li><p class="">If the client is pregnant or suspect that should notify your doctor</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch6lev3sec77"><h3 class="title">After the Procedure</h3>
<p class="noindent">The type of care required after the procedure will depend on the type of fluoroscopy that is performed. Certain procedures, such as cardiac catheterization, will likely require a recovery period of several hours with immobilization of the leg or arm where the cardiac catheter was inserted. Other procedures may require less time for recovery. If you notice any pain, redness, and/or swelling at the IV site after you return home following your procedure, you should notify your doctor as this could indicate an infection or other type of reaction.</p>

<div class="section" id="ch6lev2sec115"><h2 class="title">Funduscopy (<a href="#ch6fig44" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 6.44</a>)</h2>
<p class="noindent">The retina is the only portion of the central nervous system visible from the exterior. Likewise the fundus is the only location where vasculature can be visualized. So much of what we see in internal medicine is vascular related and so viewing the fundus is a great way to get a sense for the patient's overall vasculature. But the fundoscopic exam can discover pathological process otherwise invisible, examples are plentiful, and include recognizing endocarditis, disseminated candidemia, CMV in an HIV infected patient, and being able to stage both diabetes and hypertension.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Large/Medium/Small light source:</bold> Ophthalmoscopes usually have 2 or 3 sizes of light to use depending on the level of pupil dilation. The small light is used when the pupil is very constricted (i.e., well lit room, no pupil dilators used). The large light is best if using mydriatic eye drops to dilate. Most commonly in a dark, non-dilated pupil, the medium sized light is used.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Half-light:</bold> If, for example, the pupil is partially obstructed by a lens with cataracts, the half circle can be used to pass light through only the clear portion of the pupil to avoid light reflecting back</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Red free:</bold> Used to visualize the vessels and hemorrhages in better detail by improving contrast. This setting will make the retina look black and white.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Slit beam:</bold> Used to examine contour abnormalities of the cornea, lens and retina.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Blue light:</bold> Some ophthalmoscopes have this feature that can be used to observe corneal abrasions and ulcers after fluorescein staining.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Grid</bold>: Used to make rough approximations of relative distance between retinal lesions.</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="ch6lev3sec78"><h3 class="title">Types of Funduscopy</h3>
<p class="noindent">Each type of ophthalmoscopy has a special type of ophthalmoscope:</p>
<p class="indent">The direct ophthalmoscope is an instrument about the size of a small flashlight (torch) with several lenses that can magnify up to about 15 times. This type of ophthalmoscope is most commonly used during a routine physical examination.<a name="page260"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">260</span></span></p>
<p class="indent">An indirect ophthalmoscope, on the other hand, constitutes a light attached to a headband, in addition to a small handheld lens. It provides a wider view of the inside of the eye. Furthermore, it allows a better view of the fundus of the eyes; even if the lens is clouded by cataracts An indirect ophthalmoscope can be either monocular or binocular. It is used for peripheral viewing of the retina.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch6lev3sec79"><h3 class="title">Technique</h3>
<div class="section" id="ch6lev4sec21"><h4 class="title">Traditional Direct Ophthalmoscope</h4>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Darken room, ask patient to look at the same point as far as possible in the room (this will help to dilate the pupil).</p></li>
<li><p class="">Wedge scope against your cheek with hand and then head/hand/scope should move as one unit.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Use your right hand and your right eye to look at the patient's right eye.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Look through the ophthalmoscope, if you are nearsighted and have taken off your glasses, you may need to adjust the focusing wheel towards the negative/red until what you see at a distance is in focus.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Finding the retina:</bold> Direct the ophthalmoscope 15° from center and look for the red reflex. Simply follow the red reflex in until you see the retina. If you lose the red reflex, come back until you find it again and repeat.</p></li>
<li><p class="">To look around the retina using a traditional direct ophthalmoscope, you should “pivot” the ophthalmoscope, angling up, down, left and right.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch6lev4sec22"><h4 class="title">PanOptic Ophthalmoscope</h4>
<p class="noindent">Although the PanOptic is very similar to the traditional ophthalmoscope, there are a number of differences. Additionally, the view of the PanOptic is 4–5 x wider.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Use the scope to view an object approximately 15 feet away and adjust the focus until clear (unless you are wearing glasses and are taking them off, you will likely be in perfect focus at a setting of zero). (You will NOT need to use your right eye, patient's right eye and your right hand as usually instructed with the traditional ophthalmoscope. You can hold the panoptic however you are most comfortable.)</p></li>
<li><p class="">Darken room, ask patient to look at the same point as far as possible in the room (this will help to dilate the pupil).</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Finding the retina:</bold> Stand back! Direct the ophthalmoscope 15° from center and look for the red reflex. Simply follow the red reflex in until you see the retina. If you lose the red reflex, come back until you find it again and repeat.</p></li>
<li><p class="">To see other regions around the retina, rather than angling the ophthalmoscope, you simply ask the patient to look up to see the upper retina, down to see the lower retina, medial to see the medial retina, lateral to see the lateral retina and to look towards the light to see the macula.</p></li>

<p class="noindent">Esophagogastroscopy includes gastroscopy and esophagoscopy. If duodenoscopy is included with the endoscopic examination, the term is esophagogastroduodenoscopy. A flexible fiberoptic endoscope is used for direct visualization of the internal structures of the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. Biopsy forceps or a cytology brush can also be inserted through a channel of the endoscope. Suction can be applied for the removal of secretions and foreign bodies.</p>

<p class="indent">This test is performed under local anesthesia or IV sedation (benzodiazepine or narcotics), in a gastroscopy room of a hospital or clinic, usually by a gastroenterologist. This procedure can be done on an emergency basis for removal of foreign objects (a bone, a pin, etc.) and for diagnostic purposes. The major complications that can occur from esophagogastroduodenoscopy are perforation and hemorrhage.</p>

<p class="noindent">Bronchography is a radiological technique, which involves X-raying the respiratory tree after coating the airways with contrast bronchography is rarely performed, as it has been made obsolete with improvements in computerized tomography and bronchoscope.</p>
<p class="indent">A bronchography is a radiographic (X-ray) examination of the interior passageways of the lower respiratory tract. The structures of the lower respiratory tract, which include the larynx (voice box), trachea (windpipe), and bronchi (larger branching airways to the lungs), become visible on X-ray film after contrast dye is instilled through either a catheter or bronchoscope (narrow, flexible, lighted tube) into these areas.<a name="page264"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">264</span></span> Contrast dye is a substance that causes a particular organ, tissue, or structure to be more visible on X-ray or other diagnostic images.</p>

<p class="indent">The contrast dye is released as the catheter or bronchoscope is inserted through the nose or mouth and advanced down the throat into the trachea and bronchi. The contrast dye forms a coating on the lining of the interior walls of these structures, thus outlining their anatomy on X-ray. In addition, abnormalities such as tumors, cavities, cysts, and obstructions may be revealed. As a result of improved computerized tomography (CT scan) and bronchoscopy technology, as well as increased availability of these procedures, bronchography is performed on an infrequent basis.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch6lev3sec95"><h3 class="title">Reasons for the Procedure</h3>
<p class="noindent">A bronchography may be performed to diagnose structural or functional abnormalities of the larynx, trachea, and/or bronchi. Abnormalities may include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Bronchiectasis—an irreversible enlargement of the bronchi as a result of deterioration of the muscle and elastic tissue of the bronchial walls. Generally, this is the result of chronic inflammation from various causes.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Hemoptysis—coughing up blood</p></li>
<li><p class="">Tracheoesophageal fistula—abnormal tract between trachea (windpipe) and esophagus (hollow tube used for swallowing)</p></li>

<div class="section" id="ch6lev2sec119"><h2 class="title">Angiography</h2>
<p class="noindent">Angiography is the roentgenographic visualization of the blood vessels anywhere in the body following the injection of a contrast medium. It is useful in evaluating the disorders of the brain, heart, lungs and other body segments.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch6lev3sec96"><h3 class="title">Meaning</h3>
<p class="noindent">It is the study of the chambers of the heart and the large thoracic blood vessels done in conjunction with the cardiac catheterization. Immediately after the dye is injected, a series of X-ray films are taken which will reveal the course of the dye as it circulates through the client's heart, lungs and great blood vessels.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch6lev3sec97"><h3 class="title">Purposes</h3>
<p class="noindent">The purposes of the angiocardiography is:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">To check the valves of the heart for competence.</p></li>
<li><p class="">To diagnose congenital septal defects.</p></li>
<li><p class="">To reveal calcifications or occlusions of the coronary arteries.</p></li>
<li><p class="">To study the structure and functions of the heart in detail prior to cardiac surgery.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch6lev3sec98"><h3 class="title">Procedure</h3>
<p class="noindent">Angiography is sometimes called conventional angiography to distinguish it from CT angiography (CTA) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). Angiography provides detailed images of blood vessels, commonly those in the heart, lungs, brain, and legs. Angiography can provide still images or motion pictures (called cineangiography). IV contrast is injected through a catheter inserted into a blood vessel that connects with the vessel to be imaged. A local anesthetic or a sedative may be used. If the catheter is inserted into an artery, the insertion site must be steadily compressed for 10 to 20 minutes after all instruments are removed to reduce the risk of bleeding at the puncture site. Patients may also need to lie flat for several hours or be hospitalized to reduce this risk.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch6lev3sec99"><h3 class="title">Types of Angiography</h3>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Pulmonary angiography:</bold> Pulmonary angiography is the roentgenographic visualization of the blood vessels of the lungs. It is helpful in diagnosing such conditions as pulmonary embolism, lung tumors, aneurisms, vascular changes associated with emphysema, congenital defects, space occupying lesions within the thorax. Like angio-cardiography, the pulmonary angiography also involves the cardiac catheterization.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Cerebral angiography:</bold> A cerebral angiography allows X-ray visualization of the brain's vascular system. The dye may be injected directly into the common carotid artery (percutaneous carotid arteriogram) or with the insertion of a catheter into the brachial artery or femoral artery to the descending aorta and from there into the desired vessels of the heart. Once the appropriate vessel has been reached, the contrast material is injected and a series of films are rapidly taken.<a name="page265"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">265</span></span></p></li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent"><bold>Common uses of conventional angiography include the following:</bold></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Coronary angiography is usually done before percutaneous or surgical interventions involving the coronary arteries or heart valves. It is usually done with cardiac catheterization.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Cerebral angiography may be indicated after stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA), e.g., if stenting or carotid endarterectomy is being considered.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Iliac and femoral angiography may be indicated before interventions to treat peripheral arterial disease.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Aortography is sometimes done to diagnose and provide anatomic detail about aortic aneurysms, aortic dissection, and aortic regurgitation.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Angiography of the eye arteries can be done using fluorescein dye.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Conventional pulmonary angiography used to be the gold standard for diagnosis of pulmonary embolism; now, it has largely been replaced by CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA), which is less invasive.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">Conventional angiography is usually done before therapeutic angiographic procedures, such as angioplasty, vascular stenting, and embolization of tumors and vascular malformations.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch6lev3sec100"><h3 class="title">Disadvantages</h3>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">The injection site may bleed if the injected blood vessel ruptures; a painful hematoma can form. Rarely, the site becomes infected; it becomes red and swollen and exudes a purulent discharge within a few days after the injection.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Rarely, an artery is injured by the catheter, or an atherosclerotic plaque dislodges, causing an embolism distally. Very rarely, shock, seizures, renal failure, and cardiac arrest occur.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Risk of complications is higher in the elderly, although it is still low. The radiation dose used in angiography can vary and be significant (e.g., coronary angiography is associated with an effective radiation dose of 4.6 to 15.8 mSv). Angiography must be done by highly skilled physicians, usually specially trained interventional radiologists or cardiologists.</p></li>

<div class="section" id="ch6lev2sec120"><h2 class="title">Pulmonary Angiography (<a href="#ch6fig51" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 6.51</a>)</h2>
<p class="noindent">Pulmonary angiography is a procedure that uses a special dye (contrast material) and X-rays to see how blood flows through the lungs. Angiography is an imaging test that uses X-rays and a special dye to see inside the arteries. Arteries are blood vessels that carry blood away from the heart.</p>
<p class="noindent">This test is done in a special unit of a hospital. You will be asked to lie on an X-ray table.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Before the test starts, you will be given a mild sedative to help you relax.</p></li>
<li><p class="">An area of your body, usually the arm or groin, is cleaned and numbed with a local numbing medicine (anesthetic).</p></li>
<li><p class="">The radiologist inserts a needle or makes a small cut in a vein in the area that has been cleaned, and inserts a thin hollow tube called a catheter.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The catheter is placed through the vein and carefully moved up into and through the right-sided heart chambers and into the pulmonary artery, which leads to the lungs. The doctor can see live X-ray images of the area on a TV-like monitor, and use them as a guide.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Once the catheter is in place, dye is injected into the catheter. X-ray images are taken to see how the dye moves through the lungs’ arteries. The dye helps detect any blockages to blood flow.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Your pulse, blood pressure, and breathing are monitored during the procedure. Electrocardiogram (ECG) leads are taped to your arms and legs to monitor your heart.</p></li>
<li><p class="">After the X-rays are taken, the needle and catheter are removed.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Pressure is immediately applied to the puncture site for 20–45 minutes to stop the bleeding. After that time, the area is checked and a tight bandage is applied. The leg should be kept straight for 6 hours after the procedure.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Rarely, this test can be used to deliver medications to the lungs when a blood clot has been found.</p></li>

<p class="noindent">Lower extremity venography is a test used to see the veins in the leg. X-rays are a form of electromagnetic radiation like light, but of higher energy, so they can go through the body to form an image on film. Structures that are dense (such as bone) will appear white, air will be black, and other structures will be shades of gray. Veins are not normally seen in an X-ray, so a special dye (called contrast) is used to highlight them.</p>
<p class="indent">Leg venography, also called lower extremity venography or phlebography, offers a way for doctors to see the veins in your legs. Veins do not normally show up on X-rays. In a venogram, a doctor injects a special kind of dye into your veins. This dye, called <bold>contrast material</bold>, is visible on X-rays, and enables your doctor to take images of the veins in your leg.</p>

<p class="noindent">Cholecystography, X-ray of the gallbladder and biliary channels, following the administration of a radiopaque dye, one of the techniques of diagnostic imaging. In oral cholecystography, the dye is ingested, absorbed by the intestine, and concentrated by the gallbladder, which normally appears well opacified in the X-ray. Abnormalities (e.g., gallstones) may be demonstrated by radiolucent areas. Oral cholecystography is usually indicated in cases of suspected gallbladder disease.<a name="page273"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">273</span></span></p>
<p class="indent">Newer dyes that permit visualization of the bile channels without concentration by the gallbladder are administered intravenously to determine or rule out the presence of intermittent obstruction of the bile ducts or recurrent biliary disease after biliary surgery.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch6lev3sec140"><h3 class="title">Definition</h3>
<p class="noindent">A cholecystogram is an X-ray procedure used to help evaluate the gallbladder. For the procedure, a special diet is consumed prior to the test and contrast tablets are also swallowed to help visualize the gallbladder on X-ray. The test is used to help in diagnosing disorders of the liver and gallbladder, including gallstones and tumors.</p>
<p class="noindent"><bold>Oral cholecystography</bold> is a procedure used to visualize the gallbladder by administering, by mouth, a radiopaque contrast agent that is excreted by the liver. This excreted material will collect in the gallbladder, where reabsorption of water concentrates the excreted contrast. Since only 10% of gallstones are radiopaque, the remaining 90% will appear as translucent on an opaque background in an abdominal X-ray. Current medical practice prefers ultrasound and CT over oral cholecystography. If needed, IV cholecystography and cholangiography may be done.</p>

<div class="section" id="ch6lev2sec130"><h2 class="title">Intravenous Pyelography</h2>
<p class="noindent">An intravenous pyelogram also called an excretory urogram is an X-ray exam of your urinary tract. An intravenous pyelogram lets your doctor view your kidneys, your bladder and the tubes that carry urine from your kidneys to your bladder (ureters). An intravenous pyelogram may be used to diagnose disorders that affect the urinary tract, such as kidney stones, bladder stones, enlarged prostate, kidney cysts or urinary tract tumors. During an intravenous pyelogram, you will have an X-ray dye (iodine contrast solution) injected into a vein in your arm. The dye flows into your kidneys, ureters and bladder, outlining each of these structures. X-ray pictures are taken at specific times during the exam, so your doctor can clearly see your urinary tract and assess how well it is working.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch6lev3sec160"><h3 class="title">Indications</h3>
<p class="noindent">An intravenous pyelogram may be used to help diagnose conditions that affect the urinary tract, such as:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Kidney stones</p></li>
<li><p class="">Bladder stones</p></li>
<li><p class="">Enlarged prostate</p></li>
<li><p class="">Kidney cysts</p></li>
<li><p class="">Urinary tract tumors</p></li>
<li><p class="">Structural kidney disorders, such as medullary sponge kidney—a birth defect of the tiny tubes inside the kidneys</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">In the past, intravenous pyelogram was the most frequently used imaging test for evaluating possible urinary tract disorders. Since the development of kidney (renal) ultrasound and CT scans—which take less time and do not require X-ray dye—use of intravenous pyelograms has become less common. However, an intravenous pyelogram still can be a helpful diagnostic tool, particularly for:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Identifying certain structural urinary tract disorders</p></li>
<li><p class="">Detecting kidney stones</p></li>
<li><p class="">Providing information about urinary tract obstruction</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch6lev3sec161"><h3 class="title">Risk Factors</h3>
<p class="noindent">In some people, the injection of X-ray dye can cause side effects, such as:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">A feeling of warmth or flushing</p></li>
<li><p class="">A metallic taste in the mouth</p></li>
<li><p class="">Lightheadedness</p></li>
<li><p class="">Nausea</p></li>
<li><p class="">Itching</p></li>
<li><p class="">Hives</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent"><bold>Rarely, severe reactions to the dye occur, including:</bold></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Extremely low blood pressure</p></li>
<li><p class="">A sudden, full-body allergic reaction that can cause breathing difficulties and other life-threatening symptoms (anaphylactic shock)</p></li>
<li><p class="">Cardiac arrest</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div><div class="section" id="ch6lev1sec26"><h1 class="title">CONCLUSION</h1>
<p class="noindent">Proper sample collection and handling is an integral part of obtaining a valid and timely laboratory test result. Specimens must be obtained using proper phlebotomy techniques, collected in the proper container, correctly labeled (in the presence of the patient) and promptly transported to the laboratory. It is the policy of the laboratory to reject samples when there is failure to follow these guidelines. All specimens should be handled with universal precautions, as if they are hazardous and infectious. Careful attention to routine procedures can eliminate most of the errors outlined in this section. Materials provided by the laboratory for specimen collection can maintain the quality of the specimen only when they are used in strict accordance with the instructions provided. All laboratory specimens shall be placed in leak proof containers (i.e., culturettes, vacuum tubes), then bagged in single, biohazard specimen bags. Place the requisition slip in the outside pocket of the biohazard specimen bag.</p>
