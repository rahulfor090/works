</div><div class="section" id="ch10lev1sec2"><h1 class="title">INTRODUCTION</h1>
<p class="noindent">A sensorium (plural: Sensoria) is the sum of an organism's perception, the “seat of sensation” where it experiences and interprets the environments within which it lives. The term originally entered English from the Late Latin in the mid-17th century, from the stem sens- (“sense”). In earlier use it referred, in a broader sense, to the brain as the mind's organ. In medical, psychological, and physiological discourse it has come to refer to the total character of the unique and changing sensory environments perceived by individuals. These include the sensation, perception, and interpretation of information about the world around us by using faculties of the mind such as senses, phenomenal and psychological perception, cognition and intelligence.</p>
</div><div class="section" id="ch10lev1sec3"><h1 class="title">CONCEPT OF SENSORY INTEGRATION (<a href="#ch10fig1" class="ulink-inter">FIG. 10.1</a>)</h1>
<p class="noindent">Sensory integration is the body's ability to take in information from the world around us and to make sense of it. Human beings have seven senses; touch, taste, smell, vision, hearing, proprioception and vestibular. Some individuals have difficulties making sense of the sensory information they receive from their environment and this then impacts upon their ability to function and complete activities successfully.</p>
<div class="figure" id="ch10fig1" data-label="Fig. 10.1"><div class="title"><span class="item-label">Fig. 10.1</span> Concept of sensory integration.</div><img alt="Fig. 10.1" src="/MediumImage/448-1.jpg"><div class="additional-markup"></div></div>
<p class="indent">Some of the defining characteristics of impaired and disturbed sensory and perceptual alterations include the client's changes in terms of behavior, problem solving, sensory sharpness and acuity, and decision making which can lead to the client's restlessness, a lack of orientation, confusion, altered communication, poor concentration, hallucinations, and a lack of focus and attention.</p>
</div><div class="section" id="ch10lev1sec4"><h1 class="title">DEFINITION</h1>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Sensory needs, which can be hearing loss and/or visual impairment or sensory processing difficulties and physical difficulties, can occur for a variety of reasons, e.g. congenital conditions (some progressive), injury or disease. The important consideration in this area is the degree to which the difficulties impact on a child's or young person's ability to access educational opportunities.</p></li>
<li><p class="">North American Nursing Diagnosis Association (NANDA) defined as: Impaired and disturbed sensory perception is “a change in the amount or patterning of incoming stimuli accompanies by a diminished, exaggerated, distorted, or impaired response to such stimuli” as those associated with the client's visual, auditory, tactile, gustatory, olfactory and kinesthetic responses to these stimuli.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Sensorium is the totality of those parts of the brain that receive process and interpret sensory stimuli. The sensorium is the supposed seat of sensation, the place to which impressions from the external world are conveyed and perceived.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Altered sensorium: The term altered sensorium describes limitations on or problems with the brain's ability to receive process or interpret sensory information. Examples of altered sensorium include hallucinatory and confusional states, delirium, coma and sleep.<a name="page449"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">449</span></span></p></li>

</div><div class="section" id="ch10lev1sec5"><h1 class="title">PHYSIOLOGY OF SENSORY SYSTEM</h1>
<p class="noindent">The sensory system is a very important part of human physiology, associated with very peculiar arrangements. Knowledge of this system is essential to differentiate multiple types of sensations. Derangement of these fibers can be associated with a wide range of diseases. While the system is complex, it is vital to have a working knowledge of the structure and operation of the sensory system, to optimize patient care of all kinds.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch10lev2sec1"><h2 class="title">Cellular</h2>
<div class="section" id="ch10lev3sec1"><h3 class="title">Receptors</h3>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Sensory receptors become activated by stimuli in the environment by receiving signals.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The transmission of any message in the neurons of our body requires it to be in the form of an action potential; the sensation must undergo conversion into electrical signals.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The structures which convert mechanical signals into electrical signals are receptors.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Receptors get classified based on the type of stimulus activating them. The following are common types of receptors.</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="ch10lev4sec1"><h4 class="title">Mechanoreceptors</h4>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Activated by changes in pressure</p></li>
<li><p class="">Common mechanoreceptors include</p></li>
<li><p class="">Pacinian corpuscles in the subcutaneous tissue</p></li>
<li><p class="">Meissner corpuscles in nonhairy skin</p></li>
<li><p class="">Baroreceptors in the carotid sinus</p></li>
<li><p class="">Hair cells on the organ of Corti and in the semicircular canals.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch10lev4sec2"><h4 class="title">Photoreceptors</h4>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Activated by light</p></li>
<li><p class="">Rods and cones (located in the retina)
<ul style="list-style-type: square">
<li><p class="">Rods are sensitive to low-intensity light and function better in a dark environment</p></li>
<li><p class="">Cones have a better threshold for light, therefore function well in daylight. They also participate in color vision.</p></li></ul></p></li>
</ul>

<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Activated by chemicals</p></li>
<li><p class="">They serve for olfaction and taste.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch10lev4sec4"><h4 class="title">Thermoreceptors</h4>
<p class="noindent">Located in the skin and include cold and warm receptors. These are present in the skin.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch10lev4sec5"><h4 class="title">Nociceptors</h4>
<p class="noindent">These become activated by extreme pressure, temperature, or noxious chemicals. These are also in the skin.</p>
<p class="noindent">There are different types of receptors present into skin or muscles for all modalities of senses.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch10lev2sec2"><h2 class="title">Touch</h2>
<p class="noindent">Human skin divides into hairy and nonhairy or glabrous skin. This classification is associated with different touch receptors inside the skin. There are four types of touch receptors. Those which are slowly adapting called Merkel cells (slowly adapting type 1) and Ruffini corpuscles (slowly adapting type 2). Those with Pacinian afferents called Pacinian corpuscles and rapidly adaptive ones called Meissner corpuscle.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch10lev2sec3"><h2 class="title">Merkel's Disc</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Structurally simplest among all are Merkel cells which are present in the basal layer of the epidermis.</p></li>
<li><p class="">These are located in nonhairy skin. Present in a high amount at the fingertips, they are sensitive selectively to the particular component of stress or strain, and because of that they are more selective in detecting corners, edges and curvatures; this is useful for reading Braille, etc.<a name="page450"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">450</span></span></p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch10lev2sec4"><h2 class="title">Ruffini Nerve Endings</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">These types of receptors are less densely placed and therefore have less sensitivity. These receptors are located in hairy skin.</p></li>
<li><p class="">They are more sensitive to stretch, so become stimulated during stretching of the skin.</p></li>
<li><p class="">An example is stretching during motion and for the direction of force detection, along with muscle spindle for hand shape and finger position perception, etc.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch10lev2sec5"><h2 class="title">Pacinian Corpuscle</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Distributed throughout the palm and finger, the Pacinian corpuscle is the most sensitive receptor type.</p></li>
<li><p class="">These are large, onion-like layered structures enclosing a single nerve ending. Pacinian corpuscles function as a mechanical filter to protect from very large, low-frequency stress during manual labor.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch10lev2sec6"><h2 class="title">Meissner Corpuscle</h2>
<p class="noindent">They are most sensitive to dynamic changes in the skin, and they are relatively insensitive for static changes of the skin.</p>
<p class="noindent">One distinguishing characteristic of each receptor is the degree of adaptation.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">“Very rapidly adapting” such as Pacinian corpuscle</p></li>
<li><p class="">“Rapidly adapting” such as Meissner corpuscle and hair follicles</p></li>
<li><p class="">“Slowly adapting” includes Ruffini corpuscle, Merkel receptors, and tactile discs</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch10lev2sec7"><h2 class="title">Thermal Receptors</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">These are slowly adapting receptors which can detect changes in skin temperature. These may be cold or warm. These receptors have some baseline firing rates.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Cold receptors are sensitive between 10 and 32° C. Firing at a baseline rate during 30 to 35° C, firing rate increases in cold while it decreases when the temperature increases.</p></li>
<li><p class="">In the same way, warm receptors have baseline firing around 38° C and increase with an increase in temperature.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch10lev2sec8"><h2 class="title">Vibration</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Vibration sensations are useful in the performance of balancing tasks, along with proprioception.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Vibrational sense perception is by Pacinian corpuscles and Meissner corpuscles because both of these receptors are sensitive to low-frequency vibrations.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch10lev2sec9"><h2 class="title">Pain</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Noxious stimulation is converted into an electric signal by unencapsulated nerve endings that terminate in the dermis and epidermis.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Noxious stimuli such as intense hot or cold, or long-standing pressure cause activation of free nerve endings; this requires threshold stimulation to activate the endings, but once activated, signals are transmitted continuously.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch10lev2sec10"><h2 class="title">Proprioception</h2>
<p class="noindent">The Golgi tendon organ senses the position of joints and joint movement near attached muscle tendons attached, and by muscle spindles present inside the extrafusal muscle fibers. They fire signals when stretched.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch10lev2sec11"><h2 class="title">Organ Systems Involved</h2>
<div class="section" id="ch10lev3sec2"><h3 class="title">Types of Fibers</h3>
<p class="noindent">Once perceived by the respective receptors, sensations travel in nerve fibers to reach the sensory cortex. Different sensations travel in different nerve fibers. Erlanger and Gasser classified these nerves, for which the two scientists won a Nobel Prize. They differentiated nerve fibers according to their diameter and conduction velocity, which is famously known as the Erlanger-Gasser classification.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Group I or A-alpha fibers: Ia from primary endings of muscle spindles (proprioception); Ib from Golgi tendon organs (proprioception)</p></li>
<li><p class="">Group II or A-beta fibers From secondary endings of muscle spindles (proprioception); from specialized receptors in the skin and deep tissues (touch, pressure)</p></li>
<li><p class="">Group III or A-delta fibers from free and specialized endings in muscle and joints (pain); from the skin (sharp pain, heat, cold, and some touch and pressure); visceral afferents</p></li>
<li><p class="">Group IV or C fibers from skin and muscle (slow-burning pain); visceral pain.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">After receiving changes in the sensory receptors, sensations are carried away by the above type of sensory nerves.</p>
<p class="indent">These sensory nerves emerge from the dorsal root ganglion, which conveys the sensations from the peripheral nervous system to the central nervous system. They are pseudounipolar cells that have one polar fiber, which gets divided into two parts; one receives the changes from sensory receptors, and the other one enters into the spinal cord to terminate over a spinal segment or in the medulla.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch10lev2sec12"><h2 class="title">Mechanism</h2>
<div class="section" id="ch10lev3sec3"><h3 class="title">Pathways</h3>
<p class="noindent">Spinal sensory nerves carrying signals from receptors to the sensory cortex have a particular arrangement in the spinal cord. They transmit signals by two pathways; these are the spinothalamic pathway and the dorsal column pathway.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch10lev4sec6"><h4 class="title">Spinothalamic pathway</h4>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">This is a sensory pathway carrying pain, temperature, touch, and pressure sensations.<a name="page451"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">451</span></span></p></li>
<li><p class="">It divides into the anterior and lateral spinothalamic tracts. The anterior spinothalamic tract transports crude touch sensations and pressure.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The lateral spinothalamic tract is associated with pain and temperature sensations.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Peripheral sensory fibers are first-order neurons. After receiving signals, they enter the spinal cord to end over the respective spinal segment on the same side.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Second-order neurons cross the spinal cord and then ascend on the contralateral side, ending in the thalamus.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch10lev4sec7"><h4 class="title">Dorsal column pathway</h4>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Sensations of touch, vibrations, and proprioceptions, which are carried by the respective sensory nerve, ascends by the dorsal column pathway from the spinal cord to the thalamus.</p></li>
<li><p class="">In contrast to the spinothalamic pathway, the dorsal column pathway does not end over the respective spinal segment.</p></li>
<li><p class="">After entering into the spinal segment, first-order neurons ascend on the same side up to medial lemniscus, where they cross the midline and terminate in the medulla.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Second-order neurons ascend from the medulla, ending on the thalamus. Because they cross at the medial lemniscus, this pathway is also called a medial lemniscus pathway.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch10lev2sec13"><h2 class="title">Sensory Cortex</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Sensory signals from the thalamus are carried by third-order neurons that travel from the internal capsule and end in the sensory cortex in the 4th layer. This is present in the parietal lobe in the postcentral gyrus at Brodmann areas 3, 1 and 2</p></li>
<li><p class="">Area 3 further subdivides into 3a and 3b. As with the motor cortex, sensory information is also topographically represented in the sensory cortex where the foot, leg, trunk, forelimbs, and face are represented from medial to lateral in sequence.</p></li>
<li><p class="">In animal studies, area 3b and area 1 are associated with cutaneous stimuli, while area 3a is associated with proprioception. Area 2 responds to both tactile and proprioception stimuli.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div><div class="section" id="ch10lev1sec6"><h1 class="title">FUNCTIONING OF SENSORY ORGANS</h1>
<p class="noindent">Specific sensory receptors are contained in specific sense organs. Each of the five senses (sight, hearing, smell, taste, and touch) has a specific sense organ associated with it. The most familiar sense organs are the eyes, ears, nose, skin and taste buds. These organs have receptors that can respond to stimuli by producing nerve impulses in a sensory neuron. The receptors convert the energy of a stimulus into electrical energy that can travel in the nervous system <bold>(<a href="#ch10fig2" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 10.2</a>)</bold>.</p>
<div class="figure" id="ch10fig2" data-label="Fig. 10.2"><div class="title"><span class="item-label">Fig. 10.2</span> Functions of five sense organs.</div><img alt="Fig. 10.2" src="/MediumImage/451-1.jpg"><div class="additional-markup"></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ch10lev2sec14"><h2 class="title">Normal Sensation</h2>
<p class="noindent">Normally the nervous system continually receives thousands of bits of information from sensory nerve organs, relays the information through appropriate channels, and integrates the information into a meaningful response. Sensory stimuli reach the sensory organs to elicit an immediate reaction or present information to the brain to be stored for future use. The nervous system must be intact for sensory stimuli to reach appropriate brain centers and for an individual to perceive the sensation. After interpreting the significance of a sensation, the person is then able to react to the stimulus.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch10lev3sec4"><h3 class="title">Eyes—Sight or Ophthalmoception</h3>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">These are the visual sensory organs in our body. These are sensitive to light images.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The eyes vary in color depending upon the amount of melanin present in our body. It helps in the sense of sight by detecting and focusing on the light images.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The iris in the eye is the colored part that controls the size and diameter of the pupil, which directly affects the amount of light entering the eyes.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Behind the lens of the eye lies the vitreous body. It is filled with a gelatinous material called the vitreous humor.</p></li>
<li><p class="">This substance gives shape to the eyeball and also transmits light to the very back of the eyeball, where the retina is found.</p></li>
<li><p class="">This retina contains photoreceptors, which detect light. There are two types of cells present that perform functions distinct from each other. These are Rod and Cones.
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p class=""><bold>Rods:</bold> These sensors function in low light and are found at the edges of the retina. They also aid in peripheral vision.<a name="page452"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">452</span></span></p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Cones:</bold> These types of retinal cells work best in bright light, detecting fine details and color. There are three types of cones for detecting three primary colors of light, namely’blue, red and green. Typically, color blindness occurs when any one of these types of cones are not present.</p></li>
</ol>
</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch10lev3sec5"><h3 class="title">Ears—Hearing or Audioception</h3>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Ears are the auditory sense organs of our body. They help us to perceive sounds. Our auditory system detects vibrations in the air and this is how we hear sounds. This is known as hearing or audio caption.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The ears are divided into three sections, namely, the outer ear, the inner ear, and the middle ear.</p></li>
<li><p class="">All sounds are basically vibrations, so the outer ear transfers these vibrations into the ear canal, where these vibrations are transformed by the brain into meaningful sound.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Apart from hearing, this sense is also important for balancing our body or equilibrium.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch10lev3sec6"><h3 class="title">Tongue—Taste or Gustaoception</h3>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">The tongue helps in perceiving various tastes and flavors. The taste buds are present between the papillae on the tongue—these help in sensing different tastes.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The senses of smell and taste tend to work together. If one could not smell something, they could not taste it either. The sense of taste is also known as gustaoception.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Taste buds on the tongue contain chemoreceptors that work similarly to the chemoreceptors in the nasal cavity.</p></li>
<li><p class="">However, the chemoreceptors in the nose would detect any kind of smell, whereas there are four different types of taste buds and each one can detect different types of tastes like sweetness, sourness, bitterness and saltiness.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch10lev3sec7"><h3 class="title">Nose—Smell or Olfalcoception</h3>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">The nose is an olfactory organ. Our olfactory system helps us to perceive different smells. This sense of organ also aids our sense of taste. The sense of smell is also known as olfaction.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The olfactory cells tend to line the top of the nasal cavity. On one end, olfactory cells have cilia that project into the nasal cavity and on the other end of the cell, are the olfactory nerve fibers.</p></li>
<li><p class="">As one breathes in, the air enters into the nasal cavity. The olfactory cells are chemoreceptors, which mean that the olfactory cells have protein receptors that can detect subtle differences in chemicals.</p></li>
<li><p class="">These chemicals bind to the cilia, which conducts a nerve impulse that is carried to the brain. The brain then translates these impulses into a meaningful smell.</p></li>
<li><p class="">During a cold, the body produces mucus which blocks the sense of smell; this is the reason why the food which we eat tastes bland.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch10lev3sec8"><h3 class="title">Skin—Touch or Tactioception</h3>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Skin is the largest organ of our body. It is related to the sense of touch. The sense of touch is also referred to as tactioception.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The skin contains general receptors which can detect touch, pain, pressure and temperature.</p></li>
<li><p class="">They are present throughout the skin. Skin receptors generate an impulse, and when activated, is carried to the spinal cord and then to the brain.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch10lev3sec9"><h3 class="title">Other Sense Organs</h3>
<p class="noindent">Besides these five sense organs, there are another two that help to orient us with the world. They are:</p>
<div class="section" id="ch10lev4sec8"><h4 class="title">Vestibular System</h4>
<p class="noindent">The vestibular system acts as a sensory system of the body and is responsible for transmitting information to our brain about the motions, head position and spatial orientation. This system is also involved with motor functions and helps in:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Maintain our body posture.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Maintaining our body balance.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Stabilize our head and body during movement.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Identifying the orientation and posture of our bodies in relation to the environment.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">Thus, the vestibular system is essential for normal movement and equilibrium.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch10lev4sec9"><h4 class="title">Proprioception System</h4>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Proprioception system is described as the conscious or unconscious awareness of joint position.</p></li>
<li><p class="">This system helps the body to identify the muscles, joints and limbs located in 3D space and the direction it is moving in relation to the body.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Walking or kicking without looking at our feet, balancing on one leg, touching the nose with eyes closed and the ability to sense the surface on which we are standing upon, are a few examples of proprioception system.</p></li>
</ul>

</div><div class="section" id="ch10lev1sec7"><h1 class="title">AROUSAL MECHANISM</h1>
<p class="noindent">Arousal is defined as the state of awakening of sense organs up to the point where sensation and perception can take place. There is an activation of various mechanisms, such as reticulate activating system which increases wakefulness, functioning of autonomic nervous system as well as endocrine system. The functioning of these mechanisms also increases ability to respond more quickly and higher alertness.</p>
<p class="indent">The physiological aspect of arousal looks at how wakefulness is achieved through arousal. Research points towards the functioning of ascending reticulate system which consists of a number of neurotransmitters (acetylcholine, norepinephrine, dopamine, histamine, and serotonin). All these neurotransmitters play a crucial role in the arousal activity.<a name="page453"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">453</span></span> There are numerous correlations of arousal which are related to emotional, sexual, mood, sleep, and temperament <bold>(<a href="#ch10fig3" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 10.3</a>)</bold>.</p>

<div class="section" id="ch10lev2sec15"><h2 class="title">Sensory Experience Perception</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Perception simply implies the use of the senses in our possession to gain a better understanding of the world around us.</p></li>
<li><p class="">This processing happens to be done through the organ, usually called “the senses” like hearing, vision, taste, smell, and touch. The sensory perception involves detecting stimuli and subsequently recognizing and characterizing it.</p></li>
<li><p class="">There are five different stimulus types involved in sensory processing viz. chemical, mechanical, electrical, light and temperature.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">The process of sensory perception <bold>(<a href="#ch10fig4" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 10.4</a>)</bold> begins when something in the real world stimulates our sense organs.</p>
<p class="indent">For instance, light reflects off a surface, stimulating our eyes or warmth, emanates from a hot cup of beverage, thereby stimulating our touch senses or the receptors in our skin.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch10lev2sec16"><h2 class="title">Sensory Receptors</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Stimuli in the environment activate specialized receptor cells in the peripheral nervous system.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Different types of stimuli are sensed by different types of receptor cells.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Receptor cells can be classified into types on the basis of three different criteria: Cell type, position, and function.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Receptors can be classified structurally on the basis of cell type and their position in relation to stimuli they sense.</p></li>
<li><p class="">They can also be classified functionally on the basis of the transduction of stimuli, or how the mechanical stimulus, light, or chemical changed the cell membrane potential.<a name="page454"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">454</span></span></p></li>

<div class="section" id="ch10lev2sec17"><h2 class="title">Sensory Reaction</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Reaction time is the time between any kind of event and the response it elicits in a system. The brain is an essential part of developing a quick reaction time.</p></li>
<li><p class="">This information travels from sensory neurons along the optic nerve from the eye to the brain.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The brain processes this information, and then sends a signal through motor neurons down the arm to tell the muscles in the hand to close and catch the ruler.</p></li>
</ul>

</div><div class="section" id="ch10lev1sec9"><h1 class="title">FACTORS INFLUENCING SENSORY FUNCTION</h1>
<p class="noindent">Many factors influence the capacity to receive or perceive stimuli. All are conditions or situations that you manage when delivering care. Some of the risk factors associated with impaired and disturbed sensory and perceptual abilities are impaired sensory processing and the absence of the processing of stimuli secondary to disorders such as blindness, deafness, a loss of taste or smell, and an inability to feel things, some of which can occurs as the result of genetics, aging, trauma, biochemical causes, electrolyte imbalances and excesses of stimulation and deficits in terms of sensory stimulation.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch10lev2sec18"><h2 class="title">Age</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Infants and children are at risk for visual and hearing impairment because of a number of genetic, prenatal, and postnatal conditions.</p></li>
<li><p class="">A concern with high-risk neonates is that early, intense visual and auditory stimulation can adversely affect visual and auditory pathways and alter the developmental course of other sensory organs.</p></li>

<div class="section" id="ch10lev2sec19"><h2 class="title">Meaningful Stimuli</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Meaningful stimuli reduce the incidence of sensory deprivation. In the home meaningful stimuli include pets, music, television, pictures of family members, and a calendar and clock.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The same stimuli need to be present in health care settings. Note whether patients have roommates or visitors. The presence of others offers positive stimulation.</p></li>

</div>
<div class="section" id="ch10lev2sec20"><h2 class="title">Amount of Stimuli</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Excessive stimuli in an environment causes sensory overload. The frequency of observations and procedures performed in an acute health care setting are often stressful.</p></li>

<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">A person's occupation places him or her at risk for hearing, visual, and peripheral nerve alterations.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Individuals who have occupations involving exposure to high noise levels (e.g., factory or airport workers) are at risk for noise-induced hearing loss and need to be screened for hearing impairments.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Hazardous noise is common in work settings and recreational activities. Noisy recreational activities that weakens hearing ability include target shooting and hunting, woodworking, and listening to loud music.</p></li>

<p class="noindent">Sensory-perceptual alteration can be defined as when there is a change in the pattern of sensory stimuli followed by an abnormal response to such stimuli. Such perceptions could be increased, decreased, or distorted with the patient's hearing, vision, touch sensation, smell, or kinesthetic responses to stimuli. Such changes in the pattern of responses to stimuli lead to changes in a patient's behavior, sensory acuity, decision-making process, and problem-solving abilities.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">This can lead to irritability, restlessness, poor concentration, fluctuating mental status, changes in communication due to inattention, and lack of focus. Furthermore, sensory deprivation in isolated patients can lead to anxiety, depression, aggression, hallucinations, and psychotic reactions.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The most common types of sensory alterations are sensory deficits, sensory deprivation, and sensory overload.</p></li>
<li><p class="">When a patient suffers from more than one sensory alteration, the ability to function and relate effectively within the environment is seriously impaired.</p></li>

<div class="section" id="ch10lev2sec32"><h2 class="title">Types of Sensory Alterations</h2>
<p class="noindent">Any alteration in the sensory function affects a person's capacity to connect to and function in an environment severely, known as sensory alterations. Patients who are hospitalized experience sensory alterations owing to change in stimuli loads. The 3 types of sensory alterations are:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p class="">Sensory deficits</p></li>
<li><p class="">Sensory deprivation</p></li>
<li><p class="">Sensory overload</p></li>
</ol>
<div class="section" id="ch10lev3sec10"><h3 class="title">Sensory Deficits</h3>
<p class="noindent">The normal functioning of sensory reception and perception shortfalls and causes sensory deficits, thereby resulting in loss of a person's sense of self with damaged senses. Few examples for sensory deficits are presbyopia, cataracts, dry eyes (sight); presbycusis and cerumen accumulation (hearing); dizziness and disequilibrium (balance); and xerostomia (taste).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch10lev3sec11"><h3 class="title">Sensory Deprivation</h3>
<p class="noindent">An environment with insufficient quality and quantity of stimulation such as repetitive or meaningless stimuli (e.g., hospital environment, with dull meals, limited meaningful touch, and unpleasant environment) leads to sensory deprivation, which is of 3 types: Reduced sensory input; elimination of patterns or meaning from input; and restrictive environments that result in boredom and monotony. Few examples are drowsiness, yawning, impaired memory, boredom, anger, depression, hallucinations, and confusion.<a name="page457"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">457</span></span></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch10lev3sec12"><h3 class="title">Sensory Overload</h3>
<p class="noindent">An environment with multiple stimuli hinders the brain from responding properly or disregarding some stimuli leads to sensory overload. Few examples are pain, dyspnea, and anxiety (internal) and noise, invasive procedures, and strangers’ contact (external).</p>
</div>
</div>
</div><div class="section" id="ch10lev1sec13"><h1 class="title">SENSORY DEFICITS</h1>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">A deficit in the normal function of sensory reception and perception is a sensory deficit.</p></li>
<li><p class="">A person loses a sense of self with impaired senses. Initially he or she withdraws by avoiding communication or socialization with others in an attempt to cope with the sensory loss.</p></li>
<li><p class="">It becomes difficult for the person to interact safely with the environment until he or she learns new skills.</p></li>
<li><p class="">When a deficit develops gradually or when considerable time has passed since the onset of an acute sensory loss, a person learns to rely on unaffected senses.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Some senses may even become more acute to compensate for an alteration. For example, a blind patient develops an acute sense of hearing to compensate for visual loss.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Patients with sensory deficits often change behavior in adaptive or maladaptive ways. For example, a patient with a hearing impairment turns the unaffected ear toward the speaker to hear well, whereas another patient avoids people because he or she is embarrassed about not being able to understand what other people say.</p></li>

<p class="noindent">Sensory overload occurs when the person gets more stimulation than they are able to manage and process; and sensory deprivation occurs when the client does not get enough sensory stimulation to sustain the person in a state of balance. Sensory overload occurs when the client is subjected to an extraordinary amount of internal and external stimuli such as a high level of anxiety and a noisy environment with constant activity as often occurs in emergency departments and critical care areas, respectively.</p>

<p class="noindent">The client affected with sensory overload may exhibit signs and symptoms of sensory overload like anxiety, restlessness, sleep deprivation, disordered thinking and cognitive processes, fatigue, poor problem solving and decision making skills, poor performance, and muscular tension.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">When a person receives multiple sensory stimuli and cannot perceptually disregard or selectively ignore some stimuli, sensory overload occurs.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Excessive sensory stimulation prevents the brain from responding appropriately to or ignoring certain stimuli. Because of the multitude of stimuli leading to overload, a person no longer perceives the environment in a way that makes sense.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Overload prevents meaningful response by the brain; the patient's thoughts race, attention scatters in many directions, and anxiety and restlessness occur.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The amount of stimuli necessary for healthy function varies with each individual. People are often subject to environmental overload more at one time than another.</p></li>
<li><p class="">A person's tolerance to sensory overload varies with level of fatigue, attitude, and emotional and physical well-being.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The acutely ill patient easily experiences sensory overload. The patient in constant pain or who undergoes frequent monitoring of vital signs is at risk.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Multiple stimuli combine to cause overload even if the nurse offers a comforting word or provides a gentle back rub.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Some patients do not benefit from nursing intervention because their attention and energy are focused on more stressful stimuli.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Another example is a patient who is hospitalized in an intensive care unit (ICU), where the activity is constant. Lights are always on.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Patients can hear sounds from monitoring equipment, staff conversations, equipment alarms, and the activities of people entering the unit. Even at night an ICU is very noisy.<a name="page460"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">460</span></span></p></li>
<li><p class="">It is easy to confuse the behavioral changes associated with sensory overload with mood swings or simple disorientation. Look for symptoms such as racing thoughts, scattered attention, restlessness, and anxiety.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Patients in ICU sometimes resort to constantly fingering tubes and dressings. Constant reorientation and control of excessive stimuli become an important part of a patient's care.</p></li>

<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">When conducting an assessment, value the patient as a full partner in planning, implementing, and evaluating care.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Patients are often hesitant to admit sensory losses. Therefore start gathering information by establishing a therapeutic rapport with the patient.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Elicit his or her values, preferences, and expectations with regard to his or her sensory impairment.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Many patients have a definite plan as to how they want their care delivered. Some patients expect caregivers to recognize and appropriately manage and adjust their environment to meet their sensory needs.</p></li>
<li><p class="">This includes helping the patient learn and adapt to a changed lifestyle based on the specific sensory impairment.</p></li>

</div>
<div class="section" id="ch10lev2sec39"><h2 class="title">Persons at Risk</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Older adults are a high-risk group because of normal physiological changes involving sensory organs. However, be careful not to automatically assume that a patient's sensory problem is related to advancing age.</p></li>
<li><p class="">For example, adult sensorineural hearing loss is often caused by exposure to excess and prolonged noise or metabolic, vascular, and other systemic alterations.</p></li>

<div class="section" id="ch10lev2sec40"><h2 class="title">Sensory Alterations History</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">The nursing history includes assessment of the nature and characteristics of sensory alterations or any problem related to an alteration. When taking the history, consider the ethnic or cultural background of the patient because certain alterations are higher in some cultural groups.</p></li>
<li><p class="">During the history it is useful to assess the patient's self-rating for a sensory deficit by asking, “Rate your hearing as excellent, good, fair, poor, or bad.”</p></li>
<li><p class="">Then, based on the patient's self-rating, explore his or her perception of a sensory loss more fully. This provides an in-depth look at how the sensory loss influences the patient's quality of life.</p></li>

<div class="section" id="ch10lev2sec41"><h2 class="title">Mental Status</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Assessment of mental status is valuable when you suspect sensory deprivation or overload. Observation of a patient during history taking, during the physical examination, and while providing nursing care offers valuable data about key patient behaviors and his or her mental status.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Observe the patient's physical appearance and behavior, measure cognitive ability, and assess his or her emotional status.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) is a tool you can use to measure disorientation, change in problem-solving abilities, and altered conceptualization and abstract thinking.</p></li>
<li><p class="">For example, a patient with severe sensory deprivation is not always able to carry on a conversation, remain attentive, or display recent or past memory.</p></li>
<li><p class="">An important step toward preventing cognition-related disability is education by nurses about disease process, available services, and assistive devices.</p></li>

<p class="noindent">Aphasia is loss of the ability to understand or express spoken or written language. It commonly occurs after strokes or traumatic brain injuries. It can also occur in people with brain tumors or degenerative diseases that affect the language areas of the brain. The impact of aphasia on relationships may be profound, or only slight. No two people with aphasia are alike with respect to severity, former speech and language skills, or personality. But in all cases it is essential for the person to communicate as successfully as possible from the very beginning of the recovery process.<a name="page461"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">461</span></span> Below are some suggestions to help communicate with a person with aphasia <bold>(<a href="#ch10fig8" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 10.8</a>)</bold>.</p>
<p class="indent">People who have aphasia have language problems. They may have trouble saying and/or writing words correctly. This type of aphasia is called expressive aphasia. People who have it may understand what another person is saying. If they do not understand what is being said, or if they cannot understand written words, they have what is called receptive aphasia. Some people have a combination of both types of aphasia.</p>
<p class="indent"><bold><a href="#ch10fig9" class="ulink-inter">Figure 10.9</a></bold> depicts the problems of aphasia.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch10lev2sec43"><h2 class="title">Signs and Symptoms of Aphasia</h2>
<p class="noindent">There are ways to communicate with an individual with aphasia and it helps to understand the disorder. There are two broad types of aphasia, called fluent and nonfluent. There are several types of aphasia within those groups but we will just describe these two broad categories to give you a general understanding of the disorder.</p>

<div class="section" id="ch10lev3sec21"><h3 class="title">Fluent Aphasia</h3>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">The most common type of fluent aphasia is called Wernicke's aphasia. People with this disorder can speak, and may do so, but in long sentences that have no meaning. Some may use nonsensical, made-up words.</p></li>
<li><p class="">For example, a person with Wernicke's aphasia may say, “I’m going to that roundered stone to get cream and wind many as you want to go.”</p></li>
<li><p class="">It can also be extremely frustrating for the person suffering from this type of aphasia because they are often unaware of the mistakes in their speech.</p></li>
<li><p class="">They are trying to communicate, not understanding why they cannot be understood.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Also, a person with Wernicke's aphasia may have difficulty understanding another person's speech.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch10lev3sec22"><h3 class="title">Nonfluent Aphasia</h3>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">The most common type of nonfluent aphasia is called Broca's aphasia. People with this type of aphasia may understand another person's speech. However, when they try to communicate, they know what they want to say but their speech may be garbled – and they know it.</p></li>
<li><p class="">They may work very hard to speak in short sentences and when they do, they may eliminate parts of speech like “is”, “the” or “and”.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Instead of saying “I will walk the dog” they may say “walk dog”. Instead of saying “There are two books on the table”, they may say “book, book, two table”.</p></li>
<li><p class="">People with this type of aphasia understand another person's speech.</p></li>
<li><p class="">There is one more common type of aphasia that may present in your patients; global aphasia.</p></li>
<li><p class="">It severely impairs communication. People with global aphasia may have extreme impairments in their ability to speak, or understand language in general.

<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">People require freedom and creativity to construct a sense of self. Language is at the core of this construction. Without language, this process becomes difficult, as the individual cannot inform the world who he or she is, or understand who others are.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Aphasia makes it difficult for the functional mind to be perceived by others. This may lead to an assumption that language loss is the same as cognition loss or lack of capacity.</p></li>
<li><p class="">With capacity hidden, an individual is transformed from a person to a mere physical presence and often viewed as a burden with little social value.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Nurses caring for people with aphasia control conversations and focus dialogue on their own nursing task goals, while patients rarely open discussions and have little influence over topics. This unbalanced communication results in a further reduction of the self and a denial of patients’ rights to participate in their own care or control their own future.</p></li>
<li><p class="">It is essential that nurses get to know the patient as a person, then empower that person to regain the creativity, confidence and freedom required to control their life.</p></li>

<li><p class="">Patients’ immediate concerns are more easily interpreted when relatives are on hand to translate.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Knowledge of the patient's life and views equips family members to act as advocates. However, there are risks to patient autonomy if nurses heavily rely on family members.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Any form of interpretation via a third person increases the chances of misinterpretation. This risk is further increased by relatives’ conscious or subconscious tendency to distort patients’ messages to address their own concerns.</p></li>

No two people with aphasia are alike with respect to severity, former speech and language skills, or personality. But in all cases it is essential for the person to communicate as successfully as possible from the very beginning of the recovery process. Below are some suggestions to help communicate with a person with aphasia.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Make sure you have the person's attention before you start.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Minimize or eliminate background noise (TV, radio, other people).</p></li>
<li><p class="">Keep your own voice at a normal level, unless the person has indicated otherwise.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Keep communication simple, but adult. Simplify your own sentence structure and reduce your rate of speech. Emphasize key words. Don't “talk down” to the person with aphasia.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Give them time to speak. Resist the urge to finish sentences or offer words.<a name="page463"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">463</span></span></p></li>
<li><p class="">Communicate with drawings, gestures, writing and facial expressions in addition to speech.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Confirm that you are communicating successfully with “yes” and “no” questions.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Praise all attempts to speak and downplay any errors. Avoid insisting that each word be produced perfectly.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Engage in normal activities whenever possible. Do not shield people with aphasia from family or ignore them in a group conversation. Rather, try to involve them in family decision-making as much as possible. Keep them informed of events but avoid burdening them with day to day details.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Encourage independence and avoid being overprotective.</p></li>

<p class="noindent">Communication with hospitalized patients is essential to improve the quality and safety of health care. Patients in the ICU are often deprived of speech and their ability to communicate, because of intubation. There is a significant relationship between the loss of speech and severe emotional reactions among ICU patients, such as a high level of frustration, stress, anxiety, and depression. The most commonly used communication methods with critically ill patients, like lip reading, gestures, and head nods are time-consuming, inadequate to meet all communication needs, and frustrating for both patients and nurses. Current practice in the ICU is to use less sedation in mechanically ventilated patients, which increases the number of patients potentially able to communicate while mechanically ventilated and awake.</p>
<p class="noindent">The primary objective of this review is to assess the effectiveness of communication aids for patients requiring an artificial airway (endotracheal or tracheostomy tube), defined as the proportion of patients able to:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Use a non-vocal communication aid to communicate at least one symptom, need or preference; or</p></li>

</div>
<div class="section" id="ch10lev2sec52"><h2 class="title">The Causes of Visual Impairment</h2>
<p class="noindent">Globally the major causes of visual impairment are:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Uncorrected refractive errors (myopia, hyperopia or astigmatism), 43%</p></li>
<li><p class="">Unoperated cataract, 33%</p></li>
<li><p class="">Glaucoma, 2%.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent"><bold>People at risk:</bold> Approximately 90% of visually impaired people live in developing countries.</p>
<p class="noindent"><bold>People aged 50 and over:</bold> About 65% of all people who are visually impaired are aged 50 and older, while this age group comprises about 20% of the world's population. With an increasing elderly population in many countries, more people will be at risk of visual impairment due to chronic eye diseases and aging processes.</p>
<p class="noindent"><bold>Children below age 15:</bold> An estimated 19 million children are visually impaired. Of these, 12 million children are visually impaired due to refractive errors, a condition that could be easily diagnosed and corrected. 1.4 million are irreversibly blind for the rest of their lives and need visual rehabilitation interventions for a full psychological and personal development.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch10lev2sec53"><h2 class="title">Signs of Visual Impairment</h2>
<p class="noindent">Common signs that a child may have a visual impairment include the following.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Eyes that don't move together when following an object or a face</p></li>
<li><p class="">Crossed eyes, eyes that turn out or in, eyes that flutter from side to side or up and down, or eyes that do not seem to focus</p></li>
<li><p class="">Eyes that bulge, dance, or bounce in rapid rhythmic movements</p></li>
<li><p class="">Pupils that are unequal in size or that appear white instead of black</p></li>
<li><p class="">Repeated shutting or covering of one eye (as noticed with Julian)</p></li>
<li><p class="">Unusual degree of clumsiness, such as frequent bumping into things or knocking things over</p></li>
<li><p class="">Frequent squinting, blinking, eye-rubbing, or face crunching, especially when there's no bright light present</p></li>
<li><p class="">Sitting too close to the TV or holding toys and books too close to the face</p></li>
<li><p class="">Avoiding tasks and activities that require good vision</p></li>
<li><p class="">If any of these symptoms are present, parents will want to have their child's eyes professionally examined. Early detection and treatment are very important to the child's development.</p></li>

<div class="section" id="ch10lev2sec54"><h2 class="title">Vision Impairment and Nursing Diagnoses</h2>
<p class="noindent">In assisting residents with these kinds of vision impairments, it is important to plan and also apply certain principles in order for the care to be effective. Vision loss is an hindrance in determining who might be entering the room therefore it is important to knock and identify one's self first before entering. This is to keep the resident informed and be able to know the person coming in. When placing the resident in a room, keep them well-versed of the surroundings and the organization of things inside, in order for the resident to visualize where he is and so he knows where to go and get the things he needs.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch10lev2sec55"><h2 class="title">Nursing Care for Visual Impairment</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">It is really important to pay special attention to impaired vision in nursing care plan. Some residents who still have little vision left need less attention; still the nurse should maintain the right lighting in order for them to use their available vision.</p></li>
<li><p class="">When giving care or doing a procedure to the resident, explain it to them before doing it, in order to keep them aware of what is happening to them and encourage cooperation.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Keep the bed in the lowest position possible, so that visually impaired residents will not have problems in going out of bed when they want to.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Every person has fears of the unknown therefore explain noises that might be heard or sound different.<a name="page465"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">465</span></span></p></li>
<li><p class="">When feeding a resident with vision impairment describe each food and balance the pace of feeding to ensure safety and maintain appetite of the food.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Give assistance while feeding, but also encourage them to be as independent as they can be.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Let the residents feel the light switch before leaving the room so that they will be familiar where to locate it.</p></li>
<li><p class="">When walking with the resident and assisting him, stand next to the resident but slightly be behind them in order to be cautious for possible fall of residents and be able hold them.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Use a gait belt in order to securely hold the resident but make sure that the belt is properly placed around them.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Use devices that can help improve the vision of residents such as magnifying glass, eyeglasses and other reading devices and keep these equipments clean and in perfect condition. Any damage or loss of the devices should be reported to the nurse immediately.</p></li>

<p class="noindent">Hearing loss can be caused by many different causes, some of which can be successfully treated with medicine or surgery, depending on the disease process.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch10lev2sec56"><h2 class="title">Causes</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Exposure to loud noise.</p></li>

<li><p class="">Malformation of the inner ear.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Meniere's disease.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch10lev2sec57"><h2 class="title">Three Types of Hearing Loss</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p class=""><bold>Conductive hearing loss:</bold> When hearing loss is due to problems with the ear canal, ear drum, or middle ear and its little bones (the malleus, incus, and stapes).</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Sensorineural hearing loss:</bold> When hearing loss is due to problems of the inner ear, also known as nerve-related hearing loss.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Mixed hearing loss:</bold> Refers to a combination of conductive and sensorineural hearing loss. This means that there may be damage in the outer or middle ear and in the inner ear (cochlea) or auditory nerve.</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch10lev2sec58"><h2 class="title">Assessment of Hearing</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Rinne's test:</bold> A vibrating tuning fork is placed on the mastoid process of the patient. Instruct him to tell the clinician when he stops hearing. Immediately bring the tuning fork close to his ear and ask whether he can hear the vibrations now. Normally the person can. This is because air conduction of sound is good. This is called Rinne's positive (which is normal). In conduction deafness: Bone conduction is better than air conduction (Rinne's negative). In neural deafness: Both air and bone conductions are decreased, but still air conduction is better than bone conduction (reduced Rinne's positive).</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Weber's test:</bold> A vibrating tuning fork is kept over the vertex or forehead of the subject. Normally he can hear the vibrations in both ears equally. In conduction deafness: It is better heard in the affected ear or Weber's is lateralized to the affected ear. In neural deafness: It is heard better in the normal ear or Weber's lateralized to the normal ear.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Absolute Bone Conduction (ABC) test:</bold> A vibrating tuning fork is kept over the mastoid process of the patient and instructs him to signal when he stops hearing. Immediately transfer the tuning fork on to the Physician's mastoid process and check whether he can receive any sound. Here it is assumed that the hearing power of the physician is normal.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch10lev2sec59"><h2 class="title">Investigations</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Assessment of hearing loss includes detailed history, developmental assessment and tests of hearing. If the child does not respond to sounds of a voice, he is completely deaf or mentally retarded.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Test of hearing includes—using a tuning fork and an ordinary wrist-watch may also be used for the detection of defective hearing. Audiometer test used after 3 years of age. Labyrinthine test for vestibular functions are carried out satisfactorily by means of caloric tests which are simple, inexpensive and accurate.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Verbal recognition and speech test, electropsychological test and electronystagmogram (ENG) is especially helpful in the evaluation of nystagmus.<a name="page466"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">466</span></span></p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch10lev2sec60"><h2 class="title">Treatments of Conductive Hearing Loss</h2>
<p class="noindent">Types of <bold>conductive hearing loss</bold> include congenital absence of ear canal or failure of the ear canal to be open at birth, congenital absence, malformation, or dysfunction of the middle ear structures, all of which may possibly be surgically corrected. If these are not amenable to successful surgical correction, then the hearing alternatively may be improved with amplification with a bone conduction hearing aid, or a surgically implanted, osseointegrated device (for example, the Baha or Ponto System), or a conventional hearing aid, depending on the status of the hearing nerve.</p>
<p class="indent">Other causes of <bold>conductive hearing loss</bold> are: Infection; tumors; middle ear fluid from infection or Eustachian tube dysfunction; foreign body; and trauma (as in a skull fracture). Acute infections are usually treated with antibiotic or antifungal medications. Chronic ear infections, chronic middle fluid, and tumors usually require surgery. If there is no response to initial medical therapy, infectious middle ear fluid is usually treated with antibiotics while chronic noninfectious middle ear fluid is treated with surgery (or pressure equalizing tubes).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch10lev2sec61"><h2 class="title">Treatment of Sensorineural Hearing Loss</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Sensorineural hearing loss can result from acoustic trauma (or exposure to excessively loud noise), which may respond to medical therapy with corticosteroids to reduce cochlea hair cell swelling and inflammation to improve healing of these injured inner ear structures.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Sensorineural hearing loss can occur from head trauma or abrupt changes in air pressure such as in airplane descent, which can cause inner ear fluid compartment rupture or leakage, which can be toxic to the inner ear. There has been variable success with emergency surgery when this happens.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Sudden sensorineural hearing loss, presumed to be of viral origin, is an otologic emergency that is medically treated with corticosteroids.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Bilateral progressive hearing loss over several months, also diagnosed as autoimmune inner ear disease, is managed medically with long-term corticosteroids and sometimes with drug therapy. Autoimmune inner ear disease is when the body's immune system misdirects its defenses against the inner ear structures to cause damage in this part of the body.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Fluctuating sensorineural hearing loss may be from unknown cause or associated with Meniere's disease. Symptoms of Meniere's disease are hearing loss, tinnitus (or ringing in the ears), and vertigo. Meniere's disease may be treated medically with a low-sodium diet, diuretics, and corticosteroids. If the vertigo is not medically controlled, then various surgical procedures are used to eliminate the vertigo.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Sensorineural hearing loss from tumors of the balance nerve adjacent to the hearing nerve, generally are not reversed with surgical removal or irradiation of these benign tumors. If the hearing loss is mild and the tumors are very small, hearing may be saved in 50% of that undergoing hearing preservation surgery for tumor removal.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Sensorineural hearing loss from disease in the central nervous system may respond to medical management for the specific disease affecting the nervous system. For example, hearing loss secondary to multiple sclerosis may be reversed with treatment for multiple sclerosis.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Irreversible sensorineural hearing loss, the most common form of hearing loss, may be managed with hearing aids. When hearing aids are not enough, this type of hearing loss can be surgically treated with cochlear implants.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent"><bold>Treatments for mixed hearing loss:</bold> Audiologist Mark Ross, PhD, recommends taking care of the conductive component first. There have been times when the addition of the conductive component made the person a better hearing aid candidate, by flattening out the audiogram, for example, while the underlying sensorineural component presented a high-frequency loss. However, still the emphasis would be on treating medically what can be treated.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch10lev2sec62"><h2 class="title">Management</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">The successful management of impaired hearing children lies in early diagnosis. It is important determine the type of hearing defect.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Conduction hearing loss can be treated both medically and surgically. The medical management includes: Acute infections with antibiotics, respiratory allergy and surgical management includes myringotomy and adenotonsillectomy.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Sensorineural defects treated in team approach: It includes physicians, audiologists and speech therapists. Prompt management of bacterial meningitis, judicious use of ototoxic drugs, are very important.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Impaired hearing: The diagnosis and therapy must be started before the age of 3 years. The mother (trained by specialist) must be able to give auditory training to her child in infancy. Later on the use of hearing aids may be resorted to for Sensorineural deafness.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Speech therapy has a useful role to play in the training of partially deaf children and this form of service should be utilized.</p></li>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p class=""><bold>Ineffective airway clearance R/T upper airway obstruction</bold> by tongue and soft tissues, inability to clear respiratory secretions as evidenced by unclear lung sounds, unequal lung expansion, noisy respiration, presence of stridor, cyanosis, or pallor.</p>
<p class="indent"><bold>Client Expected Outcome:</bold> The client maintains patent airway as evidenced by clear lung sounds, equal lung expansion and absence of stridor, cyanosis and pallor. <bold>Nursing Interventions</bold></p>
<p class=""><ul style="list-style-type: square">
<li><p class="">Assess respiratory rate pattern, lung sounds, lung expansion, signs of tissue hypoxia, cyanosis, pallor; presence of airway secretions; occlusion of oropharynx by epiglottis or tongue; aspiration of vomitus or oral secretions.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="italic">Rationale</span>: Provides data for planning care.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Elevate had of bed to 30° angle or place client in lateral or semiprone position.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="italic">Rationale</span>: Head elevation prevents aspiration. Lateral position permits the jaw and tongue to fail forward, thus promoting drainage of secretions.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Insert oral airway (if tongue is paralyzed or is obstructing the airway).</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="italic">Rationale</span>: Prevents obstruction of airway; obstructed airway leads to cerebral hypoxia which increases ICP.<a name="page469"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">469</span></span></p></li>
<li><p class="">Suction airway intermittently.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="italic">Rationale</span>: In the absence of cough and swallowing reflexes, secretions rapidly accumulate in the posterior pharynx and upper trachea and can lead to aspiration. Intermittent suctioning prevents this.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Administer humidified oxygen to the airway before and after suctioning.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="italic">Rationale</span>: Prevents hypoxia which may be caused by sucking out of air while suctioning.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Initiate chest physiotherapy and postural drainage (unless contraindicated).</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="italic">Rationale</span>: Promotes pulmonary hygiene.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Prepare for endotracheal intubation or tracheostomy.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="italic">Rationale</span>: Allows efficient removal of tracheobronchial secretions and protects the airway from aspiration.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Connect the client to mechanical ventilator as needed.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="italic">Rationale</span>: Helps maintaining oxygenation when spontaneous respiration is not possible.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Increase amount of fluids administered at least 2.5 liter per day.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="italic">Rationale</span>: Loosens airway secretions promoting easy removal.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Auscultate chest at least every 8 hours.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="italic">Rationale</span>: Helps detect adventitious breath sounds or absent breath sounds.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Monitor ABG measurements.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="italic">Rationale</span>: Help detect complications of respiratory problems at the earliest.</p></li>

</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Ineffective cerebral tissue perfusion related to effects of increased ICP as evidenced by papilloedema, Cushing's traid, vomiting.</bold></p>
<p class="indent"><bold>Client Expected Outcome:</bold> The client maintains optimum cerebral perfusion as evidenced by absence of signs of increased ICP (papilloedema, projectile vomiting, Cushing's triad, pupillary changes).</p>
<p class="indent"><bold>Plan of Action</bold></p>
<p class=""><ul style="list-style-type: square">
<li><p class="">Assess signs of increased ICP, cerebral edema.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="italic">Rationale:</span> Provides baseline data.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Maintain head of the bed elevated to 30° angle.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="italic">Rationale:</span> Promotes venous return through jugular veins thus preventing cerebral edema.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Maintain head and neck aligned.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="italic">Rationale:</span> Hyperextension, rotation, or hyperflexion of neck causes decreased venous return which will lead to cerebral edema formation.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Administer low flow oxygen and maintain oxygen therapy.</p>
<p class="indent">Suction airway when needed.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="italic">Rationale:</span> These measures prevent hypoxia.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Monitor ABG values</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="italic">Rationale:</span> Rapidly increasing blood flow to the brain causing cerebral edema.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Maintain PaCO<sub>2</sub> (normally 35–45 mm Hg) through hyperventilation.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="italic">Rationale:</span> Decreased PaCO<sub>2</sub> presents vasodilation and thus reduces cerebral blood volume.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Administer osmotic diuretics e.g., mannitol or corticosteroids: Dexamethasone, as prescribed.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="italic">Rationale:</span> Osmotic diuretics promote venous return, corticosteroid manage inflammatory response. Both these are used to prevent cerebral edema.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Administer stool softness as prescribed.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="italic">Rationale:</span> Soft bowel involvements prevent straining or valsalva maneuver because it will increase intra-abdominal pressure and thereby increasing ICP.</p>

<p class="noindent">Apply the nursing process and use a critical thinking approach in your care of patients. The nursing process provides a clinical decision-making approach for you to develop and implement an individualized plan of care for your patients.<a name="page473"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">473</span></span></p>
<div class="section" id="ch10lev2sec72"><h2 class="title">Assessment</h2>
<p class="noindent">When assessing a patient for sensory impairments, it is important to first establish a therapeutic relationship. Individuals may be hesitant to discuss sensory problems. By establishing a good rapport, patients are more likely to share their sensory concerns and effects on functioning. The health history should include questions regarding current status of sensory function, as well as risk for development of sensory impairment. For example, medications that can be ototoxic should be considered a risk factor for hearing impairment. Additionally, opioids and sedatives depress the central nervous system and can impair stimuli perception and reaction. Techniques to identify deficits in vision, hearing, smell, taste, and sensation are used during the physical exam.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">There are several factors to consider when assessing a patient's sensory functioning, such as age, their perception of the impairment, and the impact of the sensory impairment on their daily functioning.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Age is an important consideration because many sensory functions can be affected by the aging process. However, it should not be assumed that all sensory problems are a normal part of the aging process.</p></li>
<li><p class="">It is important to assess the patient's perception of sensory impairment and its impact on their functioning, as well for any changes in recent behavior, mental status, emotional status, or cognitive function changes.</p></li>
<li><p class="">For example, individuals experiencing hearing loss may be more irritable or anxious and avoid social gatherings due to their hearing impairment. If a patient is experiencing confusion, it is important to evaluate underlying factors that can cause confusion.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The environment is also an important consideration when assessing an individual's sensory functioning.</p></li>
<li><p class="">It is important to understand the patient's daily activities and their ability to perform them; their work and living environment; their use of protective equipment, such as ear protection when working with loud equipment; and their adherence with routine screenings, such as vision and hearing exams. Individuals with sensory impairments are at increased risk for falls and injury, so it is important to encourage basic safety features in the environment, including adequate lighting, availability of handrails and grab bars, hazard-free walkways, and appropriate settings on water heater controls.</p></li>
<li><p class="">When sensory impairments are identified, they should be documented in the patient's chart and communicated to collaborative team members working with the individual.</p></li>
<li><p class="">For example, when an individual has a hearing impairment, it is important to consider their alternative communication needs. They may use lipreading and require face-to-face views when communicating.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The use of assistive devices for sensory functioning, such as glasses and hearing aids, should also be documented and communicated.</p></li>
<li><p class="">It is important to ensure proper functioning of the devices for optimal patient outcomes. In fact, a hospitalized older adult is at greater risk for developing delirium when their typical glasses and hearing aids (i.e., their “eyes and ears”) are not available, causing sensory deprivation.</p></li>

<div class="section" id="ch10lev2sec79"><h2 class="title">Diagnoses</h2>
<p class="noindent">Commonly used NANDA-I nursing diagnoses for patients experiencing alterations in sensory function include the following:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Risk for injury</p></li>
<li><p class="">Risk for fall</p></li>
<li><p class="">Impaired verbal communication</p></li>
<li><p class="">Social isolation</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">A common NANDA diagnosis related to sensory alterations is Risk for Injury, which is defined as, “Susceptible to physical damage due to environmental conditions interacting with the individual's adaptive and defensive resources, which may compromise health.” “Alteration in sensation” is an associated condition for this nursing diagnosis. For risk diagnoses, there are no related factors (etiological factors) because you are identifying vulnerability in a patient for a potential problem that is not yet present. Additionally, the nurse cannot resolve sensory alteration, so it should not be listed as a related factor to which interventions are directed. Instead, the phrase “as evidenced by” is used to refer to the evidence of risk that exists.</p>
<p class="indent">Therefore, a sample NANDA-I diagnosis in current would be as follows: “Risk for Injury as evidenced by alteration in vision.”</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch10lev2sec80"><h2 class="title">Outcomes</h2>
<p class="noindent">An overall goal for a patient at risk for injury related to alteration in sensation is as follows:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">The patient will remain free from injury.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">An example of a “SMART” expected outcome for a patient with impaired vision:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">The patient will be able to verbalize the layout of the room within four hours of admission.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch10lev2sec81"><h2 class="title">Planning Interventions</h2>
<p class="noindent">There are many nursing interventions used for individuals with impaired sensory function. To assist patients to communicate effectively and to promote their quality of life, it is important for the nurse to customize appropriate interventions based on their individual needs. As always, refer to an evidence-based nursing care planning resource when customizing interventions for specific patients.</p>

<p class="noindent">Nurses provide care to all clients of all ages for all disorders including physical disorders and psychological disorders. All of this nursing care must be provided in a supportive, nonthreatening, unbiased, caring, compassionate, and nonjudgmental manner. The client is the focus of care and all nurse-client relationships so nurses must support the clients and address their needs without the nurse injecting their own bias and judgments.<a name="page476"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">476</span></span></p>
