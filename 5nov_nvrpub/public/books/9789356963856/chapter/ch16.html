<li><p class=""><bold>Philosophy:</bold> Beliefs and values that define a way of thinking and are generally known and understood by a group or discipline.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Theory:</bold> A belief, policy, or procedure proposed or followed as the basis of action. It refers to a logical group of general propositions used as principles of explanation. Theories are also used to describe, predict, or control phenomena.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Concept:</bold> Concepts are often called the building blocks of theories. They are primarily the vehicles of thought that involve images.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Models:</bold> Models are representations of the interaction among and between the concepts showing patterns. They present an overview of the thinking behind the theory and may demonstrate how theory can be introduced into practice.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Conceptual framework:</bold> A conceptual framework is a group of related ideas, statements, or concepts. It is often used interchangeably with the conceptual model and with grand theories.</p></li>

</div><div class="section" id="ch16lev1sec2"><h1 class="title">INTRODUCTION</h1>
<p class="noindent">Nursing theories are organized bodies of knowledge to define what nursing is, what nurses do, and why do they do it. Nursing theories provide a way to define nursing as a unique discipline that is separate from other disciplines (e.g., medicine). It is a framework of concepts and purposes intended to guide the practice of nursing at a more concrete and specific level. Nursing theories are the basis of nursing practice today. In many cases, nursing theory guides knowledge development and directs education, research, and practice. Historically, nursing was not recognized as an academic discipline or as a profession we view it today. Before nursing theories were developed, nursing was considered to be a task-oriented occupation. The training and function of nurses were under the direction and control of the medical profession.</p>
</div><div class="section" id="ch16lev1sec3"><h1 class="title">HISTORY OF NURSING THEORIES</h1>
<p class="noindent">The first nursing theories appeared in the late 1800s when a strong emphasis was placed on nursing education. <bold><a href="#ch16tbl1" class="ulink-inter">Table 16.1</a></bold> summarizes nursing metaparadigm of different nurse.</p>

<li><p class="">In 1860, Florence Nightingale defined nursing in her “Environmental Theory” as “the act of utilizing the environment of the patient to assist him in his recovery.”</p></li>
<li><p class="">In the 1950s, there is a consensus among nursing scholars that nursing needed to validate itself through the production of its own scientifically tested body of knowledge.<a name="page613"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">613</span></span></p>

<p class="noindent">There are four major concepts that are frequently interrelated and fundamental to nursing theory: person, environment, health, and nursing. These four are collectively referred to as metaparadigm for nursing <bold>(<a href="#ch16fig1" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 16.1</a>)</bold>.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p class=""><bold>Person:</bold> Person (also referred to as client or human beings) is the recipient of nursing care and may include individuals, patients, groups, families, and communities.<a name="page615"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">615</span></span></p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Environment:</bold> Environment (or situation) is defined as the internal and external surrounds that affect the client. It includes all positive or negative conditions that affect the patient, the physical environment, such as families, friends, and significant others, and the setting for where they go for their healthcare.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Health:</bold> Health is defined as the degree of wellness or well-being that the client experiences. It may have different meanings for each patient, the clinical setting, and the healthcare provider.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Nursing:</bold> The attributes, characteristics, and actions of the nurse providing care on behalf of or in conjunction with, the client. There are numerous definitions of nursing, though nursing scholars may have difficulty agreeing on its exact definition, the ultimate goal of nursing theories is to improve patient care.</p></li>

<p class="noindent">For a theory to be a theory it has to contain a set of concepts, definitions, relational statements, and assumptions that explain a phenomenon. It should also explain how these components relate to each other.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch16lev2sec1"><h2 class="title">Phenomenon</h2>
<p class="noindent">A term given to describe an idea or responses about an event, a situation, a process, a group of events, or a group of situations. Phenomena may be temporary or permanent. Nursing theories focus on the phenomena of nursing.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch16lev2sec2"><h2 class="title">Concepts</h2>
<p class="noindent">Interrelated concepts define a theory. Concepts are used to help describe or label a phenomenon. They are words or phrases that identify, define, and establish structure and boundaries for ideas generated about a particular phenomenon. Concepts may be abstract or concrete.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Abstract concepts:</bold> Defined as mentally constructed independent of a specific time or place.</p></li>

</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch16lev2sec3"><h2 class="title">Definitions</h2>
<p class="noindent">Definitions are used to convey the general meaning of the concepts of the theory. Definitions can be theoretical or operational.</p>

<li><p class=""><bold>Operational definitions:</bold> States how concepts are measured.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Relational statements:</bold> Relational statements define the relationships between two or more concepts. They are the chains that link concepts to one another.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Assumptions:</bold> Assumptions are accepted as truths and are based on values and beliefs. These are statements that explain the nature of concepts, definitions, purpose, relationships, and structure of a theory.</p></li>

<p class="noindent">The professional nurse must have a sound base of theoretical. Knowledge about interactions since the base of health teaching relates to the nurse's ability to interact with Mrs Dolphin and Mr Dolphin ability to interact with others.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch16lev2sec9"><h2 class="title">Adoptive Theories</h2>
<p class="noindent">Mrs Dolphin needs to be assessed in terms of her ability to adapt to both her pregnancy and the birth of a child. The nurse needs to be able to explain and hypothesize physical and emotional changes in Mrs Dolphin.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch16lev2sec10"><h2 class="title">Other Theories</h2>
<p class="noindent">Other theories can also be identified that will offer the nurse insight into both assessing and planning care. For example, role theories will assist in explaining both the role of the nurse and Mrs Dolphin's role as a mother. Change theory will offer insight into the expected behaviors that evolve when significant change occurs within an environment. Nursing theories that explain phenomena and guide the nurse in giving care would be instrumental as guidelines to care. <bold><a href="#ch16fig7" class="ulink-inter">Figure 16.7</a></bold> shows nursing metaparadigm approach.<a name="page618"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">618</span></span></p>

</div><div class="section" id="ch16lev1sec15"><h1 class="title">PEPLAU’S THEORY (1952)</h1>
<p class="noindent">Hildegard E Peplau was born on September 1, 1909, and graduated from Pottstown, Pennsylvania hospital, School of Nursing in 1931. The nature of science and nursing refers to the body of verified knowledge found within the discipline of nursing, i.e., mainly knowledge from the biological and behavioral sciences <bold>(<a href="#ch16fig9" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 16.9</a>)</bold>. <bold><a href="#ch16tbl2" class="ulink-inter">Table 16.2</a></bold> summarizes interpersonal theory and nursing process.</p>
<p class="indent">The synthesis, reorganization, or extension of concepts drawn from the basic and applied sciences, which is their reformation tend to become new concepts have led to the growth of nursing science. Then the evolution of Peplau's theory of interpersonal relations resulted. Peplau's theory focuses on the individual nurse and the interaction process; the result is the nurse-client relationship. The major concepts defined/viewed are as follows:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Psychodynamic nursing:</bold> Psychodynamic nursing is being able to understand one's own behavior to help others identify felt difficulties, and to apply principles of human relations to the problems that arise at all levels of experience. She describes the structural concepts of interpersonal process and both the nurse–patient relationship to be based on psychodynamic nursing.</p>
<p class=""><div class="figure" id="ch16fig9" data-label="Fig. 16.9"><div class="title"><span class="item-label">Fig. 16.9</span> Peplau's theory of interpersonal relationships.</div><img alt="Fig. 16.9" src="/MediumImage/619-1.jpg"><div class="additional-markup"></div></div><a name="page620"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">620</span></span></p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Nurse–patient relationship (<a href="#ch16fig10" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 16.10</a>):</bold> Nurse–patient relationship described by the Peplau in four phases, i.e., orientation, identification, exploitation, and resolution:
<ul style="list-style-type: square">
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">In orientation phase,</span> the individual has a felt need and seeks professional assistance. The nurse helps the patient recognize and understand his problem and determine his need for help.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">In identification phase,</span> the patient identifies with those who can help him (relatedness). The nurse permits exploration feelings to aid the patient in undergoing illness as an experience that reorients feelings and strengthens positive forces in the personality and provides needed satisfaction.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">In exploitation phase,</span> the patient attempts to derive full value from what is offered him through the relationship. Now goals to be achieved through personal efforts can be projected and power shifted from the nurse to the patient as the patient delays gratification to achieve the newly formed goals.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">In the phase of resolution,</span> old goals are gradually put aside and new goals are adopted. This is a process in which the patient frees himself from identification with the nurse.</p></li></ul></p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Nursing roles:</bold> Peplau describes six different nursing roles that emerge in the various phases of the nurse–patient relationship as:
<ul style="list-style-type: square">
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Role of the stranger</span>: In this role both nurse and patient are stranger to each other, the patient should be treated as individual and with ordinary courtesy. This coincides with the identification phase.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Role of resource person</span>: In this role nurse provides specific answers to questions, especially health information, and interprets to the patient the treatment or medical plan of care. Here the nurse also determines what type of response is appropriate for constructive learning, either straight forward factual answers or providing counseling.</p></li></ul></p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Teaching role:</bold> It is a combination of all roles. Peplau separates teaching into two categories, i.e., instructional which consists largely of giving information and is the form explained in educational literature and practical which is using the experience of the learner as a basis from which learning products are developed.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Leadership role:</bold> It involves the democratic process. The nurse helps the patient meet the tasks at hand through a relationship of cooperation and active participation.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Surrogate role:</bold> The patient casts the nurse in the surrogate role. The nurse's attitudes and behaviors create ‘feeling tones’ in the patient that reactivate feelings generate in a prior relationship. The nurse's function is to assist the patient in recognizing similarities between herself and the person recalled by the patient. She then helps the patient see the differences in her role and that of the recalled person. In this phase, nurse and patient defines areas of dependence, independence and finally interdependence.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Counseling role:</bold> Peplau believes the counseling role has the greatest emphasis on psychiatric nursing. Counseling functions in the nurse–patient relationship by the way nurses response to patient demands.</p></li>

<div class="section" id="ch16lev2sec16"><h2 class="title">Nursing</h2>
<p class="noindent">Nursing is described by Peplau as a significant, therapeutic, interpersonal process. It functions comparatively with other human processes that make health possible for individuals in communities. When professional health teams offer health services, nurses participate in the organization of conditions that facilitate natural ongoing tendencies in human organism.<a name="page621"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">621</span></span></p>
<p class="indent">‘Nursing is an educative instrument, a maturing force that aims to promote forward movement of personality in the direction of creative constructive, productive, personal, and community living’.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch16lev2sec17"><h2 class="title">Person</h2>
<p class="noindent">Person refers to man. Man is an organism that lives in an unstable equilibrium.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch16lev2sec18"><h2 class="title">Health</h2>
<p class="noindent">Health is defined by Peplau as ‘a word symbol that implies forward movement of personality and other ongoing human processes in the direction of creative, constructive, productive, personal and community living’.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch16lev2sec19"><h2 class="title">Environment</h2>
<p class="noindent">Environment is defined in terms of ‘existing forces outside the organism and in the context of cultures’, from which morals, customs, and beliefs are acquired. However, general conditions that are likely to lead to health always include the interpersonal process.</p>
<p class="indent">According to this theory the client is an individual with a felt need, and nursing is an interpersonal and therapeutic process. Nursing goal is to educate the client and family and to help the client reach mature personality development. Therefore nurse strives to develop a nurse–patient relationship in which the nurse serves as a research person, counselor and surrogate. This theory creates a ‘making force’ through which interpersonal effectiveness assists in meeting the client needs.</p>

<p class="noindent">Virginia Henderson was born in 1897, a native of Kansas City, Missouri, spent her developmental years in Virginia because her father practiced law in Washington, DC. During World War I, she developed an interest in nursing. The major concepts defined by Henderson are as follows <bold>(<a href="#ch16fig11" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 16.11</a>).</bold></p>
<div class="section" id="ch16lev2sec20"><h2 class="title">Nursing</h2>
<p class="noindent">Henderson defines nursing in functional terms, i.e., ‘the unique function of the nurse is to assist the individual, sick or well, in the performance of those activities contributing to health or its recovery (or to peaceful death) that she would perform unaided if she had the necessary strength, will or knowledge. And to do this is such a way as to help her gain independence as rapidly as possible’.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch16lev2sec21"><h2 class="title">Health</h2>
<p class="noindent">Henderson did not define health, but looking into several definitions of health. She views health in terms of patient's ability to perform unaided the 14 components of nursing care. She says it is ‘the quality or health rather than life itself, that margin of mental physical vigor that allows a person to work most effectively and to reach his highest potential level of satisfaction of life’ <bold>(<a href="#ch16fig12" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 16.12</a>)</bold>.</p>

<div class="section" id="ch16lev2sec27"><h2 class="title">Nursing Agency</h2>
<p class="noindent">Nursing agency refers to the complex property or attribute of persons educated and trained as nurses that is enabling when exercised for knowing and helping others, know their therapeutic self-care demands, for helping others meet or in meeting their therapeutic self-care demands, and in helping other regulate the exercise or development of their self-care agency or their dependent care agency. Therapeutic demand is a humanly constructed entity, with an objective basis in information that describes in individual structurally, functionally, and developmentally.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch16lev2sec28"><h2 class="title">Nursing System</h2>
<p class="noindent">Nursing system refers to a continuing series of actions produced when nurses link one way or a number of ways in helping to their own actions or the actions of the persons under care that are directed to meet these persons’ therapeutic self-care demands or to regulate their self-care agency. Self-care agency is the complex acquired ability to meet one's continuing requirement for care them regulated life processes, maintains or promotes integrity of human structures and functioning, and human development and promotes wellbeing.</p>
<p class="indent">Three types of nursing system (described by Orem) are as follows <bold>(<a href="#ch16fig13" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 16.13</a>)</bold>:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p class=""><bold>Wholly compensatory nursing systems:</bold> These are needed when the nurse should be compensating for a patients total inability for (or prescription against) engaging and self-care activities that require ambulation and manipulation of movements.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Partially compensatory nursing system:</bold> It exists when both nurse and patient perform care measures or other actions involving manipulative tasks or ambulation.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Supportive educative nursing system:</bold> These are for situations when the patient is able to perform or can and should learn to perform required measures for externally or internally oriented self-care but cannot do so without assistance. The methods of assistance will include acting or doing for guidance, i.e., teaching, supporting, and providing a developmental environment.</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="indent">In Orem's self-care deficit theory, nursing care becomes necessary when client is unable to fulfill biological, psychological, developmental and/or social needs. The goal of nursing is to care for and help client within total self-care. She viewed person/patient in an individual unable to continuously maintain self-care in sustaining life and health, in recovering from disease or injury or in coping with their effects.</p>

<p class="indent">According to Orem, health is an ability to meet self-care demands that contribute to the maintenance and promotion of structural integrity, functioning, and development. Illness occurs when a individual is incapable of maintaining self-care as a result of health related limitations. She perceived environment that any setting in which a patient has unmet self-care needs. And nursing is service of deliberately selected and performed actions to assist individuals to maintain self-care, including structural integrity, functioning, and development. Accordingly nursing care is necessary when the client is unable to fulfill biological, psychological, developmental and/or social needs. The nurse determines why a client is unable to meet these needs, what must be done to enable the client to meet them and how much self-care the client is able to perform.</p>
<p class="noindent"><bold>Orem describes her philosophy of nursing as follows:</bold> Action and the provision and management of it on continuous basis in order to sustain life and health, recover from disease or injury, and cope with their effects. Self-care is a requirement of every person—man, women, and child. When self-care is not maintained, illness, disease or death will occur. Nurses sometimes manage and maintain required self-care continuously for persons who are totally incapable. In other instance, nurses help persons to maintain required self-care by performing some but not all care measures, by supervising others who assist patients and by instructing and guiding individuals as they gradually move toward self-care.</p>
<p class="indent">Orem suggests that a person needs nursing when the person has a health-related self-care deficit. The areas of nursing practice are:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Entering into and maintaining nurse-client relationships with individuals families or groups.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Determining if and how clients can be helped through nursing.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Responding to clients’ requirements and needs.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Giving direct help to clients and families.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Coordinating and integrating nursing with the clients’ daily living, other healthcare activities, and social or educational services required.</p></li>

<p class="noindent">Betty Neuman was born on 1924, completed her initial nursing education at Akron, Ohio in 1947, then earned master degree in mental health in 1966 and received doctorate degree in clinical psychology in 1985. She was a pioneer of nursing involvement in mental health.</p>
<p class="indent">The major concepts identified in her model are: holistic client approach, open system, basic structure, environment, created environment, stresses, lines of defense and resistance, degree of reaction, prevention as intervention, and reconstruction. Further included the concepts of scholastic approach, content, process input and output, negentropy, entropy, stability, wellness and illness.</p>
<div class="figure" id="ch16fig14" data-label="Fig. 16.14"><div class="title"><span class="item-label">Fig. 16.14</span> Betty Neuman systems model.</div><img alt="Fig. 16.14" src="/MediumImage/624-1.jpg"><div class="additional-markup"></div></div>
<p class="indent">To Neuman, the persons are dynamic composite of physiological, sociocultural, and developmental variables that function as an open system <bold>(<a href="#ch16fig14" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 16.14</a>)</bold>. As an open system, the person interacts with adjusts to and it adjusted by the environment, which is viewed as stressor. Stressors disrupt the system. She includes intrapersonal, interpersonal and extra personal stressor.</p>
<p class="indent">Neuman believes that nursing is concerned with the whole person. She views nursing as a ‘unique profession in that it is concerned with all of the variables affecting an individual response to stress’. Because the nurses perception influences the care program. Neuman equates health to wellness and defines health and/or wellness as ‘the condition in which all parts and subparts (variables) are in harmony with the whole of the client’. So health is a dynamic equilibrium on the normal line of defense. Illness occurs due to reaction to stressor with lines of resistance, internal and external stressors and restrictive factors are the environment. The reduction of the stressors through prevention acts at three levels of nursing.</p>
<p class="indent">The goal of nursing is to assist individual, families, and groups in attaining and maintaining maximal level of total wellness. The nurse assesses managers and evaluates client systems. Nursing focuses on the variables affecting the client response to the stressor. Nursing action are earned out on three levels. When the stressor is identified but no reaction has occurred; interventions can decrease the degree of reaction or increase the line of defense. This is called primary prevention. When the reaction has already happened, secondary prevention is carried out, with intervention aimed at treating symptoms and reducing reactions. After active treatment, tertiary prevention strengthens the lines of defense through education and uses the systems total resources to prevent further occurrence. <bold><a href="#ch16fig15" class="ulink-inter">Figure 16.15</a></bold> shows Neuman's systems model format.<a name="page625"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">625</span></span></p>

<p class="indent">Neuman model is applicable to all phases of the nursing process. It can be applied across all clinical areas and is especially useful for individuals and families. It is a holistic approach because each system or subsystem cannot be isolated; rather, the influence of each system on the whole must be considered. The three levels of prevention are useful guidelines for planning nursing interventions.</p>

<p class="noindent">Martha E Rogers was born on May 12, 1914 in Dallas, Texas. She began her collegiate education at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville and acquired Doctorate degree (EdD) from John Hopkins University, Balmer. Roger felt that historically the term ‘nursing’ most often has been used as a verb simplifying ‘to do’ when nursing is perceived as a science. The term ‘nursing’ being a noun, signifies body of knowledge. She describes nursing as a learned profession that is both a science and an art. <bold><a href="#ch16fig16" class="ulink-inter">Figure 16.16</a></bold> shows Rogers self-theory.</p>
<div class="figure" id="ch16fig16" data-label="Fig. 16.16"><div class="title"><span class="item-label">Fig. 16.16</span> Rogers: Self-theory.</div><img alt="Fig. 16.16" src="/MediumImage/625-2.jpg"><div class="additional-markup"></div></div>
<p class="indent">Nursing is a humanistic science dedicated to compassionate concern for maintaining and promoting health, preventing illness and caring for and rehabilitating the sick and disabled. Nursing seeks to promote symphonic interactions between the environment and man, to strengthen the coherence and integrity of the human beings and do direct and redirect patterns of interaction between man and his environment for the realization of maximum health potential.</p>
<p class="indent">Roger considers man (unitary fluman being) as an energy field co-existence within the universe. An energy field constitutes the fundamental unit of both the living and nonliving. Field is unifying concept and energy signifies the dynamic nature of the field. Energy fields are infinite, so she identified only two, i.e., the human field and the environment field:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p class="">The unitary human being (human field) is defined as an irreducible, indivisible, pandimensional energy field identified by pattern and manifested characteristics that are specific to the whole and which cannot be predicted from knowledge of the parts.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The environment field is defined as an irreducible pandimensional energy field identified by pattern and integral with human field. Each environmental field is specific to its given human field. Both change continuously and creatively. Unitary man evolves along life process. Client continuously changes and coexists with environment.</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="indent">Roger viewed the terms health and illness as value leader, arbitrarily defined but as part of the same continuum, i.e., health occurs when patterns of living are in harmony with environmental change and illness occurs when patterns of living conflicts with environmental change and are deemed unacceptable.</p>

Her views on nursing primarily as a science and is committed to nursing research. Nursing, therefore, corporate knowledge of the basic sciences and physiology, as well as nursing knowledge. The science of nursing aims to provide a body of abstract knowledge growing out, of scientific research and logical analysis and capable of being translated into nursing practice. Nursing body of knowledge is a new product specific to nursing.</p>

</div><div class="section" id="ch16lev1sec20"><h1 class="title">ROY’S THEORY (1979)</h1>
<p class="noindent">Sister Callista Roy, a member of the Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondelet, was born on October 14, 1939 in Los Angeles, California. She was the receiver of BA in Nursing, MSc Nursing, and MA in Sociology and PhD in Sociology.</p>
<p class="noindent"><bold>The major concepts defined by Roy are as follows:</bold></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Person:</bold> According to Roy, a person is a biopsychosocial being in constant interaction with a changing environment. She defined the person, the recipient of nursing care, as a living complex, adaptive system with internal processes (the cognator and regulator) acting to maintain adaptation in the four adaptive modes, i.e., physiological needs, self-concept, role functions, and interdependence. The person as a living system is ‘a whole’ made up of parts or subsystems that function as a unity for some purpose, patient is a person or family with unusual stressor or ineffective coping mechanism (<bold><a href="#ch16fig17" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 16.17</a>)</bold>.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Health:</bold> It is a state and a process of being and becoming an integrated and whole person. Lack of integration represents lack of health.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Environment:</bold> According to Roy environment is all the conditions, circumstances, and influences surrounding and affecting the development and behavior of persons or groups. Factors in the environment that affect the person are categorized as focal, contextual, and residual stimuli.</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="ch16lev2sec29"><h2 class="title">Nursing</h2>
<p class="noindent">It is defined broadly as ‘a theoretical system of knowledge which prescribes a process of analysis and action related to the care of the ill or potentially ill person’.</p>
<p class="indent">Roy differentiates nursing as a science from nursing as a practice discipline. Nursing science is a developing system of knowledge about person that observes, classifies, and relates the processes by which persons positively affect their health status. Nursing as practice discipline is nursing scientific body of knowledge used for the purpose of providing an essential service to sick.</p>
</div>
</div><div class="section" id="ch16lev1sec21"><h1 class="title">LINKING THEORIES WITH NURSING PROCESS</h1>
<p class="noindent">Theories are general explanations which scholars use to explain, control and understand commonly occurring events. Theories are best understood as preliminary explanations that reflect the current understanding of events. “Theory is defined as a set of propositions used to describe, explain, predict and control events”. Here set refers to a group of circumstances, situations, and so on, joined and treated as a whole; propositions refers to statements about how two or more concepts are related; concepts refers to an abstract classification of data, temperature; describe means of tell about in details; explain means to offer reasons for; predict means to foretell/forecast; control means to exercise as regulating influence over; and phenomena refer to theory includes the joint functions of theory, i.e., description explanation, prediction and control.</p>
<p class="indent">Nursing intervention may take place at any point on the continuum. Nursing diagnosis may focus on behavior associated with a medical diagnosis or other health behavior that the patient wishes to change. A nurse may practice primary prevention by intervening in a potential health problem, secondary prevention by intervening in an actual acute health problem or tertiary prevention by intervening to limit the disability caused by actual chronic health problems.</p>

<p class="indent">The nursing assessment of the patient includes presenting complaints, past history, family history, personal history, occupational history, sexual history, physical examination and mental status examination. Additional data may be collected from significant other sources and by reviewing the systems. A nursing diagnosis is then formulated and based on this diagnosis; planning and interventions, is carried out. Finally, evaluation will be done to find out the effectiveness of nursing interventions. Providing nursing care is a collaborative effort, with both the nurse and the patient contributing ideas and energy to the therapeutic process.</p>

<p class="noindent">Theory helps in providing knowledge to improve practice by describing, explaining, predicting, and controlling phenomena. Nurses power is increased through theoretical knowledge because systematically developed more likely to be successful. In addition, nurses will know why they are doing, what they are doing if challenged. Theory provides professional autonomy by guiding the nursing practice, education and research functions of profession. And also there has been interest in identifying a body of nursing knowledge that is essential to professional nursing practice. Theory development contributes to knowledge building and is seen a means of establishing ‘nursing as a profession’.</p>
