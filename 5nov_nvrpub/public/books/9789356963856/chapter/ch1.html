<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Assessment:</bold> Diagnostic procedures, history, physical services and tests for the purpose of determining whether or not an eligible. Insured is an appropriate candidate for specified healthcare services.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Appraisal (assessment):</bold> Appraisal or assessment follows on from the scoping stage of a HIA, where the potential health impacts which have been identified are assessed and evaluated using the available evidence base.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Admission assessment:</bold> Comprehensive nursing assessment including patient history, general appearance, physical examination and vital signs completed at the time of admission.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Data retrieval:</bold> The collection of patient care data from medical records.</p></li>

<p class="noindent">Health assessment is an essential nursing function which provides foundation for quality nursing care and intervention. It helps to identify the strengths of the clients in promoting health. Health assessment also helps to identify client's needs, clinical problems or nursing diagnoses and to evaluate responses of the person to health problems and intervention. An accurate and thorough health assessment reflects the knowledge and skills of a professional nurse. Assessment is a key component of nursing practice, required for planning and provision of patient and family centered care. The registered nurse assesses, plans, implements and evaluates nursing care in collaboration with individuals and the multidisciplinary healthcare team so as to achieve goals and health outcomes.</p>
</div><div class="section" id="ch1lev1sec4"><h1 class="title">DEFINITION</h1>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Health assessment is a systematic, deliberative and interactive process by which nurses use critical thinking to collect, validate, analyze and synthesize the collected information in order to make judgment about the health status and life processes of individuals, families and communities.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Objective data in nursing is part of the health assessment that involves the collection of information through observations. In the healthcare environment, the senses of seeing, hearing, smelling and touching are used to gather information about the patient. The patient's behaviors, actions, test results, measurements and the physical examination are also included.</p></li>

<p class="noindent">In planning and performing health assessment, the nurse needs to consider the following:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">An accurate and timely health assessment provides foundation for nursing care and intervention.</p></li>
<li><p class="">A comprehensive assessment incorporates information about a client's physiologic, psychosocial, spiritual health, cultural and environmental factors as well as client's developmental status.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The health assessment process should include data collection, documentation and evaluation of the client's health status and responses to health problems and intervention.</p></li>
<li><p class="">All documentation should be objective, accurate, clear, concise, specific and current.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Health assessment is practiced in all healthcare settings whenever there is nurse-client interaction.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Information gathered from health assessment should be communicated to other healthcare professionals in order to facilitate collaborative management of clients and for continuity of care.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Client's confidentiality should be kept.</p></li>

<p class="noindent">The health assessment interview is initiated to gather specific information regarding the patient and the patient's health status. The patient interview may also serve to validate other health-related data and identify the patient's knowledge of his/her own health and illness status. The patient interview is very important, as it provides the foundation for subsequent nurse–patient interactions and for medical and nursing interventions.</p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="ch1lev2sec14"><h2 class="title">Adaptive Questioning</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Also referred to as guided questioning, adaptive questioning helps you encourage a patient to fully communicate without interrupting the flow of his or her narrative.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Start with general questions, making them more specific as you move through the interview.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Health assessments in nursing require questioning that elicits a graded response versus a yes or no reply.</p></li>
<li><p class="">A series of questions, asked one at a time, often helps patients open up, as does offering multiple choices for answers.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Request additional information when necessary by asking the patient to clarify their statements.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Repeating his/her statements (a technique called echoing) is also helpful, as is using verbal and nonverbal continuers, such as nodding your head or saying things like “go on.”</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch1lev2sec15"><h2 class="title">Nonverbal Communication</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Nursing assessments also require that you be in tune with a patient's nonverbal communication, such as posture, eye contact, facial expression, and the like.</p></li>

<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Empathy is key in nursing health assessments, as it demonstrates that you understand and care about what a patient is experiencing and helps establish a trusting nurse–patient relationship.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Empathic responses during a health history assessment interview can be both verbal (“I understand”) and nonverbal (such as offering a tissue if the patient is crying).</p></li>
<li><p class="">Beyond being empathic, be sure to validate patients’ feelings to help reassure them that their emotions are natural and reasonable and their problems are understood and will be fully addressed.</p></li>

<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Health problems can elicit feelings of anxiety in patients. One way to put their fears at ease is to use transitions during their health history assessment to let them know what they should expect next, such as a change in subject matter or a physical examination.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Patients also feel vulnerable when they are experiencing health problems, making it essential to empower them with the idea that their participation in the process and working closely with their medical team can make a positive difference in their outcomes.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div><div class="section" id="ch1lev1sec10"><h1 class="title">OBSERVATION TECHNIQUES</h1>
<p class="noindent">Health observation and assessment is a systematic process to collect data about a patient. This data provides information about the patient's condition, and is used to inform the care which is appropriate for that patient. Nurses undertake health observation and assessment constantly, in all clinical settings. Health observation and assessment is the first step in the nursing care cycle.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch1lev2sec18"><h2 class="title">Principles</h2>
<p class="noindent">There are several core principles that underlie the practice of nursing observation. The principles hold that:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Nursing observation is multifaceted</p></li>
<li><p class="">Observation and assessment are interrelated</p></li>
<li><p class="">Observation is grounded in therapeutic engagement with the person</p></li>
<li><p class="">Nurses appreciate how inpatient environments influence behavior</p></li>
<li><p class="">Observations are communicated between colleagues</p></li>
<li><p class="">There is a clear process of documentation that is timely and descriptive</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch1lev2sec19"><h2 class="title">Levels of Observation</h2>
<p class="noindent">All services should have explicit policies on observation types and frequencies and communication of observations. Since observation, assessment and interventions are interlinked, nurses sighting people and talking with them is implicit in describing levels of observation. One possible model with four defined levels of observation is outlined below:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Constant (arm's length)—periods of one-to-one nursing observation, with the person within an arm's length of an experienced nurse at all times</p></li>
<li><p class="">Constant (visual)—periods of one-to-one nursing observation, with the person within the vision of an experienced nurse at all times</p></li>
<li><p class="">Intermittent—an experienced nurse (or mentored, less experienced nurse) engages with a person at regular intervals. The identified risk factors and purpose of observation will determine the frequency (for example, several times per hour) and pattern of observations (for example, equal or random lengths of time between observations)</p></li>
<li><p class="">Negotiated—nurses negotiate the frequency of engagement with people who do not have identified risk factors requiring intermittent or constant observation.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch1lev2sec20"><h2 class="title">Observation Techniques during a Health Assessment</h2>
<p class="noindent">During the health assessment nurses need to have an analytical ability to observe and interpret the nonverbal activities of the client. Nonverbal activities are important because they provide a clue to understanding the feelings. Nurses should observe the following things during health assessment:<a name="page8"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">8</span></span></p>
<div class="section" id="ch1lev3sec1"><h3 class="title">Physical Appearance</h3>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Person's physical appearance can provide lots of information about the client. According to Hans Selye, a person's physical condition can be also known through his appearance.</p></li>
<li><p class="">For example, a person who looks sick may have some internal disease. Inattention to dressing and grooming suggests a person has some problem, for that he/she does not have the energy to maintain his grooming.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Choice of clothing also represents the role of the person, such as (student, worker and professionals).</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch1lev3sec2"><h3 class="title">Posture</h3>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">In the beginning, nurses need to observe the posture and position of the client.</p></li>
<li><p class="">An open posture exposing the large muscle group of the client suggest his/her feeling of relaxation. It shows he/she is comfortable with the interviewer.</p></li>
<li><p class="">A closed position, such as crossed legs and closed arms suggests the client is defensive and anxious he/she does not want to share any information with the interviewer.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Changing position during interview indicates the comfort level with new topics.</p></li>
<li><p class="">For example, a client was in an open posture at starting of the interview, when the interviewer asked about the relationship with his wife, he sat in a closed posture. It shows client is comfortable with the ‘relation’ topic.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch1lev3sec3"><h3 class="title">Gesture</h3>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Gesture shows the interest of the interviewer towards the client. Nodding head, open posture, accepting client, showing attention, or agreement is favorable gestures.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Whereas fidgeting of hand and picking nails shows anxiety. So nurses must observe the gestures of the client to recognize the feelings of the client.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch1lev3sec4"><h3 class="title">Facial Expression</h3>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">When we meet any person, the first thing we see is a higher facial expression.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The facial expression also tells many things about that person, character, and personality. Some physical conditions, such as pain, sadness are also reflected through facial expressions.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch1lev3sec5"><h3 class="title">Eye Contact</h3>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">During the interview, eye contact is very important to show how much confident you are.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Lack of eye contact indicates the person is shy, withdrawn, depressed, bored, and confused.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Casual eye contact should be there, eye contact should not be penetrating.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch1lev3sec6"><h3 class="title">Voice</h3>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">The interviewer must aware of the tone of the voice of the client.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Not only do spoken words give meaning, but also voice characteristics, such as intensity, rate of speech, pitch, and any pauses give meaning to the conversation.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Anxious people speak louder and faster than normal.</p></li>
<li><p class="">A soft voice may indicate the person's shyness and fear. Even pauses also give meaning to the discussion.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch1lev3sec7"><h3 class="title">Touch</h3>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">The meaning of touch is different according to different cultures, past experiences, age, gender, and current setting.</p></li>
<li><p class="">In Western culture, it is regarded as an expression of love. But some cultures avoid touch or it is misinterpreted.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Do not use touch if you do not know how another person will take it.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div><div class="section" id="ch1lev1sec11"><h1 class="title">METHODS OF PHYSICAL EXAMINATION</h1>
<p class="noindent">Health assessment requires techniques, skills, and knowledge. Examiner uses his/her senses, such as sight, smell, touch, and hearing to gather data during physical examination. The techniques that are required in health assessment are inspection, palpation, percussion, and auscultation.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch1lev2sec21"><h2 class="title">Inspection (Fig.1.4)</h2>
<p class="noindent">Visual examination of the body is called inspection. It is the observation with the naked eyes to determine the structure and functions of the body. Observe the client while facing him/her in the bed or chair. Observe the client's skin color and texture; check for lesions and hair distribution. Look at overall body structure. If the client can be out of bed, observe gait and stance. Note all parts of the body as the examination proceeds. Inspection also evaluates verbal and behavioral responses and mental status.</p>
<div class="figure" id="ch1fig4" data-label="Fig. 1.4"><div class="title"><span class="item-label">Fig. 1.4</span> Inspection.</div><img alt="Fig. 1.4" src="/MediumImage/8-1.jpg"><div class="additional-markup"></div></div>
<p class="noindent"><a name="page9"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">9</span></span></p>
<p class="indent">The following principles should be kept in mind for making accurate inspections:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Good lighting and exposure are essential.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Inspect each area for size, shape, color, symmetry and proposition and find out any deviations from normal.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Use additional lights for examining body cavities, e.g., oral.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Use sense of olfaction along with visual to detect abnormalities, e.g., bad breath indicates unhygienic mouth conditions acidotic smell is significant of diabetic acidosis.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch1lev2sec22"><h2 class="title">Assessment through Inspection</h2>
<p class="noindent">While observation of all the aspects mentioned in this chapter is essential, one of the most important skills a nurse develops is the ability to look at a client and determine whether they are comfortable. A client's comfort depends on many things, the most basic of which are that needs for hygiene, posture, maintenance of body temperature and freedom from pain are met. looking at a client:</p>

<p class="indent">As well as observing and assessing the client and their needs, the nurse must also use the sense of sight to assess the functioning of equipment used in client care. Nurses assess various items of equipment to determine whether they are functioning correctly when they are in use, for example:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">

<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">The initial act of physical examination is the inspection of the body as a whole. Most clinicians believe that composite pictures of disease, although composed of many sighs, strike them at a glance; they attempt to teach others perceive likewise.</p></li>
<li><p class="">In looking at the patient as a whole, many facts are noted methods in physical examination/inspection.</p></li>
<li><p class="">General inspection about motor activity, body builds outstanding anatomic malformation, behavior, speech, nutrition, and appearance of illness.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch1lev2sec24"><h2 class="title">Local Inspection</h2>
<p class="noindent">Focusing observation on a single anatomic region yields hundreds of physical signs. Since only signs perceived by inspection can be illustrated, the myriad of pictures used in books on surgical diagnosis hint the importance of the method in that field. The dermatologist relies almost entirely on the appearance of skin lesions to make a diagnosis.<a name="page10"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">10</span></span></p>
<p class="indent">Usage more or less confines the term inspection to observation with the unaided eyes. Actually, visual, visual signs are the chief or only rewards in the use of the ophthalmoscope, slit lamp, gonioscope, otoscope, nasoscope, larynogoscope, bronchoscope, gastrocope, thoracoscope, peritoneoscope, cystoscope, anoscope, and sigmoidoscope. The pathologist uses the microscope; the radiologist inspects the fluroscopic screen and photographic films.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch1lev2sec25"><h2 class="title">Palpation</h2>
<p class="noindent">It is the feeling of the body or a part with the hands to note the size and positions of the organs. In palpation, the finger pads and not the finger tips are used.</p>
<p class="indent">Obtain information by using the hands and fingers to palpate. A light or deep palpation depends on the area being palpated. The palmar surface of fingers and finger pads are used to determine position of the organs, size and consistency, fluid accumulation, pain, and masses. The ulnar surface of the hand is used to distinguish vibration and temperature. The moisture and warmth of the skin can also be determined during palpation.</p>
<p class="indent">The following points are to be kept in mind while doing palpation:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">The client should be relaxed and comfortable. Observe nonverbal signs of discomfort during palpation.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Palpation to be done with warm hands, short fingernails and a gentle approach.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Palpation to be done slowly, and gently</p></li>
<li><p class="">For light palpation the hand is depressed about 1 cm (1/2 inch) and for deeper palpation it should be approximately 2.5 cm (1 inch).</p></li>
<li><p class="">Use appropriate parts of the hands for doing various palpations. The usual definition of palpation is the act of feeling by the sense of touch. But this is too limited; when the physician lays his lands upon the patient, he perceives physical signs by his tactile sense, temperature sense, and his kinesthetic sense of position and vibration.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">Palpation is widely used in the physical examination especially in the abdomen examination. <bold><a href="#ch1fig5" class="ulink-inter">Figure 1.5</a></bold> shows examination of neck.</p>

<div class="section" id="ch1lev3sec16"><h3 class="title">Light Palpation</h3>
<p class="noindent">Light palpation is done more frequently than deep palpation and is always performed before deep palpation. As the name implies, light palpation is superficial, delicate, and gentle. In light palpation, the finger pads are used to gain information on the patient's skin surface to a depth of approximately 1 centimeter (cm) below the surface. Light palpation reveals information on skin texture and moisture; overt, large, or superficial masses; and fluid, muscle guarding, and superficial tenderness. To perform light palpation:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Keeping the fingers of your dominant hand together, place the finger pads lightly on the skin over the area that is to be palpated. The hand and forearm will be on a plane parallel to the area being assessed.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Depress the skin 1 cm in light, gentle, circular motions.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Keeping the finger pads on the skin, let the depressed body surface rebound to its natural position.</p></li>
<li><p class="">If the patient is ticklish, lift the hand off the skin before moving it to another area.<a name="page11"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">11</span></span></p></li>
<li><p class="">Using a systematic approach move the fingers to an adjacent area and repeat the process.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Continue to move the finger pads until the entire area being examined has been palpated.</p></li>
<li><p class="">If the patient has complained of tenderness in any area, palpate this area last.</p></li>

<div class="section" id="ch1lev2sec26"><h2 class="title">Percussion</h2>
<p class="noindent">It is the examination by tapping with the fingers on the body to determine the condition of the internal organs by the sounds that are produced. It is done by placing a finger of the left hand firmly against a part to be examined and tapping with the finger tips of the right hand. Produces sound waves by using the fingers as a hammer. Place the interphalangeal joint of the middle finger on the skin surface of the nondominant hand. Using the tip of the middle finger of the dominant hand, strike the placed finger. Vibration is produced by the impact of the fingers striking against underlying tissue. Sound or tone of the vibration is determined by body area or organ percussed. Normal lung areas produce a resonance sound; liver sounds are dull and a flat sound is heard over muscle.</p>
<p class="noindent"><bold>Characteristics of sound produced are:</bold></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Resonance:</bold> A low pitched and loud sound heard over the normal lung tissues.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Hyperresonance:</bold> Very loud, very low pitch sound longer than resonance and is of booming quality signifies emphysema.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Tympany:</bold> A drum-like sound heard over the air-filled tissues, such as gastric air bubble.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Dull:</bold> A medium-pitched sound with a medium duration without resonance heard over solid tissues, such as heart and liver.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Flat:</bold> A high-pitched sound with a short duration without resonance heard over complete solid tissues, such as hand, thigh. In physical diagnosis, percussion is the method of examination in which the surface of the body is struck to emit sounds that vary in quality according to the underlying tissues. <bold><a href="#ch1fig7" class="ulink-inter">Figure 1.7</a></bold> shows percussion technique and <bold><a href="#ch1tbl2" class="ulink-inter">Table 1.2</a></bold> summarizes area percussed.</p></li>

<div class="section" id="ch1lev3sec21"><h3 class="title">Types of Percussion</h3>
<p class="noindent">There are four types of percussion techniques—immediate, mediate, direct fist percussion, and indirect fist percussion. It is important to keep in mind that the sounds produced from percussion are generated from body tissue up to 5 cm below the surface of the skin. If the abdomen is to be percussed, the patient should have the opportunity to void before the assessment.</p>

<div class="section" id="ch1lev3sec22"><h3 class="title">Immediate Percussion</h3>
<p class="noindent">Immediate or direct percussion is the striking of an area of the body directly. To perform immediate percussion:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Spread the index or middle finger of the dominant hand slightly apart from the rest of the fingers.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Make a light tapping motion with the finger pad of the index finger against the body part being percussed.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Note what sound is produced.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch1lev3sec23"><h3 class="title">Mediate Percussion</h3>
<p class="noindent">Mediate percussion is also referred to as indirect percussion. This is a skill that takes time and practice to develop and to use effectively. Most sounds are produced using mediate percussion. Follow these steps to perform mediate percussion:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p class="">Place the nondominant hand lightly on the surface to be percussed.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Extend the middle finger of this hand, known as the pleximeter, and press its distal phalanx and distal interphalangeal joint firmly on the location where percussion is to begin. The pleximeter will remain stationary while percussion is performed in this location.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Spread the other fingers of the nondominant hand apart and raise them slightly off the surface. This prevents interference and, thus, dampening of vibrations during the actual percussion.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Flex the middle finger of the dominant hand, called the plexor. The fingernail of the plexor finger should be very short to prevent undue discomfort and injury to the nurse. The other fingers on this hand should be fanned.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Flex the wrist of the dominant hand and place the hand directly over the pleximeter finger of the nondominant hand.</p></li>
<li><p class="">With a sharp, crisp, rapid movement from the wrist of the dominant hand, strike the pleximeter with the plexor. At this point, the plexor should be perpendicular to the pleximeter. The blow to the pleximeter should be between the distal interphalangeal joint and the fingernail. Use the finger pad rather than the fingertip of the plexor to deliver the blow. Concentrate on the movement to create the striking action from the dominant wrist only.</p></li>
<li><p class="">As soon as the plexor strikes the pleximeter, withdraw the plexor to avoid dampening the resulting vibrations. Do not move the pleximeter finger.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Note the sound produced from the percussion.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Repeat the percussion process one or two times in this location to confirm the sound.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Move the pleximeter to a second location, preferably the contralateral location from where the previous percussion was performed. Repeat the percussion process in this manner until the entire body surface area being assessed has been percussed. <bold><a href="#ch1fig8" class="ulink-inter">Figure 1.8</a></bold> shows characteristics of percussion notes.</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch1lev3sec24"><h3 class="title">Direct Fist Percussion</h3>
<p class="noindent">Direct fist percussion is used to assess the presence of tenderness and pain in internal organs, such as the liver or the kidneys. To perform direct fist percussion:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Explain this technique thoroughly so the patient does not think you are hitting him/her.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Draw the dominant hand up into a fist.</p></li>
<li><p class="">With the ulnar aspect of the closed fist, directly hit the area where the organ is located. The strike should be of moderate force, and it may take some practice to achieve the right intensity. The presence of pain in conjunction with direct fist percussion indicates inflammation of that organ or a strike of too high an intensity.</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class=""><bold>Methods of percussion:</bold></p>

<div class="section" id="ch1lev3sec25"><h3 class="title">Indirect Fist Percussion</h3>
<p class="noindent">The purpose of indirect fist percussion is the same as direct fist percussion. In fact, the indirect method is preferred over the direct method. It is performed in the following manner:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Place the palmar side of the nondominant hand on the skin's surface over the organ to be examined. Place the fingers adjacent to one another and in straight alignment with the palm.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Draw up the dominant hand into a closed fist.</p></li>
<li><p class="">With the ulnar aspect of the closed fist, use moderate intensity to hit the outstretched nondominant hand on the dorsum. The nondominant hand absorbs some of the force of the striking hand. The resulting intensity should be of sufficient force to produce pain in the patient if organ inflammation is present. <bold><a href="#ch1fig9" class="ulink-inter">Figure 1.9</a></bold> shows percussion sound.</p></li>

<div class="section" id="ch1lev3sec26"><h3 class="title">Methods of Percussion</h3>
<p class="noindent">The percussion can be done by two methods. These are:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p class=""><bold>Direct percussion:</bold> Striking the body surface directly with one or two fingers, e.g., ascitic thrill.<a name="page14"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">14</span></span></p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Indirect percussion:</bold> Placing the middle finger of the non-dominant hand firmly against the body surface and striking the distal joint of now-dominant finger with the middle fingers of the dominant hand.</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="indent">In the method the left middle finger is laid upon the body surface to serve as a pleximeter; it is struck sharp blow with the tip of the right middle finger, the plexor immediate or direct. The body surface is struck directly with one or more fingers of a hand.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch1lev3sec27"><h3 class="title">Sonorous Percussion</h3>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">This term is applied to any method of percussion when its purpose is to ascertain the density of the tissue by the sound emitted when struck.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Various densities emit sounds given special meanings. The percussion notes may be arranged in sequence according to the density that produces them, from least to most dense: tympany hyperresonance, resonance, impaired resonance, dullness, flatness.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Certain steps in normal tissues. Tympany is the sound emitted by percussing the air-filled stomach; resonance is produced by striking the air-filled lungs; flatness results from the thigh.</p></li>
<li><p class="">In general the pitch or frequency of the sounds progresses through the series from lowest for tympany to highest for flatness; the duration of the sound ranges in the series from long to short.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Sonorous percussion is employed to ascertain the density of the lungs, the pleural space, the pleural layers, and the hollow viscera of the abdomen.</p></li>

<p class="noindent">It is the listening to sounds within the body with the aid of a stethoscope, fetoscope or directly with the ear placed on the body. Place the stethoscope on the client's bare skin to listen for the presence and characteristics of sound waves. The bell of the stethoscope is used to detect low-pitched sounds; the diaphragm detects high-pitched sounds. Note variations in intensity, pitch, duration, and quality.</p>

<p class="indent">This is an important physical examination technique used by your healthcare provider, where he or she will listen to your heart, lungs, neck or abdomen, to identify if any problems are present. Auscultation is often performed by using a stethoscope. The stethoscope will amplify sounds heard in the area that is being listened to. If there is an abnormal finding on your examination, further testing may be suggested.</p>

<div class="section" id="ch1lev4sec2"><h4 class="title">Indirect Auscultation</h4>
<p class="noindent">Indirect or mediate auscultation describes the process of listening with some amplification or mechanical device. The nurse most often performs mediate auscultation with an acoustic stethoscope, which does not amplify the body sounds, but instead blocks out environmental sounds. Amplification of body sounds can also be achieved with the use of a Doppler ultrasonic stethoscope.</p>
<p class="indent">This text describes the use of an acoustic stethoscope</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>The neck:</bold> When your doctor or healthcare provider is listening to your neck, they are often listening for a “swishing” sound in your arteries. This may suggest that there is a narrowing of the arteries, which would increase the sound of blood flow.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>The heart:</bold> Normally, your heart produces a “lub-dub” sound, when the heart valves are opening and closing during the flow of blood. Your healthcare provider will listen to see if your heart is beating regularly, or if there are any murmurs (extra sounds with every heart beat). Heart murmurs may be “innocent”, meaning they are normal, and non-life threatening, or they may signify a problem may be present. To diagnose this, your healthcare provider may listen with their stethoscope to many areas around the heart, instead of just one area, and suggest further testing, if necessary.<a name="page15"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">15</span></span></p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>The lungs:</bold> The healthcare provider may listen to your lungs with their stethoscope, anywhere on your back (posterior), or on the front of your chest wall (anterior). He/she may be able to tell if air is moving to the bottom of your lungs, by listening to the airflow in and out of your lungs with each breath. These are called normal lung sounds. If there is a blockage, constriction or narrowing of your lung tubes, or fluid in your lungs, this can be heard by the examiner <bold>(<a href="#ch1tbl3" class="ulink-inter">Table 1.3</a>)</bold>.</p></li>

<p class="noindent">Reflexes are automatic muscular responses to a stimulus. When reflexes are absent or otherwise altered, it can indicate a neurological deficit even earlier than other signs and symptoms of the neurological deficit appear. Reflexes can be described as primitive and long term. Primitive reflexes are normally present at the time of birth and these reflexes normally disappear as the baby grows older; neurological deficits are suspected when these primitive reflexes remain beyond the point in time when they are expected to disappear. Reflexes, other than the primitive reflexes remain intact and active during the entire life span, under normal conditions <bold>(<a href="#ch1fig14" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 1.14</a>)</bold>.<a name="page17"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">17</span></span></p>

<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Rooting reflex:</bold> The infant will turn their head in the direction of the side of the face that is being gently stroked and, then, the infant will begin a sucking action.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Sucking reflex:</bold> The sucking reflex is demonstrated when the infant performs sucking actions when anything like a nipple or a finger tip comes in contact with the infant's mouth.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Tonic neck reflex:</bold> The tonic neck reflex, also referred to as the fencing reflex, is demonstrated when the infant's body takes on the appearance of a fencer's position when the infant's head is turned to the right or to the left.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Galant or truncal incurvation reflex:</bold> This reflex is seen when the infant moves their hips toward the direction of gentle tap on their back near the spine when the infant is in the prone position.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Grasp reflex:</bold> Newborns grasp fingers and other objects that are placed in their palm. They will also tighten their grasp as the finger or another object is slowly removed.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Moro or startle reflex:</bold> This reflex normally occurs with a sudden noise, such as clapping of hands. The infant will jerk when the sound is heard. The infant's head and legs will extend and the arms will move upward.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Step reflex:</bold> Newborns will perform walking like movements when the soles of the infant's feet touch a surface, such as a floor. The reflex disappears in about six to eight weeks of age. <bold><a href="#ch1fig15" class="ulink-inter">Figure 1.15</a></bold> shows examining gag reflexes.</p></li>

<li><p class=""><bold>Pupil reflex:</bold> Pupil reflexes include pupil dilation and pupil accommodation. The “PERLA” mnemonic for pupil reflexes stands for Pupils Equally Reactive to Light and Accommodation which is a normal finding. The pupil reflexes for their reactions to light are assessed by using a flash light in a darkened room. Pupils will normally dilate as the light is withdrawn and they will normally constrict when the light is brought close to the pupils. The pupils are assessed not only for their reaction to light, they are also assessed in terms of their accommodation. Normally, the pupils will dilate when an object is moved away from the eye and they will constrict as the object is being brought closer to the eye.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Plantar reflex:</bold> The plantar reflex is elicited when the person performing this assessment strokes the bottom of the foot and the client's toes curl down. The Babinski sign occurs when the foot goes into dorsiflexion and the great toe curls up; this sign is an abnormal response to this stimulation and it can indicate the presence of deep vein thrombosis.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Biceps reflex</bold>: This reflex is assessed by placing the thumb on the biceps tendon while the person is in a sitting position and then tapping the thumb with the Taylor hammer.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Triceps reflex</bold>: This reflex is elicited by tapping the triceps tendon with the Taylor hammer above the elbow while the client has their hands on their legs when the client is in a sitting position.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Patellar tendon reflex</bold>: This reflex, often referred to as the knee jerk reflex, is elicited by tapping the patellar area with the Taylor hammer.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Calcaneal reflex</bold>: This reflex, often referred to as the Achilles reflex, is assessed with tapping on the calcaneal reflex on the ankle with the Taylor hammer.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Gag reflex</bold>: The gag reflex is elicited when the back of the mouth and the posterior tongue is stimulated with a tongue blade.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Sneeze reflex</bold>: Sneezing occurs to rid the nasal passages of irritants.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Blinking reflex</bold>: This reflex is elicited when the eyes are touched or they are stimulated a sudden bright light or an irritant.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Cough reflex:</bold> Coughing occurs when the airway is stimulated.</p></li>

<p class="noindent">A total client assessment begins with a nursing health history. Using open-ended questions, such as “Tell me about..,” collect data about past health conditions, current problems, and present needs. The information is obtained through objective (observed) and subjective (stated by client) data collection <bold>(<a href="#ch1fig17" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 1.17</a>)</bold>.</p>
<p class="indent">Information obtained from the interview and the physical assessment constitutes the basis for identifying nursing diagnoses and establishing the individualized client care plan. A complete health history includes the following elements:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Biographic information:</bold> Age, sex, educational level, marital status, living arrangements.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Chief complaint:</bold> Condition that brought client to healthcare facility; reason for visit; any recent changes.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Present health status or illness:</bold> Onset of the problem; clinical manifestations, including severity of symptoms; pain characteristics if present.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Health history:</bold> General state of health, past illnesses, surgeries, hospitalizations, allergies, over the counter (OTC's) medications, herbal supplements, current medications, and general habits, such as smoking, alcohol consumption, or recreational drug use.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Family history:</bold> Age and health status of parents, siblings, and children; cause of death for immediate family members.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Psychosocial factors, lifestyles:</bold> Cultural beliefs that influence health management; religious or spiritual beliefs.</p></li>

<div class="section" id="ch1lev2sec31"><h2 class="title">Present Health Status</h2>
<p class="noindent">Obtaining information about a patient's present health status allows the nurse to investigate current complaints. The mnemonic, PQRST, utilizes a structured format for information gathering, including evaluation of pain, and provides an efficient methodology to communicate with other healthcare providers. Use PQRST to assess each symptom and after any intervention to evaluate any changes or responses to treatment</p>

For women, include history of menstrual cycle, how many pregnancies and how many births.</p>
<p class="noindent"><bold>Childhood illnesses:</bold> Data related to childhood illnesses is more pertinent to children than adults and the elderly. For adults, you want to know if they have ever had rheumatic fever and if their tetanus and hepatitis B vaccinations are current. For the elderly, you may want to ask if they ever had polio, rheumatic fever, or chickenpox. Pertinent vaccinations for the elderly would include tetanus, pneumonia and influenza.</p>

<p class="noindent">The mental assessment is completed throughout the physical assessment during the history taking. It is not generally considered a separate entity. Mood, memory, orientation, and thought processes can be evaluated while obtaining the health history. Nutritional preferences and restrictions can be determined as a part of a client care plan and may/may not be included in the general client assessment.</p>
<p class="indent">A spiritual assessment can be obtained as a part of the health history, although specific sociocultural beliefs may need to be ascertained separately. The purpose of a spiritual assessment is to facilitate the client adapting to the hospital environment and to help the staff understand stressors the client may be experiencing as a result of belief systems. The purpose of a mental status assessment is to evaluate the present state of psychologic functioning and to monitor safety needs of the client. It is not designed to make a diagnosis; rather it should yield data that contribute to the total picture of the client as he/she is functioning at the time the assessment is made. The specific rationale for completing a mental status assessment is:</p>

<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Always dress in a clean, professional manner; make sure your name pin or workplace identification is visible.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Remove all bracelets, necklaces, or earrings that can interfere with the physical assessment.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Be sure that your fingernails are short and your hands are warm for maximum patient comfort.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Be sure your hair will not fall forward and obstruct your vision or touch the patient.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Arrange for a well-lit, warm, and private room.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Ensure that all the necessary equipment is ready for use and within reach.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Introduce yourself to the patient: “My name is Veronica Rojas. I am the nurse who is caring for you today. I need to assess how your lungs are today.”</p></li>
<li><p class="">Clarify with the patient how he/she wishes to be addressed: Miss Jones, José, Dr Casy, Rev. Grimes, etc.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Explain what you plan to do and how long it will take; allow the patient to ask questions.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Instruct the patient to undress; the underpants can be left on until the end of the assessment; provide a gown and drape for the patient and explain how to use them.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Allow the patient to undress privately; inform the patient when you will return to start the assessment.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Have the patient void prior to the assessment.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Wash your hands in front of the patient to show your concern for cleanliness.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Observe standard precautions and transmission-based precautions, as indicated.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Ensure that the patient is accessible from both sides of the examining bed or table.</p></li>
<li><p class="">If a bed is used, raise the height so that you do not have to bend over to perform the assessment.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Position the patient as dictated by the body system being assessed, for positioning and draping techniques.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Enlist the patient's cooperation by explaining what you are about to do, where it will be done, and how it may feel.</p></li>

<div class="section" id="ch1lev2sec49"><h2 class="title">Neurologic Examination</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">During a physical examination by the healthcare professional, a neurologic examination may be performed. This can be very brief or more detailed depending on concerns and findings. In general, the physical examination is divided into 4 parts—cranial nerve assessment, motor function assessment, sensory function assessment, and assessment of reflexes.<a name="page26"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">26</span></span></p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Cranial nerve assessment:</bold> There are 12 cranial nerves and these arise from the brain. Each nerve has its own function and the assessment of the nerves is done by evaluating each function. For example, testing the gag reflex with the tongue depressor is testing the 9th and 10th cranial nerves.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Motor function assessment is checking a person's gait, muscle strength and coordination. The test where a person is asked to touch their nose then the finger of the examiner, with eyes open then with eyes closed is an example of how coordination may be evaluated.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Sensory function assessment is checking sensations, such as pain, temperature, position sense, crude and fine touch along certain pathways. A test that may used to evaluate this is asking the person to close their eyes and then using a wisp of cotton, ask the person if they can feel the cotton brushed on the skin.</p></li>

The nurse must draw on critical thinking and problem solving skills to make clinical decisions and plan care for the patient being assessed. If any abnormal findings are identified, the nurse must ensure that appropriate action is taken. This may include communicating the findings to the medical team, and the Associate Nurse Unit Manager (ANUM) in charge of the shift. Patients should be continuously assessed for changes in condition while under Reproductive and Child Health (RCH) care and assessments are documented regularly.</p>

<li><p class="">To determine the nature of the treatment or nursing care needed for the patient.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">A comprehensive physical examination should be performed according to age specific preventive health guidelines. American Medical Association clinical practice guidelines recognize the following body areas and organ systems for purpose of the examination:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Body areas:</bold> Head (including the face), neck, chest (including breasts and axillae), abdomen, genitalia, groin, buttocks, back (including spine), and each extremity</p></li>

</div>
<div class="section" id="ch1lev2sec62"><h2 class="title">Approach to Physical Assessment</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Consider the age and developmental stage of the child.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Implement behaviors that show respect for child's age, gender, cultural values and personal preferences.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Modify language and communicate style to be consistent with child's needs.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Introduce yourself to the child and family and establish rapport. Use play techniques for infants and young children.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Gather as much information as possible by observation first</p></li>
<li><p class="">Use systematic approach; but be flexible to accommodate child's behavior.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Examine least intrusive areas first (i.e., hands, arms) and painful and sensitive assessment last (i.e., ears, nose, mouth)</p></li>
<li><p class="">Determine what parts of the exam is to be completed before possible crying which may be seen in some children (i.e., heart, lungs and abdomen)</p></li>
<li><p class="">Encourage the child and family to ask questions and voice any concerns.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Where possible assessments should be clustered with other cares at a time when the child is relaxed and compliant. However the clinical need of the assessment should also be considered against the need for the child to rest. For a stable child it may be appropriate to delay assessments until the child is awake.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Throughout the assessment process, the nurse should refer any serious concerns to the ANUM and to medical team.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch1lev2sec63"><h2 class="title">Measurements</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Body measurements include length or height, weight, and head circumference for children from birth to 36 months of age. Thereafter, body measurements include height and weight.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The assessment of hearing, speech and vision are also measurements of an individual's function in these areas.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The Denver Development Screening Test measures an infant's and young child's gross motor, language, fine motor-adaptive and personal-social development milestones.</p></li>
<li><p class="">If developmental delay is suspected based on an assessment of a parent's development/behavior concern or if delays are suspected after a screening of development benchmarks, a written referral is to a physician or pediatric nurse practitioner is imperative.</p></li>
<li><p class="">A patient's measurements can be compared with a standard, expected, or predictable measurement for age and gender.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Deviation from standards helps identify significant conditions requiring close monitoring or referral to a physician or pediatric nurse practitioner.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The significance of measurements and actions to take when they deviate from normal expectations are age-specific.</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="ch1lev3sec64"><h3 class="title">How to Measure Height</h3>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Obtain height by measuring the recumbent length of children less than 2 years of age and children between 2 and 3 who cannot stand unassisted. A measuring board with a stationary headboard and a sliding vertical foot piece is ideal, but a tape measure can also be used.
<ul style="list-style-type: square">
<li><p class="">Lay the child flat against the center of the board. The head should be held against the headboard by the parent or an assistant and the knees held so that the hips and knees are extended. The foot piece is moved until it is firmly against the child's heels. Read and record the measurement to the nearest 1/8 inch.</p></li>
<li><p class="">A modified technique in home settings is to lay the child flat and straight where the head should be held by the parent and the knees held so that the hips and knees are extended, mark the flat surface at the top of the head and tip of the heels. Move child and measure the distance between the marks with a tape measure. Read and record the measurement to the nearest 1/8 inch.</p></li></ul></p></li>
<li><p class="">When a recumbent length is obtained for a two year old, it should be plotted on the birth to 36 months growth chart. When a standing height is obtained for a 2-year-old, plot the finding on the 2 year to 18 year chart. After plotting measurements for children on age and gender specific growth charts, evaluate, educate and refer according to findings.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Obtain a standing height on children greater than 2 to 3 years of age, adolescents, and adults, using a portable stadiometer. The patient is to be wearing only socks or be bare foot. Have the patient stand with head, shoulder blades, buttocks, and heels touching the wall. The knees are to be straight and feet flat on the floor, and the patient is asked to look straight ahead. The flat surface of the stadiometer is lowered until it touches the crown of the head, compress the hair. A measuring rod attached to a weight scale should not be used.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch1lev3sec65"><h3 class="title">Measuring Weight</h3>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Balance beam or digital scales should be used to weigh patients of all ages. Spring type scales are not acceptable. CDC recommends that all scales should be zero balanced and calibrated. Scales must be checked for accuracy on an annual basis and calibrated in accordance with manufacturer's instructions.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Prior to obtaining weight measurements, make sure the scale is “zeroed”.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Weigh infants wearing only a dry diaper or light undergarments. Weigh children after removing outer clothing and shoes. Weigh adolescents and adults with the patient wearing minimal clothing.<a name="page35"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">35</span></span></p></li>

Less than 6 months use digital thermometer per axilla.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Respiratory rate:</bold> Count the child's breaths for one full minute. Assess any respiratory distress.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Heart rate:</bold> Palpate brachial pulse (preferred in neonates) or femoral pulse in infant and radial pulse in older children. To ensure accuracy, count pulse for a full minute.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Blood pressure:</bold> Baseline measurement should be obtained for every patient. Selection of the cuff size is an important consideration. A rough guide to appropriate cuff size is to ensure it fits a 2/3 width of upper arm. For neonates without previous hospital admissions do a blood pressure on all 4 limbs.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Oxygen saturation:</bold> Monitor as clinically indicated. Note oxygen requirement and delivery mode.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Pain:</bold> Use FLACC, faces, numeric scale, neonatal pain assessment tool as appropriate to the age group. Areas, such as PICU and NICU use specialized pain scales for incubated and sedated patients., e.g., modified pain assessment tool (MPAT), Comfort B. Review current pain relief medications/practices. <bold><a href="#ch1tbl9" class="ulink-inter">Table 1.9</a></bold> shows nursing assessment form.</p></li>

<p class="noindent">The professional nurse plays a vital role in the assessment of patient problems. Educational preparation and the clinical setting in part determine the extent to which the nurse participates in the assessment process. For example, a nurse in primary care may perform a comprehensive physical assessment of patients, while a critical care nurse may conduct selected patient assessments to monitor and evaluate current health problems. In either case, nurses are expected to be familiar with and comfortable using physical assessment skills. Today's nurses are sophisticated professionals who require information in order to make clinical decisions.</p>

<p class="noindent">Assessment is the first step in the nursing process. In this step, nurse systematically collects verifies, analysis and communicates data about the client's health status. It focuses on gathering the data about a client's state of wellbeing, functional ability, physical status, strengths and responses to actual and potential health problems. Recording of collected data should be done systematically. It saves time, energy and man power by helping the nurse to make right diagnosis and treatment.</p>
<div class="sidebar"><h2 class="title">CASE SCENARIO</h2>
<p class=""><bold>Background:</bold> Mrs Gupta is a 45-year-old female who has come to the outpatient department with complaints of severe abdominal pain in the right upper quadrant (RUQ) for the past two days. She describes the pain as sharp and stabbing, with occasional waves of nausea. Mrs Gupta reports no significant past medical history but mentions occasional indigestion. She denies any recent trauma or fall.</p>
<p class=""><bold>Objective:</bold> Perform a comprehensive health assessment and physical examination to gather relevant data and identify potential causes of Mrs Gupta's abdominal pain.</p>
<p class=""><bold>Key information:</bold></p>
<p class=""><bold>Vital signs:</bold></p>
<p class=""><bold>Blood pressure:</bold> 130/80 mm Hg</p>
<p class=""><bold>Heart rate:</bold> 80 bpm</p>
<p class=""><bold>Respiratory rate:</bold> 18 breaths/min</p>
<p class=""><bold>Temperature:</bold> 37°C (98.6°F)</p>
<p class=""><ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p class=""><bold>General appearance:</bold> Mrs Gupta appears uncomfortable and is guarding her right upper abdomen. She is slightly diaphoretic and has a slightly pale complexion.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Abdominal examination:</bold></p>
<p class="">Inspection: Note any visible abnormalities, distension, or masses.</p>
<p class="">Auscultation: Use the stethoscope to listen for bowel sounds in all four quadrants.</p>
<p class="">Percussion: Gently tap each quadrant to assess for dullness or tympany.</p>
<p class="">Palpation: Start with light palpation, assessing for tenderness, guarding, and any masses. Proceed with deeper palpation if well-tolerated.</p>
<p class="">Specific focus on RUQ: Pay special attention to Murphy's sign (palpation in RUQ during inspiration, assessing for pain indicative of gallbladder inflammation).</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Additional assessments:</bold></p>
<p class="">Cardiovascular assessment: Check for jugular venous distension and peripheral edema.</p>
<p class="">Respiratory assessment: Assess lung sounds and observe for any signs of respiratory distress.</p>
<p class="">Neurological assessment: Assess for any signs of altered mental status or neurological deficits.</p>
<p class="">Diagnostic considerations: Based on the assessment, potential differential diagnoses could include:</p>
<p class=""><ul style="list-style-type: dash">
<li><p class="">Acute cholecystitis</p></li>
<li><p class="">Peptic ulcer disease</p></li>

</div><div class="section" id="ch1lev1sec21"><h1 class="title">CONCLUSION</h1>
<p class="noindent">Health assessment is an important component in health care for proper diagnosis and effective treatment. Health assessment includes the following physical assessment: heat to foot examination, system wise examination, recording height and weight, mental status examination, laboratory investigation and special investigation. Techniques of physical assessment are inspection, palpation, percussion, manipulation, auscultation and observation.</p>
<p class="indent">Health assessment of patients falls under the purview of both physicians and nurses. While some nurses practice in extended roles (Advanced Nurse Practitioners), others maintain a more traditional role in the acute care setting. Assessment of patients varies based on both role and setting. A cardiac care nurse will be more familiar with and attuned to cardiac issues. The nursing health assessment is an incredibly valuable tool nurses have in their arsenal of skills. A thorough and skilled assessment allows you, the nurse, to obtain descriptions about your patient's symptoms, how the symptoms developed, and a process to discover any associated physical findings that will aid in the development of differential diagnoses. Assessment uses both subjective and objective data. Subjective assessment factors are those that are reported by the patient. Objective assessment data includes that which is observable and measurable.</p>
