<p class="noindent">The word hygiene has evolved from the Greek term “Hygia” which means “Goodness of Health”. Hygiene is the science of health and includes all factors which contribute to healthful living. Hygiene is the science of health and its preservation; it also refers to practices that are conducive to good health. Good personal hygiene is important to a person's general health. Assisting patients with basic hygiene not only creates a personal connection between the healthcare provider and the patient but also is vital to maintaining the patient's health. It is the responsibility of the healthcare professional to balance the proper amount of grooming. Both too much grooming, as well as too little grooming can have negative effects. There are various health care settings and a variety of patients; thus, it is necessary to determine how much assistance is necessary for each patient on a case by case scenario. Patients should be allowed to assist with their hygiene to the best of their ability. Assistance may be needed for tasks, such as eliminating, shaving, brushing and styling hair, oral care, and bathing.</p>

</div><div class="section" id="ch4lev1sec10"><h1 class="title">BED BATH</h1>
<p class="noindent">Bathing is an important intervention to promote hygiene. Choice of the method depends on the nurse's judgment as well as the medical plan of care in regard to the client's activity level and mental and physical capabilities to perform self-care. Several types of bath can be used depending on the client's need. Baths may be used for cleansing or for therapeutic measures related to some skin problems.</p>
<p class="indent">Assisting patients with bathing is a fundamental aspect of maintaining the patient's hygiene. Bathing not only helps the patient to feel clean and gain a sense of normalcy, but bathing also removes dirt, perspiration, bacteria, and dead skin as well as promotes blood circulation. Bathing practices may vary from patient to patient based on their personal, religious, and individual needs.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">There are a few types of baths that patients may require.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The first type is bathing in a bathroom, which consists of a typical shower or bath. This process is for patients who are ambulatory enough to reach the bathroom and need minimal assistance bathing themselves.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Next is a self-wash in bed; this is for patients who can bathe themselves but are not able to get out of bed.</p></li>
<li><p class="">This approach may also require minimal assistance. Lastly would be a bed bath; this is for patients who cannot get out of bed and cannot bathe themselves.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Bathing in a bed can either use a washbasin filled with water or with pre-packaged cloths that do not require water. <bold><a href="#ch4fig12" class="ulink-inter">Figure 4.12</a></bold> shows the methods of folding sponge towel for bed bath.<a name="page143"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">143</span></span></p></li>
<li><p class="">The wipes that do not require water are known as bag baths. If using a wash bin and cloths, ensure they are single-use items to prevent the spread of bacteria.</p></li>

<p class="noindent">Pressure ulcer (decubitus, bedsore) is defined as localized injury to the skin or underlying tissue over a bony prominence as a result of pressure with friction and shear. Clinical presentation can vary from simple reactive hyperemia to severe osteomyelitis. It is very common in the elderly bed-bound patients, and the most commonly affected body portions are sacrum and heel. <bold><a href="#ch4fig24" class="ulink-inter">Figure 4.24</a></bold> illustrates the stages of pressure sores.</p>
<p class="indent">Prevention of pressure ulcers should be started by primary care givers through education of the patient and the family, and every measure should be undertaken to prevent its development. There are three well-known scaling systems in prediction of pressure ulcers: Norton, Braden and Water low.</p>
<p class="indent"><bold>Norton pressure sore risk assessment</bold> scale scoring system has been the first evaluation scale. It is still widely used today. The total score is the Norton Rating (NR) for that patient and may vary from 20 (minimum risk) to 5 (maximum risk).</p>

<p class="noindent">The perineum is the anatomic area between the urethra, the tube that carries urine from the bladder, and the anus. In women, the perineum includes the vaginal opening. This area undergoes a lot of stress and change during pregnancy and delivery, and it needs special care afterward. It is also defined as perineal-genital care. The perineal area is condusive to the growth of pathogenic organisms because it is warm, moist and it is not well-ventilated. Since there are many orifices example, urinary meatus, vaginal orifice and the anus situated in this area, the pathogenic organisms can enter into the body. Thoroughly cleanliness is essential to prevent bad odor to promote comfort.</p>

<p class="noindent">In choosing clothes, the followings points should be considered durability, comfort and cheapness. Moreover, they should be easily washable, attractive in appearance and simple. The choice of materials for clothes is important. Light weight, loosely woven materials are bad conductors of heat and so are used to conserve the body heat.</p>
<p class="indent">Cotton is good in warm weather as it easily absorbs perspiration and quickly dries, so cooling the body. It is reasonably inexpensive and easy to wash. The choice of colors for. Clothing is important. White and light colors are cool whereas darker colors particularly red and black are warm.</p>
<p class="noindent">The design of clothes is also important. They should be well fitting easy to put on and take off.</p>
<p class="indent">Any necessary elastic should be sufficiently wide to be comfortable and not too tight. Underclothing should be frequently changed. Boys and girls as they grow older should learn to choose their own clothes, should be allowed to develop their own styles and use colors to suit their own personalities.</p>
<p class="indent">The most effective teaching is done by teachers and parents who should set a good example. Damp clothes whether wet from rain or perspiration should be changed immediately to prevent excessive chilling of the body.</p>

<li><p class="">Dentures should be cleaned regularly just like natural teeth. You will want to assist the patient with removing and cleaning them at night (because at night many patients will remove them to sleep) and after meals.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Keep the dentures safe in a denture cup (do not forget to label the denture cup too)! This seems very simple, but in the hospital setting dentures get lost. They may accidently get tossed into the linen bin, left on a food tray, etc. So, always keep them secured in a denture cup when not in use.<a name="page165"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">165</span></span></p></li>

</ul>
<div class="section" id="ch4lev2sec99"><h2 class="title">Definition</h2>
<p class="noindent">Denture care is the maintenance of removable artificial teeth. Full or complete dentures replace all teeth in the upper jaw (maxilla), lower jaw (mandible), or both jaws. Partial dentures replace some teeth.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch4lev2sec100"><h2 class="title">Purpose</h2>
<p class="noindent">Dentures replace natural teeth lost because of a health condition or injury. The artificial teeth fit in the mouth, allowing a person to eat normally. Daily denture care by the patient helps prevent conditions, such as plaque. Periodic dental appointments assure that dentures fit properly and that the patient's mouth is healthy.</p>

<div class="section" id="ch4lev2sec103"><h2 class="title">Preparation</h2>
<p class="noindent">The process for making dentures generally starts with the dentist taking a wax impression of the patient's mouth. A material similar to plaster is poured into the impression to make a model of the teeth. The plaster model is sent to a lab, where a wax denture is made. The dentist fits this denture on the patient and then sends it to the lab where the permanent denture is created.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch4lev2sec104"><h2 class="title">Procedure</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Explain and secure the cooperation of the patient.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Remove the denture and inspect the oral cavity for abnormalities if any.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Wash hands and keep the articles near the bed side sink.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Take a basin and fill half of it with water.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Put on gloves to reduce transmission of infection.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Ask the patient to remove dentures and place them in the basin.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Brush the dentures. Use back and front motion. Clean inside and outside by brushing.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Rinse dentures thoroughly in running water.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Return them to the patient to keep them in a denture cup in cold water.</p></li>
<li><p class="">With a soft bristled tooth brush the gum with tooth paste as well as the palate of tongue also.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Rinse the mouth thoroughly with cold water.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Wipe the face and make the patient comfortable.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Replace the used articles and record the procedure.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch4lev2sec105"><h2 class="title">Precautions</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">In cleaning dentures, they should be held firmly as water reduces friction between the teeth and finger. They are liable to slip and fall down.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Denture should be dipped in cold water to prevent friction.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Hot water may destroy dentures, dentures are expensive and may be difficult to replace if broken or lost.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Privacy should be maintained.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Discourage the use of brushed with hard bristles because they cause grooves in dentures.</p></li>
<li><p class="">If the patient is capable of self-care, arrange the articles within the easy reach of the patient.<a name="page166"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">166</span></span></p></li>
<li><p class="">Encourage the patients to wear the denture during the day. This will improve the eating technique, speech appearance and contour of the mouth.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Seriously-ill patient or a patient who is under anesthesia or an unconscious patient, the denture is removed for fear of dislodging the denture and blocking the respiratory passage.</p></li>
<li><p class="">When dentures are removed from the patient's mouth, they should be stored in a labeled container to prevent lost and breakage.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch4lev2sec106"><h2 class="title">After Care</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">The dental team educates new denture wearers about how to adjust to restorative teeth and clean them.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Dentures should be rinsed to remove food particles. Then the patient brushes natural teeth and dentures to removes plaque and food. The ADA recommends using a toothbrush recommended for dentures or a soft bristle brush.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Dentures can be cleaned with denture cleansers bearing the ADA Seal of Acceptance, mild liquid dish soap, or hand soap.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The new denture wearer is usually advised to wear the full denture most or all of the time.</p></li>
<li><p class="">After an adjustment period, the dentist generally tells the patient to take the dentures out before bedtime. <bold><a href="#ch4fig40" class="ulink-inter">Figure 4.40</a></bold> illustrates the Do's and don'ts in denture care.</p></li>

<div class="section" id="ch4lev2sec107"><h2 class="title">Complications</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Bones and gums may shrink, especially during the first six months after teeth are removed. When shrinkage occurs, the dentist may need to rebase or reline the immediate dentures.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The new denture wearer may experience soreness. This is caused by the pressure of hard dentures on soft tissue and is usually temporary. However, soreness is frequently a sign that dentures need adjusting.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The patient may also experience a temporary increase in saliva flow. If any symptoms persist, patients should contact their dentists.</p></li>

<p class="noindent">Hearing aids are delicate instruments that need attention to ensure good operation <bold>(<a href="#ch4fig41" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 4.41</a>)</bold>. Before you put the hearing aid on your child, you should give it a quick visual inspection and listening check. Here is a checklist you should follow every day:</p>
<div class="section" id="ch4lev2sec108"><h2 class="title">Visual Inspection</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">If the hearing aid has switches and/or volume controls, check them to be sure that they are working.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Check the earmold tubing for cracks, holes or twists.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Make sure the tubing fits snugly onto the hearing aid.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Make sure the earmold opening is free of wax and moisture.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch4lev2sec109"><h2 class="title">Listening Check</h2>
<p class="noindent">A parent or caregiver must listen to the hearing aid every day before putting the hearing aid in the child's ear. Listen for static or crackling sounds. By doing this daily check, you will notice right away if the hearing aid is not working properly. If you think that there is a problem, call your audiologist.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch4lev2sec110"><h2 class="title">Cleaning Hearing Aids and Earmolds</h2>
<p class="noindent">To keep your child's hearing aids and earmolds working well, you must keep them clean and store them safely.</p>

<li><p class="">Check the opening for earwax build-up. If wax is present, gently remove it with a pipe cleaner, tooth pick or wax tool. Do not poke the earmold with sharp objects. Keeping the earmold clean will usually prevent wax from building up.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Test the battery in the hearing aid (your audiologist will show you how at your child's fitting) and change it if it is low.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Wipe off the hearing aid to prevent dirt or moisture from building up.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Turn the hearing aid off and open the battery compartment when it is not in use.</p></li>

<div class="section" id="ch4lev2sec113"><h2 class="title">Care of Hearing Aids</h2>
<p class="noindent">More than 25% of people 65 and older suffer from some degree of hearing loss. That is why, why long-term care facility staff should familiarize themselves with the manufacturer's care instructions for the large variety of hearing aids on the market today. Some general rules for most hearing aids include:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Change the batteries on a regular schedule, or as needed. When changing batteries, hold the hearing aid over a table or bed to prevent breakage from dropping. There are disposable hearing aids that last for 30–40 days with totally enclosed batteries, eliminating the need for battery changes.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Turn the hearing aid to the “off” position when it is not being used.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Place the hearing aid in a container in a secure place when it is removed.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Keep all parts of the hearing aid together.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Do not place a hearing aid in the sun, because the heat can cause damage.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Check the hearing aid for earwax when you remove it, and clean the outside of it with a soft cloth, if necessary.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Remove the hearing aid during showers and baths, as moisture can cause damage. Do not use hair spray when the hearing aid is in place.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Check ears daily for any sign of irritation, inflammation, or drainage. Moisture enclosed in the ear by a tight-fitting hearing aid may cause an infection.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Keep the outer part of the ear clean to prevent dead cells or other debris from entering the ear canal.</p></li>

<p class="noindent">A contact lens or contact is a thin, curved lens inserted directly onto the tear film, which covers the surface of your eye. Although contact lenses are considered to be a medical device, patients wear them for a variety of reasons, including— visual correction, therapeutic or cosmetic reasons. Contacts are either hard, soft or a hybrid.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch4lev2sec114"><h2 class="title">Handling Contact Lenses</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Always wash, rinse, and dry hands before handling contact lenses.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Always use fresh, unexpired lens care solutions.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Use the recommended lens care system and carefully follow instructions on solution labeling. Different solutions cannot always be used together, and not all solutions are safe for use with all lenses. Do not alternate or mix lens care systems unless indicated on solution labeling.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Always remove, clean, rinse, enzyme and disinfect your lenses according to the schedule prescribed by your eye care professional. The use of an enzyme or any cleaning solution does not substitute for disinfection.<a name="page168"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">168</span></span></p></li>
<li><p class="">Do not use saliva or anything other than the recommended solutions for lubricating or rewetting your lenses. Do not put lenses in your mouth.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Lenses prescribed in a frequent replacement program should be thrown away after the expiration of the wearing period prescribed by your eye care professional.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Never rinse your lenses in water from the tap. There are two reasons for this:
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p class="">Tap water contains many impurities that can contaminate or damage your lenses and may lead to eye infection or injury.</p></li>
<li><p class="">You might lose the lens down the drain.</p></li>
</ol>
</p></li>
<li><p class="">Clean one lens first (always the same lens first to avoid mix-ups), rinse the lens thoroughly with recommended saline or disinfecting solution to remove the cleaning solution, mucus, and film from the lens surface. Follow the instructions provided in the cleaning solution labeling. Put that lens into the correct chamber of the lens storage case. Then repeat the procedure for the second lens.</p></li>
<li><p class="">After cleaning, and rinsing, disinfect lenses using the system recommended by your eye care professional. Follow the instructions provided in the disinfection solution labeling.</p></li>
<li><p class="">To store lenses, disinfect and leave them in the closed/unopened case until ready to wear. If lenses are not to be used immediately after disinfection, you should consult the labeling of the storage solution for information on lens storage.</p></li>
<li><p class="">After removing your lenses from the lens case, empty and rinse the lens storage case with solution(s) recommended by the lens case manufacturer; then allow the lens case to air dry. When the case is used again, refill it with fresh storage solution. Replace lens case at regular intervals.</p></li>

</div>
<div class="section" id="ch4lev2sec115"><h2 class="title">The Products Cleaning, Rinsing and Disinfecting Solutions</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Saline solution is for rinsing and storing contact lenses when using a heat or UV disinfection system. You also may need it for use with enzymatic cleaning tablets or cleaning/disinfecting devices. Saline is only a rinsing agent; it does not disinfect.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Daily cleaner is for cleaning your contact lenses. You place a few drops in the palm of your hand and carefully rub the lens for as long as directed (usually about 20 seconds, making sure to clean both sides of your lenses. Use other products for rinsing and disinfection.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Multipurpose solution is for cleaning, rinsing, disinfecting and storing your contact lenses. Clean your lenses as you would with daily cleaner, then rinse and disinfect, all with the same solution; or rinse the lenses twice, then place them in the clean lens case with solution to clean and disinfect. When you are ready to wear the lenses, rinse them again. With multipurpose solutions, often no other lens care products are needed.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Hydrogen peroxide is for cleaning and disinfection solution. With this product, you place your lenses in the provided basket and rinse them, then place the basket in its cup and fill the cup with solution to clean and disinfect your lenses.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Some lens holders for hydrogen peroxide systems have a built-in neutralizer (to convert the hydrogen peroxide to water, so it does not sting your eyes), but with others you need to add a neutralizing tablet.</p></li>
<li><p class="">After the disinfection and neutralizing step is completed, you can remove the lenses from the case and put them on.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Never rinse your contacts with hydrogen peroxide solution and apply them directly to your eyes without completing the entire disinfecting and neutralizing step. Doing so can cause a painful chemical injury to the eye.<a name="page169"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">169</span></span></p></li>
<li><p class="">Cleaning/disinfecting devices will, as you would expect, both clean and disinfect your contact lenses. Depending on how the brand is designed, cleaning is accomplished with either ultrasonic waves or subsonic agitation, whereas disinfection occurs via multipurpose solution or ultraviolet light.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Instructions for these devices are all a little different. In general, you first rinse the lenses, using either saline or multipurpose solution as directed. One brand requires rubbing with the saline, but most are no-rub.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Then, put your contact lenses in the device and fill it with the same type of solution as for the rinse.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Place the lid on the device and plug it into clean and disinfect your lenses.</p></li>

<p class="noindent">Personal hygiene includes all those personal factors which influence the health and well-being of an individual. It consists of the body regarding bathing and washing, care of hair, nails and feet, mouth cleanliness and care of the teeth, care of the nose and ears, clothing, postures, exercises, recreation, rest and relaxation, sleep habits and nutrition. The nurse has to implement the nursing care plan to provide optimum quality of nursing care for the individual patients. The nurse must apply knowledge of pathophysiology to provide good preventive hygienic care. The nurse has to integrate knowledge of anatomy, physiology and pathology during hygienic care.</p>
