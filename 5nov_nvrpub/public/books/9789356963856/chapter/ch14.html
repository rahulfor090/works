</div><div class="section" id="ch14lev1sec2"><h1 class="title">INTRODUCTION</h1>
<p class="noindent">Stress is a fact of everyday life and it can be defined either as a reaction or as a stimulus. Over the years and with the progress of science many factors have been identified as sources of stress, such as Biological, Chemicals, Microbial, Psychological, Developmental, Socio-cultural and Environmental. Stress is normal and, to some extent, a necessary part of life. Despite it being something everyone experiences, what causes stress can differ from person to person. For instance, one person may become angry and overwhelmed by a serious traffic jam, while another might turn up their music and consider it a mild inconvenience. A fight with a friend might follow one person around for the rest of the day, while another might easily shrug it off <bold>(<a href="#ch14fig1" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 14.1</a>)</bold>.</p>
</div><div class="section" id="ch14lev1sec3"><h1 class="title">DEFINITION</h1>
<p class="noindent">Stress is a normal reaction the body has when changes occur, resulting in physical, emotional and intellectual responses. Stress management training can help you deal with changes in a healthier way.</p>
</div><div class="section" id="ch14lev1sec4"><h1 class="title">MEANING OF STRESS</h1>
<p class="noindent">The term stress means pressure and in human life it represents an uneasy experience. It is an unpleasant psychological and physiological state caused due to some internal and or external demands that go beyond our capacity.<a name="page559"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">559</span></span> Body coping mechanism with stress. Each person has his own normal (homeostatic) level of arousal at which the functions best. If something unusual in the environment occurs, this level of arousal is affected. Eustress is a normal response, i.e., fight or flight response, such as the sensation after a near-miss with another car. Distress occurs when the elevated blood pressure does not return to normal in between stressors, i.e., stressors that come one after the other all day at work. Severe distress shows up as burnout, obesity, clinical hypertension after prolonged distress without adequate recovery time, such as single parenting or working for a jerk or with malicious co-workers.</p>

</div><div class="section" id="ch14lev1sec5"><h1 class="title">SOURCES OF STRESS</h1>
<p class="noindent">Stress is a normal human reaction that happens to everyone. In fact, the human body is designed to experience stress and react to it. When you experience changes or challenges (stressors), your body produces physical and mental responses. That's stress. Stress responses help your body adjust to new situations. Stress can be positive, keeping us alert, motivated and ready to avoid danger. For example, if you have an important test coming up, a stress response might help your body work harder and stay awake longer. But stress becomes a problem when stressors continue without relief or periods of relaxation.</p>

<p class="noindent">Sometimes stress can be brief, and specific to the demands and pressures of a particular situation, such as a deadline, a performance or facing up to a difficult challenge or traumatic event. This type of stress often gets called acute stress.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch14lev3sec1"><h3 class="title">Episodic Acute Stress</h3>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Some people seem to experience acute stress over and over. This is sometimes referred to as episodic acute stress.</p></li>
<li><p class="">These kind of repetitive stress episodes may be due to a series of very real stressful challenges, for example, losing a job, then developing health problems, followed by difficulties for a child in the school setting.</p></li>
<li><p class="">For some people, episodic acute stress is a combination of real challenges and a tendency to operate like a ‘stress machine’.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Some people tend to worry endlessly about bad things that could happen, are frequently in a rush and impatient with too many demands on their time, which can contribute to episodic acute stress.</p></li>

<div class="section" id="ch14lev2sec7"><h2 class="title">Physical Stress</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">A common type of stress is physical stress, which refers to actual physical activities and events that wreak havoc on the human body. One good example is travel.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Traveling frequently can send you to different time zones, which makes sleeping and waking difficult.</p></li>

<li><p class="">Traumatic stress is a type of stress that occurs because of some type of trauma to the human body and may lead to intense pain, coma or even death.</p></li>
<li><p class="">It often relates to some kind of physical change that occurs.</p></li>
<li><p class="">If you went through an operation, your body may experience stress until you recover from that surgery.</p></li>

<p class="noindent">These are events, situations, individuals, comments, or anything we interpret as negative or threatening (i.e., not being able to find a babysitter for your sick child when you cannot take time off work).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch14lev2sec12"><h2 class="title">Absolute Stressors</h2>
<p class="noindent">These are stressors that everyone exposed to them would interpret as being stressful. These are objective stressors that are universal (i.e., earth quakes, a tsunami, or the events of September 11th 2001).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch14lev2sec13"><h2 class="title">Relative Stressors</h2>
<p class="noindent">These are stressors that only some exposed to them would interpret as being stressful. These are subjective stressors that cause different reactions in different people (i.e., time pressure at work, traffic, paying taxes, writing an exam).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch14lev2sec14"><h2 class="title">Acute Time-limited Stressors</h2>
<p class="noindent">Acute time-limited stressors are ones given in a controlled environment, such as a lab. If you are part of a study, the tech may present you with a stimulus that causes some level of anxiety for you. This could be presenting you with something that you have a phobia of or making you do something you do not feel comfortable doing. The stressor sparks intense stress but only for the time it takes to illicit a response.</p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="ch14lev2sec17"><h2 class="title">Chronic Stressors</h2>

<p class="noindent">Homeostatic mechanisms are aimed at counteracting the everyday stress of living. If they are successful, the internal environment maintains normal physiological limits of temperature, chemistry and pressure. If stress is extreme or long lasting, the normal mechanisms may not be sufficient. In this case, the stress triggers a wide-ranging set of bodily changes called General Adaptation Syndrome. When stress appears, it stimulates the hypothalamus to initiate the GAS through two pathways:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p class="">The first pathway is stimulation of the sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system and adrenal medulla. This produces an immediate set of responses called the alarm reaction.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The second pathway, called the resistance reaction involves the anterior pituitary gland and adrenal cortex; the resistance reaction is slower to start, but its effects last longer.</p></li>
</ol>

<div class="section" id="ch14lev2sec19"><h2 class="title">Alarm Reaction</h2>
<p class="noindent">The alarm reaction or fight-or-flight response is the body's initial reaction to a stressor. It is a set of reactions initiated when the hypothalamus stimulates the sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system, and the adrenal medulla. The alarm reaction is meant to counteract a danger by mobilizing the body's resources for immediate physical activity. The stress responses which characterize the alarm reaction include the following:<a name="page565"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">565</span></span></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Heart rate and strength of cardiac muscle contraction increases; this circulates blood quickly to areas where it is needed to fight the stress.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Blood vessels supplying skin and viscera, except heart and lungs, constrict; at the same time blood vessels supplying skeletal muscles and brain dilate; these responses route more blood to organs active in the stress responses, thus decreasing blood supply to organs which do not assume an immediate active role.</p></li>
<li><p class="">RBC production is increased leading to an increase in the ability of the blood to clot. This helps control bleeding.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Liver converts glycogen into glucose and releases it into the bloodstream; this provides the energy needed to fight the stressor.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The rate of breathing increases and respiratory passages widen to accommodate more air; this enables body to acquire more oxygen.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Production of saliva and digestive enzymes reduces. This reaction takes place as digestive activity is not essential for counteracting stress.</p></li>
</ul>

</div>
<div class="section" id="ch14lev2sec20"><h2 class="title">Resistance Reaction</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">The resistance reaction is the second stage in the stress response. It is initiated by regulating hormones secreted by the hypothalamus, and is a long-term reaction. These regulating hormones are corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) and thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH).</p></li>
<li><p class="">CRH stimulates the anterior pituitary to increase its secretion of adreno corticotropic hormone (ACTH). ACTH stimulates the adrenal cortex to secrete more of its hormones. The action of these hormones helps to control bleeding, maintain blood pressure, etc.</p></li>
<li><p class="">GHRH stimulates the anterior pituitary to secrete human growth hormone (HGH). TRH causes the anterior pituitary to secrete thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). The combined actions of (HGH) and TSH help to supply additional energy to the body.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The resistance reaction allows the body to continue fighting a stressor for a long time. Thus, it helps us to meet emotional crisis, perform strenuous tasks, fight infection, or resist the threat of bleeding to death.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Generally, the resistance reaction is successful in helping us cope with a stressful situation, and our bodies then return to normal. Occasionally, it fails to fight the stressor, especially if it is too severe or long-lasting. In this case, the general adaptation syndrome (GAS) moves into the stage of exhaustion.</p></li>

<li><p class="">Inflammatory response—is stimulated by trauma or infection. This response localizes the inflammation, thus revenging its spread and promotes healing. The inflammatory response may produce localized pain, swelling, heat, redness and changes in functioning.</p></li>

<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Take a deep breath:</bold> When you feel ‘uptight’ try taking a minute to slow down and breathe deeply. Breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth. Try to inhale enough so that your lower abdomen rises and falls. Count as you exhale slowly.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Practice specific relaxation techniques:</bold> Relaxation techniques are extremely valuable tools in stress management. Most of the techniques, such as meditation, self-hypnosis, and deep muscle relaxation work in a similar fashion. In this state both the body and the mind are at rest and the outside world is screened out for a time period. The practice of one of these techniques on a regular basis can provide a wonderfully calming and relaxing feeling that seems to have a lasting effect for many people.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Manage time:</bold> One of the greatest sources of stress is poor time management. Give priority to the most important ones and do those first. If a particularly unpleasant task faces you, tackle it early in the day and get over with it; the rest of your day will include much less anxiety. Most importantly, do not overwork yourself, schedule time for both work and recreation.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Connect with others:</bold> A good way to combat sadness, boredom and loneliness is to see out activities involving others.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Talk it out:</bold> When you feel something, try to express it. Share your feelings. “Bottled Up” emotions increase frustration and stress. Talking with someone else can help clear your mind of confusion so that you can focus on problem solving. Also consider writing down thoughts and feelings. Putting problems on paper can assist you in clarifying the situation and allow you a new perspective.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Take a “Minute” vacation:</bold> Imagining a quiet country scene can take you out of the turmoil of a stressful situation. When you have the opportunity, take a moment to close your eyes and imagine a place where you feel relaxed and comfortable. Notice all the details of your chosen place, including pleasant sounds, smells and temperature or change your mental “channel” by reading a good book or playing relaxing music to create a sense of peace and tranquility.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Monitor your physical comfort:</bold> Wear comfortable clothing. If it is too hot, go somewhere where it is not. If your chair is uncomfortable, change it. If your computer screen causes eye-strain or backaches, change that, too. Do not wait until your discomfort turns into a real problem. Taking five minutes to arrange back support can save you several days of back pain.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Get physical:</bold> When you feel nervous, angry or upset, release the pressure through exercise or physical activity. Running, walking or swimming are good options for some people, while others prefer dance or martial arts. Working in the garden, washing your car, or playing with children can relieve that “uptight” feeling, relax you and often will actually energize you. Remember, your body and mind work together. Most experts recommend doing 20 minutes of aerobic activity daily will reduce stress.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Take care of your body:</bold> Healthy eating and adequate sleep fuels your mind as well as your body. Avoid consuming too much caffeine and sugar. Take time to eat breakfast in the morning, it really will help keep going through the day. Well-nourished bodies are better prepared to cope with stress, if you are irritable and tense from lack of sleep or not eating right, you will be less able to “go the distance in dealing with stressful situations”. Increase the amount of fruits and vegetables in daily diet. Take time for personal interests and hobbies. Listen to one's body.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Laugh:</bold> Maintain your sense of humor, including the ability to laugh at yourself.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Know your limits:</bold> There are many circumstances in life beyond your control, consider the fact that we live in an imperfect world. Know your limits. If a problem is beyond your control and cannot be changed at the moment, do not fight the situation. Learn to accept what is, for now, until such time when you can change things.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Think positively:</bold> Refocus the negative to be positive. Make an effort to stop negative thoughts.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Clarify:</bold> Your values and develop a sense of life meaning—Clarify your values and deciding what you really want out of your life, can help you feel better about yourself and have that sense of satisfaction and centeredness that helps you deal with the stresses of life. A sense of spirituality can help with this.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Compromise:</bold> Consider cooperation or compromise rather than confrontation. A little give and take on both sides may reduce the strain and help you feel more comfortable.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Have a good cry:</bold> A good cry during periods of stress can be a healthy way to bring relief to your anxiety, and it might prevent a headache or other physical consequences of “bottling” things up.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Avoid self medication:</bold> Alcohol and other drugs do not remove the conditions that cause stress. Although they may seem to offer temporary relief, these substances only mask or disguise problems. In the long run, alcohol use increases rather than decreases stress, by changing the way you think and solve problems and by impairing your judgment and other cognitive capacities.</p>
<p class="indent">Medications should be taken only on the advice of a doctor.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Look for the “Pieces of Gold” around you pieces of gold are positive or enjoyable moments or interactions:</bold> These may seem like small events but as these “pieces of gold” accumulate they can often provide a big lift to energy and spirits and help you begin to see things in new, more balanced way.</p></li>

<p class="noindent">Nurses take an active role in reducing stress and anxiety when they are trained in massage and deep breathing techniques they can administer to anxious patients. Nurses can also incorporate guided imagery in their work to reduce anxiety in pre- and postoperative patients.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch14lev2sec32"><h2 class="title">Assessment of the Person</h2>
<p class="noindent">Assess for the following characteristics in the individual. Such individuals are at high risk of developing stress- related disorders:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Rigid and self-punishing moral standards</p></li>
<li><p class="">High and unrealistic expectations</p></li>
<li><p class="">Too much dependence on others for love and affection and approval</p></li>
<li><p class="">Inability to master change or learn new ways of dealing with frustration</p></li>
<li><p class="">Easily prone to extreme emotional responses of fear, anxiety and depression</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Type A:</bold> personality persons</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">In addition, the presence of stressful life events, such as births, deaths, marriages, divorces, retirement, economic success or failure, etc., can predispose the person to stress-related illnesses.</p>
<p class="indent">Nurses assess these risk factors and plan care for the community, accordingly. The “I PREPARE” mnemonic can be used to guide this assessment. The “I PREPARE” mnemonic stands for:</p>
<p class="noindent">I: Investigate exposures, including potential ones</p>
<p class="noindent">P: <bold>Present employment:</bold> Does the client's current employment have risks? If so, what are these risks and how can the client reduce or eliminate these risks?</p>
<p class="noindent">R: <bold>Residence:</bold> Does the client's current residence have risks including those associated with sick house syndrome like mold?</p>
<p class="noindent">E: Environmental concerns in the client's neighborhood and local area</p>
<p class="noindent">P: Past work and leisure activities including hazardous avocations and hobbies like rock climbing and car racing</p>
<p class="noindent">R: <bold>Referrals and resources:</bold> What resources and referrals are appropriate to the client's assessed needs?</p>
<p class="noindent">E: Education checklist.</p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="ch14lev2sec35"><h2 class="title">Nursing intervention for Stress Management</h2>
<p class="noindent">Interventions are directed towards relief of acute or chronic stress. A nurse can help the person to examine the situation, identify possible solutions and accept his feelings without guilt or fear. People suffering from acute stress-related illnesses often need to change their lifestyles and ways of relating to others. The initial work of the nurse involves helping the client to recognize that change is essential, and develop clear personal objective in relation to the change. Some clients may show resistance to a necessary change. In such cases, nursing measures include:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Increasing the client's awareness as an actual or potential health problem exists.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Helping him realize that the health problem can increase if personal changes do not occur.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Identifying all possible resources (his family, friends, etc.). To support the client through the process of change, and cooperation with the treatment.</p></li>
<li><p class="">When the client becomes aware of the nature of the health problem and is told of the change needed, he often experiences a feeling of anxiety, depression and anger. The client is encouraged to talk about the losses that have resulted from the behavior change. Recognizing this grieving process provides the nurse with clear direction as to how she can help the client.<a name="page570"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">570</span></span></p></li>
<li><p class="">Family members also need accurate information about the nature of the disorder, and how they can help the client in coping with stress. The client and families also need to be informed about various alternatives such as meditation, yoga, relaxation training, etc. These techniques have a valuable role to play in helping individuals cope with stressful life events.</p></li>
<li><p class="">In all this, the nurse must always bear in mind that they are only facilitators of the change process, and the clients have the rights and responsibilities in relation to change.</p></li>

<div class="section" id="ch14lev2sec43"><h2 class="title">Levels of Adaptation</h2>
<p class="noindent">There are four levels of adaptation, namely:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p class=""><bold>Physical adaptation:</bold> By physical adaptation is meant adjustment to the physical environment. This adaptation is not voluntary because, physical conditions are inevitable and organism has to make adjustment in order to survive. Physical adaptation remains with all its compulsions.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Biological adaptation:</bold> Every organism is adapted to live in a particular environment. If they are taken out of the environment, life or even survival may be difficult. Human beings are capable of making adaptation in this area also. For example, a person adapted to hot climate will try to make adjustments even in cold climate by making adaptations.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Social adaptation:</bold> Social adaptation is the process of adjusting to sociocultural environment. Human beings are capable of not only adapting to the environment, but also making adaptations to suit his needs.</p>
<p class="indent">Every human being is continuously involved in this process of social adaptation. Social adaptation begins with a newborn has first to adapt himself to the new environment the child learns the meaning of gestures. The skill of language is slowly acquired. He learns to communicate with others around.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Environment and adaptation:</bold> The environment in which human beings live may be favorable or unfavorable. For example, fertile land, availability of water, moderate climate, presence of natural resources, etc.<a name="page573"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">573</span></span> are favorable conditions in the natural environment, whereas mountainous land, extreme climate, natural calamities, such as flood, famine and earthquake, lack of natural resources, etc. are un-favorable natural conditions. Similarly, in the social situation also, a person may find favorable or unfavorable conditions. A happy home, responsible parents, healthy neighborhood, good friends, etc., are all favorable social situations, whereas poverty, death of parents, slum dwelling/Criminal neighborhoods are unfavorable social conditions.</p></li>

<p class="noindent">Crisis can be viewed as an integral component of everyday life situations. A crisis may influence people's lives in different ways. As a consequence of a crisis experience, the individual may go down to a lower or less healthy level of functioning than what was before, the crisis, or he may resume the same level of functioning by repressing the crisis and the related emotions. On the other hand, he may function at a healthier level than prior to the crisis, because the challenge of a crisis can bring out new strengths, skills and coping mechanisms.</p>
<p class="indent">Intervention at a crisis is extremely important to prevent mental illness, because long-standing problems make the person totally incapable of handling the situation. If proper guidance is provided at the correct time, the victim will come out of it better equipped to handle future problems in life.</p>

<div class="section" id="ch14lev2sec44"><h2 class="title">Definition</h2>
<p class="noindent">Crisis is a state of disequilibrium resulting from the interaction of an event with the individual's or family's coping mechanisms, which are inadequate to meet the demands of the situation, combined with the individual's or family's perception of the meaning of the event (Taylor 1982).</p>
<p class="indent"><bold><a href="#ch14fig18" class="ulink-inter">Figure 14.18</a></bold> depicts the five signs of existential crisis.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch14lev2sec45"><h2 class="title">Crisis Response</h2>
<p class="noindent">Hendricks (1985) suggests that certain individuals are more prone to crisis than others. The following are characteristics often found in individuals who are regarded as being more susceptible to crisis:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Dissatisfaction with employment or lack of employment.</p></li>
<li><p class="">History of unresolved crisis.</p></li>
<li><p class="">History of substance abuse.<a name="page574"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">574</span></span></p></li>
<li><p class="">Poor self-esteem, unworthiness.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Superficial relationship with others.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Difficulty in coping with everyday situations.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Underutilization of resources and support systems.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Aloofness and lack of caring.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">It is important to note that individual personality traits must also be considered in conjunction with these characteristics. Crisis is defined by the individual; what is a crisis for one is merely an occurrence for another. This factor is a critical component that must be evaluated in relation to crisis prone characteristics as well as personality traits.</p>

<div class="section" id="ch14lev2sec46"><h2 class="title">Types of Crisis (<a href="#ch14fig19" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 14.19</a>)</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p class=""><bold>Maturational crisis:</bold> A maturational crisis is a stage in a person's life where adjustment and adaptation to new responsibilities and life patterns are necessary. The transition points where individuals move into successive stage often generate disequilibrium. Individuals are required to make cognitive and behavioral changes and to integrate those physical changes that accompany development. The extent to which individuals experience success in the mastery of these tasks depends on previous successes, availability of support systems, and influence of role models and acceptability of new role by others.</p>
<p class="indent">The transitional periods or events that are most commonly identified as having increased crisis potential are adolescence, marriage, parenthood, midlife and retirement.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Situational crisis:</bold> A situational crisis is one that is precipitated by an unanticipated stressful event that creates disequilibrium by threatening one's sense of biological, social or psychological integrity. Examples of events that can precipitate situational crises are premature birth, status and role changes, death of a loved one, physical or mental illness, divorce, change in geographic location and poor performance in school.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Social crisis:</bold> Social crisis is accidental, uncommon, and unanticipated and results in multiple losses and radical environmental changes. Social crises include natural disasters like floods, earthquakes, violence, nuclear accidents, mass killings, contamination of large areas by toxic wastes, wars, etc. This type of crisis is unlike maturational and situational crisis because it does not occur in the lives of all people. Because of the severity of the effects of social crisis coping strategies may not be effective. Individuals confronted with social crisis usually do not have previous experience from which to draw expertise. Support systems may be unavailable because they may also be involved in similar situations. Mental health professionals are called upon to act quickly and provide services to large numbers of people and in some cases, the whole community.</p></li>

<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Phase I:</bold> Perceived threat acts as a precipitant that generates increased anxiety. Normal coping strategies are activated, and if unsuccessful, the individual moves into Phase II.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Phase II:</bold> The ineffectiveness of the Phase I coping mechanisms leads to further disorganization. The individual experiences a sense of vulnerability. The individual may attempt to cope with the situation in a random fashion. If the anxiety continues and there is no reduction, the individual enters Phase III.</p></li>
</ul>

<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Phase III:</bold> Redefinition of the crisis is attempted and the individual is most amenable to assistance in this phase. New problem solving measures may also affect a solution. Return to precrisis level of functioning may occur. If problem solving is unsuccessful, further disorganization occurs and the individual is said to have entered Phase IV.</p></li>

<div class="section" id="ch14lev2sec49"><h2 class="title">Resolution of Crisis</h2>
<p class="noindent">There are three ways by which the individual may resolve the crisis:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p class=""><bold>Pseudo-resolution:</bold> In this, the individual uses repression and pushes out of consciousness the incident and the intense emotions associated with it, so there will not be any change in the level of functioning of the individual. But in future, if and when a crisis occurs, the repressed feelings may surface and influence the feelings aroused by the new crisis. In such a situation, the particular crisis may be more difficult to resolve because the feelings associated with the earlier crisis are neither expressed nor handled at that time.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Unsuccessful resolution:</bold> In this, the victim uses pathological adaptation at any phase of crisis, resulting in a lower level of healthy resolution of a crisis depends upon the following three factors:</p>
<p class=""><ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p class="">Realistic appraisal of the precipitating event, i.e., recognition of the relationship between the event and feelings of anxiety is necessary for effective problem-solving to occur.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Availability of support systems.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Availability of coping measures over a lifetime:</span> A person develops a repertoire of successful coping strategies that enable him to identify and resolve stressful situations functioning. The victim, rather than accepting the loss and reorganizing his life, keeps ruminating over the loss. An example is prolonged grief reaction, which results in depression.</p></li>
</ol>
</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Successful resolution:</bold> In this, the victim may go through the various phases of crisis, but reaches Phase III where various coping measures are utilized to resolve the crisis situation. The individual develops better skills and problem solving ability, which can be and will be used in various crisis situations in future.</p></li>

<p class="noindent">Crisis intervention is a technique used to help an individual or family to understand and cope with the intense feelings that are typical of a crisis. Nurses function as part of the interdisciplinary team in the use of crisis intervention as a therapeutic modality. Nurses may employ crisis techniques in their work with high-risk groups, such as clients with chronic diseases, new parents and bereaved persons. Nurses may also use crisis intervention in dealing with intragroup staff issues and client management issues. The term crisis was defined by Caplan (1964). In crisis intervention is a situation, the therapist becomes a part of the individuals life situation because the individual unable to solve problem.</p>

Knowledge of crisis intervention techniques is thus an important clinical skill of all nurses, regardless of the setting or practice specialty.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch14lev2sec66"><h2 class="title">Nursing Assessment</h2>
<p class="noindent">The first step of crisis intervention is assessment.</p>
<p class="indent">During this phase, the nurse collects data regarding the following factors:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Precipitating event or stressor.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Patient's perception of the event or stressor.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Nature and strength of the patient's support systems, coping resources.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Level of psychological stress patient is suffering from and the degree of impairment he is experiencing.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Patient's previous strengths and coping mechanisms.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">During this phase, the nurse begins to establish a positive working relationship with the patient.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch14lev2sec67"><h2 class="title">Nursing Diagnoses</h2>
<p class="noindent">The primary nursing diagnoses in crisis intervention are:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Ineffective individual coping</p></li>
<li><p class="">Ineffective family coping</p></li>
<li><p class="">Altered family process</p></li>
<li><p class="">Post-trauma response</p></li>
<li><p class="">Ineffective individual coping refers to the inability to ask for help, problem solving or meet role expectations</p></li>
<li><p class="">Ineffective family coping occurs when the family's support systems are not successful and family's economic or social well being is threatened</p></li>
<li><p class="">Altered family processes result when family members are unable to adapt to the traumatic experience constructively</p></li>
<li><p class="">Post-traumatic response is a sustained painful response to an overwhelming traumatic event.<a name="page579"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">579</span></span></p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch14lev2sec68"><h2 class="title">Planning</h2>
<p class="noindent">In planning, the previously collected data is analyzed and specific interventions are proposed.</p>
<p class="indent">During this phase, the nurse will undertake the following activities:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Dynamics underlying the present crisis are formulated</p></li>
<li><p class="">Alternative solutions to the problem are explored</p></li>
<li><p class="">Steps for achieving the solutions are identified</p></li>
<li><p class="">Environmental support needed to help the patient is decided upon, coping mechanisms that need to be developed and those which need to be strengthened are identified</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch14lev2sec69"><h2 class="title">Implementation</h2>
<p class="noindent">The following interventions are carried out to resolve crisis:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Environmental manipulation:</bold> Environmental manipulation includes interventions that directly change the patient's physical or interpersonal situation. These interventions may remove stress or provide situational support. For example a patient having difficulty in his job may take a week of sick leave so that he can be removed temporarily from that stress.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>General support:</bold> The nurse uses warmth, acceptance, empathy and reassurance to provide general support to the patient.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Generic approach:</bold> The generic approach is designed to reach high risk individuals and large groups as quickly as possible. It applies a specific method to all individuals faced with a similar type of crisis (e.g., in social disasters). Debriefing is a method of generic approach. In debriefing method, disaster victims are helped to recall events and clarify traumatic experiences. It attempts to place the traumatic event in perspective, allows the individual to relive the event in a factual way, encourages group support, and provides information on normal reaction to critical events. The goal of debriefing is to prevent the maladaptive responses that may result if the trauma is suppressed.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Individual approach:</bold> The individual approach is a type of crisis intervention similar to the diagnosis and treatment of a specific problem in a specific patient. It is particularly useful in combined situational and maturational crises and also beneficial when symptoms include homicidal and suicidal risk. The nurse must use the intervention that is most likely to help the patient develop an adaptive response to the crisis.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch14lev2sec70"><h2 class="title">Techniques of Crisis Intervention</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Catharsis:</bold> The release of feelings that takes place as the patient talks about emotionally charged areas.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Clarification:</bold> Encouraging the patient to express more clearly the relationship between certain events.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Manipulation:</bold> Using the patient's emotions, wishes or values to benefit the patient in the therapeutic process.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Reinforcement of behavior:</bold> Giving the patient positive reinforcement to adaptive behavior.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Support of defenses:</bold> Encouraging the use of healthy, adaptive defenses and discouraging those that are unhealthy or maladaptive.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Increasing self-esteem:</bold> Helping the patient to regain feelings of self worth.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Exploration of solutions:</bold> Examining alternative ways of solving the immediate problem.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent"><bold>Evaluation:</bold> The nurse and patient review the changes that have occurred. The nurse should give credit for successful changes to patients so that they realize their effectiveness and understand that what they learnt from crisis may help in coping with future crisis. If the goals have not been met, the patient and nurse can return to the first step- assessment and continue through the phases again.</p>
<p class="noindent"><bold>Modalities of crisis intervention:</bold> Community-based crisis intervention modalities have recently been developed. They are based on the philosophy that the health care team must be active and go out to the patients rather than wait for the patients to come to them. Nurses working in these modalities intervene in a variety of community settings, ranging from patients homes to street corners.</p>
<p class="noindent"><bold>Mobile crisis programs:</bold> Mobile crisis teams provide front-line interdisciplinary crisis intervention to individuals, families and communities. The nurse, who is a member of a mobile crisis team, should be able to provide on-site assessment, crisis management, treatment, referral and educational services to patients, families and the community at large. Nurses are thus able to ensure mental health care for even the most under-served populations efficiently and cost effectively.</p>
<p class="noindent"><bold>Telephone contacts:</bold> Crisis intervention is sometimes practiced by telephone rather than through face-to-face contacts. The nurse should have effective listening skills to provide crisis intervention to victims.</p>
<p class="noindent"><bold>Group work:</bold> People who have common traits on stressors will form a group. The group provides an opportunity for members to express common concerns and experiences, foster hope and build mutual support. The nurse's role in the group is active, focal and focused on the present. The nurse and the group help the patient solve the problem and reinforce new problem solving behavior.</p>
<p class="noindent"><bold>Disaster response:</bold> As part of the community, nurses are called on when an adventitious or social crisis strikes the community. Floods, earthquakes, airplane crashes, fires, nuclear accidents, etc., precipitate large number of crises. The nurse has an important role in dealing with psychosocial problems of disaster victims. The nurse participates in crisis operations and acts as a case-finder for persons suffering from psychosocial stress. It is important that nurses in the immediate post disaster period go to places where victims are likely to gather, such as hospitals, shelters, morgues.<a name="page580"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">580</span></span> During this period nurses use the generic approach of crisis intervention so that as many people as possible can receive help in a short duration of time.</p>
<p class="noindent"><bold>Victim outreach programs:</bold> Victim outreach programs use crisis intervention techniques to identify the needs of victims and then to connect them with appropriate referrals and other resources. Nurses often work in victim outreach programs, where victims are often seen immediately after the crisis. These victims need thorough evaluation, empathic support, and information and help with the large system and social networking system.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch14lev2sec71"><h2 class="title">Crisis Intervention Centers</h2>
<p class="noindent">Crisis intervention centers provide emergency psychiatric care and counseling to victims, experiencing extreme stress or conflict, often involving suicide attempts or drug or alcohol abuse. These centers, which are usually self-contained units within a hospital or community healthcare center, provide services 24 hours a day. The services may be delivered directly on the premises, or counseling may be provided over the telephone. The primary objective of crisis intervention centers is to help the person cope with immediate problem and to offer guidance and support for long-term therapy.</p>
<p class="noindent"><bold>Health education:</bold> Nurses are involved in identifying people who are at high risk for developing crisis and in teaching coping strategies to avoid the development of crisis. The public also needs education so that they can identify those needing crisis services, be aware of available services, change their attitude so that people will feel free to seek services, and obtain information about how others deal with potential crisis producing problems.</p>

</div><div class="section" id="ch14lev1sec18"><h1 class="title">GRIEF AND RESOLUTION OF GRIEF</h1>
<p class="noindent">Grief is a subjective state of emotional, physical and social response to the loss of a valued entity. The loss may be real, in which case it can be substantiated by others (e.g., death of a loved one),or perceived by the individual alone, in which case it cannot be perceived or shared by others (e.g., loss of feeling of femininity following mastectomy).</p>
<div class="figure" id="ch14fig22" data-label="Fig. 14.22"><div class="title"><span class="item-label">Fig. 14.22</span> Seven stages of grief (modified Kubler-Ross Model).</div><img alt="Fig. 14.22" src="/MediumImage/580-1.jpg"><div class="additional-markup"></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ch14lev2sec72"><h2 class="title">Stages of Grief (<a href="#ch14fig22" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 14.22</a>)</h2>
<p class="noindent">Kübler-Ross (1969) having done extensive research with terminally-ill patients identified five stages of feelings and behavior that individuals experience in response to a real, perceived or anticipated loss:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p class=""><bold>Stage I-denial:</bold> This is a stage of shock and disbelief. The response may be one of “No, it can't be true!” Denial is a protective mechanism that allows the individual to cope within an immediate time-frame while organizing more effective defense strategies.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Stage II-anger: “</bold>Why me?” and “It is not fair!” are comments often expressed during the anger stage. Anger may be directed at self or displaced on loved ones, caregivers, and even God. There may be a preoccupation with an idealized image of the lost entity.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Stage III-bargaining:</bold> “If God will help me through this, I promise I will go to church every Sunday and volunteer my time to help others”. During this stage, which is generally not visible or evident to others? a bargain is made with God in an attempt to reverse or postpone the loss.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Stage IV-depression:</bold> During this stage, the full impact of the loss is experienced. This is a time of quiet desperation and disengagement from all associations with the lost entity.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Stage V-acceptance:</bold> The final stage brings a feeling of peace regarding the loss that has occurred. Focus is on the reality of the loss and its meaning for the individuals affected by it. All individuals do not experience each of these stages in response to a loss, nor do they necessarily experience them in this order. Some individuals grieving behavior may fluctuate, and even overlap between stages.</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch14lev2sec73"><h2 class="title">Resolution of Grief</h2>
<p class="noindent">Resolution of the process of mourning is thought to have occurred when an individual can look back on the relationship with the lost entity and accept both the pleasure and the disappointments (both the positive and negative aspects) of the association. Preoccupation with the lost entity is replaced with energy and desire to pursue new situations and relationships. The length of the grief process may be prolonged by a number of factors—if the relationship with the lost entity had been marked by ambivalence, reaction to the loss may be burdened with guilt, which lengthens the grief reaction.<a name="page581"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">581</span></span></p>

<p class="indent"><bold><a href="#ch14tbl8" class="ulink-inter">Table 14.8</a></bold> depicts the comparison of grief resolution theories.</p>
<p class="indent">In anticipatory grief where a loss is anticipated, individuals often begin the work of grieving before the actual loss occurs. Most people experience the grieving behavior once the actual loss occurs, but having this time to prepare for the loss can facilitate the process of mourning, actually decreasing the length and intensity of the response. The number of recent losses experienced by an individual also affects the length of the grieving process and whether he is able to complete one grieving process before another loss occurs.</p>
</div>
</div><div class="section" id="ch14lev1sec19"><h1 class="title">MALADAPTIVE GRIEF RESPONSES</h1>
<p class="noindent">Maladaptive grief responses to loss occur when an individual is not able to satisfactorily progress through the stages of grieving to achieve resolution. Several types to grief responses have been identified as pathological These are prolonged, delayed/inhibited, and distorted responses.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch14lev2sec74"><h2 class="title">Prolonged Response</h2>
<p class="noindent">It is characterized by an intense preoccupation with memories of the lost entity for many years after the loss has occurred.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch14lev2sec75"><h2 class="title">Delayed or Inhibited Response</h2>
<p class="noindent">The individual becomes fixed in the denial stage of the grieving process. The emotional pain associated with loss is not experienced, but there may be evidence of anxiety disorders or sleeping disorders. The individual may remain in denial for many years until the grief response is triggered by a reminder of the loss or even by another unrelated loss.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch14lev2sec76"><h2 class="title">Distorted Response</h2>
<p class="noindent">The individual who experiences a distorted response is fixed in the anger stage of grieving. The normal behaviors associated with grieving, such as helplessness, hopelessness, sadness, anger and guilt are exaggerated out of proportion to the situation. The individual turns the anger inward on the self and is unable to function in normal activities of daily living. Pathological depression is a distorted grief response.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch14lev2sec77"><h2 class="title">Treatment</h2>
<p class="noindent">Normal grief does not require any treatment while complicated grief requires medication depending on the prevailing behavior responses.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch14lev2sec78"><h2 class="title">Nursing Intervention</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Provide an open accepting environment.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Encourage ventilation of feelings and listen actively.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Provide various diversional activities.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Provide teaching about common symptoms of grief.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Reinforce goal-directed activities.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Bring together similar aggrieved persons, to encourage communication, share experiences of the loss and to offer companionship, social and emotional support.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div><div class="section" id="ch14lev1sec20"><h1 class="title">RECREATION AND DIVERSIONAL THERAPIES</h1>
<p class="noindent">Recreation is an activity of leisure, leisure being discretionary time. The “need to do something for recreation” is an essential element of human biology and psychology. Recreational activities are often done for enjoyment, amusement, or pleasure and are considered to be “fun”.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch14lev2sec79"><h2 class="title">Indoor Recreational Options</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Reading:</bold> The benefits of reading cannot be stressed enough. I feel that people who love reading, can never get bored when they are alone. Reading is not only a great source of entertainment, but also a vast source of knowledge and inspiration. Reading can be one of the best activities you can enjoy indoors.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Writing:</bold> What better way to spend a lazy afternoon, then pour heart and allow creative juices to flow with a pen and a paper! Well, writing cannot just be fun, but it can be great stress buster as well.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Internet surfing:</bold> Well, if there is nothing else to do, you can always log on to the Internet. The Internet provides you an endless number of options for recreation, which include online games, online shopping, online chatting, video surfing, blogging, social networking, online dating or even reading the online news.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Dance:</bold> Dancing is not just an art, it also a great exercise and hence an effective stress buster! Although, it is always an added advantage if you take formal training in this art, it certainly is not a prerequisite! Anyone and I mean, absolutely anyone can dance.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Music:</bold> Just like dance, music is just as leisurely—you do not have to be a great singer or a musician to enjoy music. I listen to music while I am driving to and from work, and I cannot tell you the number of times I just start singing while listening to these songs.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Indoor games:</bold> A game of snooker, pool, table tennis, indoor tennis, badminton, racquetball or squash can be a great way to spend your time indoors and enjoy yourself!</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch14lev2sec80"><h2 class="title">Outdoor Recreational Options</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Hiking:</bold> If it is a crisp sunny day with fresh fragrant winds, then what better thing to do than to go hiking in the lap of nature? Load your backpack and go hiking, either with a bunch of friends or by yourself! Hiking is a wonderful experience that will help you forget your stress and get rid of all your negativity.<a name="page582"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">582</span></span></p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Camping:</bold> Well, have a great camping place nearby? How about going camping? Enjoy nature's bounty as you camp at a verdant camping site, light up a fire and sit around with a sumptuous barbecue meal and refreshing drinks!</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Fishing:</bold> Fishing is a favorite recreational sport for many ardent fishing lovers and yes, before all the animal right issues start coming into the picture, let me tell you that most of the fishing lovers allow their catch to go back to the water bodies once trapped in the nets. There are various types of fishing, such as trout fishing, sport fishing, bass fishing, fly fishing or even ice fishing.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Sailing:</bold> Imagine a pleasant day at a lake nearby, your boat gliding over the azure waters as you stand against the humid breeze and feel the wind in your hair. Sounds wonderful does not it? Well, sailing is exciting, and no matter with whom you want to go sailing; this can be a fun experience. Make it a lively family picnic at the sea on a bright sunny day or a quiet rendezvous with your lover in the evening, while you watch the orange-red sun melt in the waters. In addition to this, you can also pick out other activities like boating, kayaking or rafting.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Scuba diving:</bold> Well, if you have always been a water lover, and would love to experience the flora and fauna of the deep waters, then scuba diving might be your thing! For beginners, it is advised to have a professional instructor with you. It is truly exhilarating to watch the beautiful shoals of fish pass right by your side or even grab bits of fish food from your hands! For adventure lovers, this is one must do activity!</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Skateboarding:</bold> Who said only kids should try skateboarding? But having said that I must add that no matter how old you are, you need to be physically fit to try out such sports! Skateboarding might be a fun way to spend time and enjoy the beauty of your lovely neighborhood or even meet your friends around the corner!</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Skydiving:</bold> Having recently tried skydiving I can vouch for the fact that this is one adventure sport that you do not wanna miss! The excitement of the free-fall and the heavenly experience of the view that you enjoy during the parachute ride after the free fall, are truly blissful! The initial jump from about 12,000 feet is enough to give you the adventurous rush or kick that adventure-sports enthusiasts always talk about!</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Skiing:</bold> Skiing or Snow Skiing is a collective term used for a number of sports that make use of skis as the primary equipment. There are several styles of skiing, some of which include Nordic skiing, Alpine skiing and Telemark skiing. If you are planning to visit the snowy mountains or are fortunate to have them close by, then skiing is something you must definitely try out. Another snow sport which is an amalgamation of skating and skiing is snowboarding.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Swimming:</bold> Swimming is also a favorite activity amongst water lovers. Swimming is an excellent way to relax yourself as well as a fun workout to keep you healthy. For people who just hate exercising in the gym, regular swimming might be a great way to stay in shape.</p></li>
