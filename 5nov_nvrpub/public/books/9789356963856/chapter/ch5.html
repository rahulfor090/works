</div><div class="section" id="ch5lev1sec2"><h1 class="title">URINARY ELIMINATION</h1>
<p class="noindent">Urinary elimination, a natural process in which the body excretes waste products and materials those exceeded bodily needs, usually is taken for granted. When the urinary system fails to function properly, virtually organ systems can be affected. Persons with alterations in urinary elimination may also suffer emotionally from body image changes. The proper functioning of the urinary system is vital to the body's physical well-being to life itself and a person's general sense of well-being. Nursing therapies promote or minimize factors that influence urinary elimination. Each client has a different pattern of elimination. The nurse must assess this pattern and design therapies to promote normal urinary elimination when necessary. The nurse uses devices, such as a condom or an indwelling catheter to assist the client with urinary elimination. The nurse assisting a client with urination or intervening to resolve health problems related to urinary needs may have specialized abilities.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch5lev2sec1"><h2 class="title">Concept of Elimination</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Elimination is a basic human function of excreting waste through the bowel and urinary system. The process of elimination depends on many variables and intricate processes that occur within the body.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Many medical conditions and surgeries can adversely affect the processes of elimination, so nurses must facilitate their patients’ bowel and urinary elimination as needed.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Common nursing interventions related to facilitating elimination include inserting and managing urinary catheters, obtaining urine specimens, caring for ostomies, providing patient education to promote healthy elimination, and preventing complications.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The elimination of waste from the bowel and bladder is an essential body function.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The major nursing responsibilities associated with bowel and bladder elimination include assessing the bowel and bladder functions, promoting normal bowel and bladder health and, management of altered bowel and bladder functions.<a name="page174"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">174</span></span></p></li>

<div class="section" id="ch5lev2sec2"><h2 class="title">Definition</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Urinary elimination is defined as expulsion of waste products from the body through the urinary system</p></li>
<li><p class="">Elimination from the urinary tract helps to remove the waste products from body. It is essential to the body's physical well being.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch5lev2sec3"><h2 class="title">Physiology of Urine Elimination</h2>
<p class="noindent">Urinary elimination depends on the function of the kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra. Kidneys remove waste from the blood to form urine. Ureters transport urine from the kidneys to the bladder. The bladder holds urine until the urge. It influences urination. Usually, infants or children with 6 to 8 kg excrete 400 to 500 mL per day and child cannot withhold urination. The adult normally voids 1500 to 1600 mL per day, has a normal urine color and; also has control over urination. Aging impairs urination, e.g., elder adults. Food and fluid foods, high in water content, increase urine production. Certain foods affect the color and odor of urine. Certain fluid needed to urinate develops. Urine leaves the body through the urethra. The structure of nephron is illustrated in <bold><a href="#ch5fig1" class="ulink-inter">Figure 5.1</a>.</bold></p>
<p class="indent">All organs of the urinary system must be intact and functional for successful removal of urinary wastes. The process of emptying the bladder is known as micturition or voiding or urination. The bladder normally holds as much as 600 mL of urine. However, the desire to urinate can be sensed when the bladder contains only a small amount of urine (150 to 200 mL in adults and 50 to 200 mL in a child). As the volume increases, the bladder walls stretch, sending sensory impulses to micturition center in the sacral spinal cord. Parasympathetic impulses from the micturition center stimulate the detrusor muscle to contract rhythmically. The internal sphincter also relaxes so that urine may enter the urethra, although voiding does not yet occur. As the bladder contracts, nerve impulses travel up the spinal cord to the midbrain and cerebral cortex. A person is thus conscious of the need to urinate. If the person chooses not to void, the external urinary sphincter remains contracted, and the micturition reflex is inhibited. However, when a person is ready to void, the external sphincter relaxes, the micturition reflex stimulates the detrusor muscle to contract and urination occurs. The act of micturition normally is painless.</p>

<div class="section" id="ch5lev2sec6"><h2 class="title">Factors Affecting Urinary Elimination (<a href="#ch5fig2" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 5.2</a>)</h2>
<p class="noindent">There are numerous factors which affect the amount and quality of urine produced by the body and manner which it is excreted. These are as follows—when person is dehydrated to maintain fluids and electrolyte balance. According to lifestyle, some sociocultural variables influence a person's normal voiding habits.</p>
<p class="indent">Developmental considerations are concerned; infants are born without voluntary control of urination and with little ability to concentrate urine. Older children and adults have general control of urination voluntarily. Physiological may affect urination.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Lifestyle:</bold> Many individuals’ families and sociocultural variables influence a person's normal voiding habits. For some individuals voiding is a very personal and private act.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Fluid and food intake:</bold> The healthy body maintains a sensitive balance between the amount of fluid ingested and the amount of fluid eliminated. When fluid intake increases, the output also increases.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Environment:</bold> During summer, due to excessive perspiration urine output is less. During winter, due to lack of perspiration, urine output is more.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Psychological factors:</bold> Stress can also interfere with the ability to relax external urethral sphincter as a result, emptying the bladder completely becomes difficult or impossible.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Muscle tone and activity:</bold> People who exercise regularly will have good muscle tone increased body metabolism and good urine production.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Pathological conditions:</bold> Endocrine disorders, such as diabetes insipidus increase urine formation. Diseases of the kidney themselves can reduce kidney function and perhaps eventually result in renal failure.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Surgical and diagnostic procedure:</bold> Surgery on structures adjacent to the urinary tract can also affect voiding because of swelling in the lower abdomen and often necessitates the use of retention catheter for a short time.</p>
<p class="indent">Privacy and adequate time to urinate are usually important for most people; they think voiding is private act. The nurse approach in or to a client's elimination must consider cultural and social habits. Psychologic variables, such as anxiety and stress do not change the characteristics of urine but may cause a sense of urgency and increase frequency of urination.<a name="page176"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">176</span></span></p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Activity and muscle tone</bold> due to regular exercise increases the metabolism and helps in optimal urine production and elimination. Weak abdominal and pelvic floor muscles impair bladder contraction and control of external urethral sphincter. In pathologic condition, several diseases can affect the ability to micturate. Any lesion of peripheral nerves leading to the bladder causes loss of bladder tone, reduced sensation of bladder-fullness and difficulty in controlling urination (e.g., diabetes mellitus).</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Medications</bold> have numerous effects on urine production and elimination. Diuretics prevent reabsorption of water and certain electrolytes to increase urine output. Urinary retention may be caused by use of anticholinergics, antihistamines, antihypertensive and beta-adrenergic blockers. Certain drugs also change the color of urine. For example, diuretics lead to pale yellow, B complex preparations lead to green or blue-green. Iron tablets lead to brown or black color urine.</p></li>

<p class="noindent">Urinary retention is the inability to empty the bladder. Urinary retention can be acute or chronic. Acute urinary retention is a medical emergency. Urinary retention is most common in men in their 50s and 60s because of prostate enlargement. A woman may experience urinary retention if her bladder sags or moves out of the normal position (cystocele) or pulled out of position by a sagging of the lower part of the colon (rectocele).</p>

<div class="section" id="ch5lev3sec4"><h3 class="title">Urinary Incontinence</h3>
<p class="noindent">Urinary incontinence is the involuntary loss of urine. Although abnormal, it is a common symptom that can seriously affect the physical, psychological, and social well-being of affected individuals of all ages. It has been estimated that 1 in 5 women develop urinary incontinence, but many are too embarrassed to discuss the condition with their healthcare providers. Some believe it is a normal part of aging that they have to live with. The result can be isolation and depression when they limit their activities and social interactions because of embarrassment due to incontinence. Nurses can greatly improve the quality of life for these patients by assessing for incontinence in a sensitive manner and then providing patient education about methods to prevent and/or manage incontinence.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch5lev4sec11"><h4 class="title">Definition</h4>
<p class="noindent">Urinary incontinence is unintentional or uncontrolled urine leakage that occurs due to poor functioning of muscles called urinary sphincter which enable to hold urine in the urinary bladder. It is more common in women than in men.<a name="page179"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">179</span></span></p>
<div class="figure" id="ch5fig5" data-label="Fig. 5.5"><div class="title"><span class="item-label">Fig. 5.5</span> Some common types of incontinence.</div><img alt="Fig. 5.5" src="/MediumImage/179-1.jpg"><div class="additional-markup"></div></div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch5lev4sec12"><h4 class="title">Types of Incontinence (<a href="#ch5fig5" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 5.5</a>)</h4>
<p class="noindent">There are different types of urinary incontinence:</p>
<p class="indent">Continence is achieved through an interplay of the physiology of the bladder, urethra, sphincter, pelvic floor, and the nervous system coordinating these organs. A disruption in any of these areas can cause several types of urinary incontinence.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p class=""><bold>Stress urinary incontinence</bold> is the involuntary loss of urine with intra-abdominal pressure (e.g., laughing and coughing) or physical exertion (e.g., jumping). It is caused by weak pelvic floor muscles that is often the result of pregnancy and vaginal delivery, menopause, and vaginal hysterectomy.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Urge urinary incontinence</bold> (also referred to as “overactive bladder”) is urine leakage caused by the sensation of a strong desire to void (urgency). It can be caused by increased sensitivity to stimulation by the detrusor muscle in the bladder or decreased inhibitory control of the central nervous system.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Mixed urinary incontinence</bold> is a mix of urinary frequency, urgency, and stress incontinence.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Overflow incontinence</bold> occurs when small amounts of urine leak from a bladder that is always full. This condition tends to occur in males with enlarged prostates that prevent the complete emptying of the bladder.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Functional incontinence</bold> occurs in older adults who have normal bladder control but have a problem getting to the toilet because of arthritis or other disorders that make it hard to move quickly or manipulate zippers or buttons. Patients with dementia also have increased risk for functional incontinence.</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch5lev4sec13"><h4 class="title">Causes</h4>
<p class="noindent">Incontinence mainly occurs when the pressure due to a completely filled bladder exceeds a certain threshold. Here are some factors that can increase this pressure and cause incontinence.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Over-active bladder</p></li>
<li><p class="">Blockage in the urinary system</p></li>
<li><p class="">Mental health problems</p></li>
<li><p class="">Poor muscle control</p></li>
<li><p class="">Medications</p></li>
<li><p class="">Prostate problems</p></li>
<li><p class="">Excess urine production</p></li>
<li><p class="">Secondary causes due to underlying medical condition</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch5lev4sec14"><h4 class="title">Assessment of Incontinence</h4>
<p class="noindent">Assessment begins with screening questions during a health history, including questions, such as, “Do you have any problems with the leakage or dribbling of urine? Do you ever have problems making it to the bathroom in time?” If a patient responds “Yes” to either of these questions, it is helpful to encourage them to start a voiding diary to record their urination habits and activities. The voiding diary should include the following:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">When and how much the patient urinates</p></li>
<li><p class="">Urinary leakage and what the patient was doing when it happened (for example, running, biking, laughing)</p></li>
<li><p class="">Sudden urges to urinate</p></li>
<li><p class="">How often the patient wakes at night to use the bathroom</p></li>
<li><p class="">Type and volume of food and beverages and the time of intake</p></li>
<li><p class="">Medication use, such as diuretics, and the timing of administration</p></li>
<li><p class="">Any pain or problems experienced before, during, and after urinating (for example, sudden urges, difficulty urinating, dribbling urine, feeling as if the bladder is never empty, weak urine flow). <bold><a href="#ch5tbl2" class="ulink-inter">Table 5.2</a></bold> shows the severity of urinary incontinence.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch5lev4sec15"><h4 class="title">Treatment</h4>
<p class="noindent">Most cases of urinary incontinence can be treated with lifestyle changes and bladder training exercise but medication and other coping strategies, such as use of diapers (that can soak the excess urine) are also used if the problem is due to urgency or mixed incontinence.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">

</div><div class="section" id="ch5lev1sec3"><h1 class="title">MONITORING URINARY OUTPUT</h1>
<p class="noindent">Normal urinary output is approximately 1.5 liters in 24 hours and the usual frequency of micturition is between 5 and 10 times in that period. However, this can be influenced significantly by the amount of fluid a person drinks and how much fluid they are losing through sweating, mental state and lifestyle.</p>
<p class="indent">Urine normally consists of—96% water, 2% urea, 2% uric acid, creatinine, sodium, potassium, chlorides, phosphates, sulfates, oxalates. These are all waste products of the body's utilization of food and fluid.</p>
<p class="indent">The intensity of color of normal urine depends on the concentration, and usually ranges from yellow to amber. Fresh urine does not have a strong odor and it should be clear when voided.</p>
<p class="indent">When monitoring a client's urine, important clues can be gained simply by careful observation. For example, greenish or yellow-brown urine could contain bile pigments and may indicate problems with liver function, whilst blood and hemoglobin will give a red-brown color if present in quite large quantities. Some drugs, foods and dyes may also change the color of urine. If any abnormalities are found, they should be documented, reported and further investigations undertaken in consultation with the medical staff. If you suspect that blood is present in the urine, and if the client is female, check whether or not they are menstruating before reporting, as menstrual blood can give a false positive result.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch5lev2sec8"><h2 class="title">Urine Output Monitoring (<a href="#ch5fig6" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 5.6</a>)</h2>
<p class="noindent">Urine output is the best indicator of the state of the patient's kidneys. When the kidneys are producing an adequate amount of urine it means that they are well perfused and oxygenated.<a name="page181"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">181</span></span> Otherwise, it indicates that the patient is suffering from some pathology. UO is used in multiple therapeutic protocols to assess how the patient reacts to treatment, such as the resuscitation of septic shock patients and the resuscitation and early management of burn patient urine output (UO) is a vital sign for critically ill patients, but standards for monitoring and reporting vary widely between ICUs. Careful monitoring of UO could lead to earlier recognition of acute kidney injury (AKI) and better fluid management. The investigators sought to determine If the intensity of UO monitoring is associated with outcomes in patients with and those without AKI. The normal range of urine output is 800 to 2,000 milliliters per day if you have a normal fluid intake of about 2 liters per day.</p>

<p class="noindent">Urinary retention can be acute or chronic. The causes of urinary retention can be:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Obstructive:</bold> Urinary obstruction can be intrinsic (within the urinary system) or extrinsic. Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), stones, strictures, stenosis, or a tumor can cause intrinsic obstruction. BPH is the most common cause of urinary retention. If the blockage is from pathology outside the bladder, it is classified as extrinsic. An enlarged abdominal or pelvic organ can compress on the bladder neck resulting in extrinsic obstruction.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Infectious and inflammatory:</bold> Cystitis, arthritis, prostatitis (common infectious etiology in men), and vulvovaginitis in the woman can cause urinary retention.</p></li>

<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Urinary tract infection (UTI) is the most common complication that occurs as a result of long-term catheterization. The normal urinary flow prevents the ascension of microbes from the periurethral skin avoiding the infection. Alteration of the defensive mechanism from the catheter results in an increased risk of UTIs. <span class="italic">Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae</span> are the most common organisms implicated in UTIs. Recurrent UTIs are associated with increased antibiotic resistance.</p></li>
<li><p class="">A chronic bladder infection can occur from urinary (10–100 mL) stasis at the base of the bladder, which is obstructed by the balloon of the catheter.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Pain due to traction on the drainage bag.</p></li>

<li><p class="">Paraphimosis</p></li>
<li><p class="">Urethral injury</p></li>
<li><p class="">Catheter obstruction can occur due to the sediment buildup in patients with subclinical bacteriuria. Flushing can often relieve the blockage. If unsuccessful catheter replacement may be required.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Urine leakage from the urethral meatus extrinsic to the catheter may occur as a result of bladder spasms. These spasms can be painful and can be alleviated with anticholinergic medications, such as oxybutynin.</p></li>

<p class="noindent">Continuous bladder irrigation is a procedure usually required for two common reasons. One is that it is done in order to decrease the chances of the formation of blood clots in the bladder right after certain kinds of surgery. Second is to administer medication into the bladder in order to ward off an infection or may be for other reasons. At times, there is a need for constant monitoring, to be certain that no complications may happen.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch5lev2sec40"><h2 class="title">Definition</h2>
<p class="noindent">Continuous bladder irrigation is an ongoing infusion of a sterile solution into the bladder, generally by utilizing a three-way irrigation closed system that has a triple-lumen catheter.

<li><p class=""><bold>Make sure that the patient has a three-way urinary catheter otherwise, a three-way catheter has to be inserted:</bold> A three-way catheter is needed to allow for different fluids to pass through the set.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Place the irrigation flasks on the IV pole and prime irrigation set, upholding asepsis of the irrigation set:</bold> To prevent infection and other complications. See to it that only one of the irrigation flask clamps have been opened when priming the irrigation set or else the fluid can run from one flask to another. After the irrigation set has been primed, make sure that every clamp on the irrigation set is closed.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Put on goggles and impermeable gown, place underpad beneath the catheter connection:</bold> In order to maintain sterility and keep from contamination.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Wash hands and put on non-sterile gloves:</bold> To decrease the risk of spreading bacteria and contamination.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Swab the IDC irrigation as well as catheter ports with chlorhexidine swabs and let dry:</bold> To prevent contamination.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Remove the valve from the irrigation lumen of the catheter with the use of sterile gauze and discard valve:</bold> To initiate irrigation.<a name="page188"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">188</span></span></p></li>

Consequently if specimens cannot be transported to the laboratory and examined within two hours of collection they must be stored in an appropriate refrigeration unit at 40°C. However, they should not be stored for longer than 24 hours otherwise any findings will be inaccurate.</p>
<p class="indent">Assessment of the client's physical and mental capacity prior to collecting a specimen of urine is essential in order to ensure that they can comply with the needs of the procedure, particularly if a mid-stream specimen (MSU) <bold>(<a href="#ch5fig21" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 5.21</a>)</bold> or a 24-hour collection is required. For an MSU, the client must urinate in the toilet or other receptacle, stop, pass urine into the specimen container or sterile receptacle, stop and then finish urinating as normal. If you wish to collect all the urine that the client passes in a 24-hour period (24-hour urine collection), special bottles containing preservatives and other chemicals are usually obtainable from the laboratory.</p>

<p class="noindent">The nursing role in relation to the assessment and management of urinary retention, urinary incontinence and catheterization are considered using recent literature and best practice statements. Retention of urine and incontinence has a major detrimental impact on a person's life and nurses have an important role to play in supporting patients. Catheterization is often necessary for acute retention of urine but is the last resort for incontinence. However, when catheter use is appropriate, asepsis technique during insertion and continuing management can help to minimize associated problems. Urinary elimination problems are embarrassing and distressing and nurses need to deal with them with sensitivity and empathy.</p>
<p class="indent">The role and responsibilities of nurse, when managing the urinary elimination in his/her clients include the following:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Taking nursing history pertaining to client with partial emphasis on urinary elimination</p></li>
<li><p class="">Conducting or assessing physical assessment of kidneys, bladder, urethral orifice, skin integrity and hydration and urine</p></li>
<li><p class="">In addition, carrying out the following assessment measures, such as measuring urine output, collecting urine specimens, determining the presence of abnormal constituents, assisting with diagnostic procedure.<a name="page198"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">198</span></span></p></li>

</div><div class="section" id="ch5lev1sec14"><h1 class="title">BOWEL ELIMINATION</h1>
<p class="noindent">Defecation is the expulsion of feces from the anus and the rectum. It is also called a bowel movement.</p>
<p class="indent">The peristaltic waves move the feces into the sigmoid colon and the rectum, the sensory nerves in the rectum are stimulated and the individual becomes aware of the need to defecate.</p>
<p class="indent"><bold><a href="#ch5fig26" class="ulink-inter">Figure 5.26</a></bold> shows manual evacuation of bowel.</p>
</div><div class="section" id="ch5lev1sec15"><h1 class="title">PHYSIOLOGY OF BOWEL ELIMINATION</h1>
<p class="noindent">Defecation is the term given for the act of expelling feces from the digestive tract via the anus <bold>(<a href="#ch5fig27" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 5.27</a>)</bold>. It is a complex function that requires coordinated involvement from the gastrointestinal system, the nervous system, as well as the musculoskeletal system. The frequency of defecation within a 24-hour period varies depending on age and diet, but most people tend to have a bowel movement 1 to 3 times daily.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Colonic mass movements and peristalsis move intestinal contents distally into the rectum. Rectal filling activates mechanoreceptors in the rectal wall causing awareness of the need to defecate.</p></li>
<li><p class="">As stool reaches the rectum, a small amount is allowed to pass through to the anal canal by an involuntary relaxation of the internal anal sphincter. This action, known as the recto-anal inhibitory reflex, is necessary for anal sampling, which is the process of determining if the rectal contents are of the gaseous, solid, or liquid form.</p></li>
<li><p class="">At this time, if defecation is not socially acceptable or convenient, the rectal wall relaxes, and the need to defecate subsides temporarily. If it is a proper time to defecate, the person generally either sits or squats depending on their environment.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Next, contraction of the abdominal muscles and performing the Valsalva maneuver while simultaneously relaxing the external anal sphincter and puborectalis muscle will expel feces from the body due to the pressure gradient generated between the rectum and anal canal.</p></li>
<li><p class="">After fecal expulsion, the closing reflex occurs, which involves the external anal sphincter regaining its tone to maintain continence at rest.</p></li>

<div class="section" id="ch5lev2sec83"><h2 class="title">Composition of Feces (<a href="#ch5fig28" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 5.28</a>)</h2>
<p class="noindent">Normally, feces are made up of 75% water and 25% solid matter. About 30% of the solid matter consists of dead bacteria; about 30% consists of indigestible food matter such as cellulose; 10 to 20% is cholesterol and other fats; 10 to 20% is inorganic substances such as calcium phosphate and iron phosphate; and 2 to 3% is protein. Cell debris shed from the mucous membrane of the intestinal tract also passes in the waste material, as do bile pigments (bilirubin) and dead leukocytes (white blood cells). The brown color of faeces is due to the action of bacteria on bilirubin, which is the end product of the breakdown of hemoglobin (red blood cells). The odour of feces is caused by the chemicals indole, skatole, hydrogen sulfide, and mercaptans, which are produced by bacterial action.</p>

<div class="section" id="ch5lev2sec85"><h2 class="title">Defecation Reflex</h2>
<p class="noindent">There are two centers governing the reflex to defecate. One is situated in the medulla and subsidiary one is in the spinal cord. When parasympathetic stimulation occurs, the internal anal sphincter relaxes and the colon contracts. The defecation reflex is stimulated chiefly by the fecal mass in the rectum. When the rectum is distended the intrarectal pressure rises, the defecation reflex is stimulated by the muscle stretch, and the desire to eliminate results.</p>

<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Age and development:</bold> There is a marked difference between the stools of an infant and an older person. The very young are unable to control elimination until the neuromuscular system is developed, usually between the ages of 2 to 3 years.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Daily patterns:</bold> Most people have regular patterns of bowel elimination which include frequency, timing considerations, position and place changes in any of these may upset a person routine and actually lead to constipation.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Lifestyles:</bold> Many individual's family and sociocultural variables influences a person's usual elimination habits. The long-term effect of bowel training, the availability of toilet facilities, embarrassment about a odors and need to privacy, also affect the fecal elimination patterns.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Fluids:</bold> Both the type and amount of fluid ingested affect elimination. Healthy fecal elimination is facilitated by a daily intake of 2000 to 3000 mL.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Activity and muscle tone:</bold> Regular exercise improves gastrointestinal motility and muscle tone while inactivity decreases both. Adequate tone in the abdominal muscles, the diaphragm and the perineal muscles is essential to case in defecation.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Psychological factors:</bold> Emotional stress affects the body in many ways. Persons with anxiety causes increased intestinal motility and persons with depression causes slower intestinal motility resulting in constipation.<a name="page200"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">200</span></span></p></li>

<li><p class=""><bold>Medications:</bold> Narcotic analgesics cause constipation by decreased gastrointestinal mobility. Many medications have diarrhea as undesirable side effect.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Diagnostic procedure:</bold> Barium salts used in radiologic examinations. It hardens, if allowed to remain in the colon, producing constipation and sometimes an impaction.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Surgery and anesthesia:</bold> Direct manipulation of the bowel during abdominal surgery inhibits peristalsis causing a condition termed as paralytic lieu's. General anesthetic agents that are inhaled also inhibit peristalsis by blocking the parasympathetic impulses to the intestinal muscle.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Irritants:</bold> Spicy, foods, bacterial toxins and poisons can irritate the intestinal tract and produce diarrhea and often large amounts of flatus.</p></li>

<div class="section" id="ch5lev3sec30"><h3 class="title">Constipation</h3>
<p class="noindent">Constipation means hard stools, difficulty passing stools (straining), or a sense of incomplete emptying after a bowel movement. The cause of each of these symptoms of constipation varies, so the approach to each should be tailored to each specific person. The number of bowel movements generally decreases with age. Most adults have bowel movements between three and 21 times per week, and this would be considered normal. The most common pattern is one bowel movement a day, but this pattern is seen in less than half the people. Moreover, most people are irregular and do not have bowel movements every day or the same number of bowel movements each day.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch5lev4sec19"><h4 class="title">Definition</h4>
<p class="noindent">Constipation occurs when stool moves through the large intestine too slowly or remains in the large intestine for too long. Constipation is referred to the person's normal defecation pattern and involves a change in stool consistency (harder and drier than usual) and a change in defecation frequency (less than usual).</p>

<div class="section" id="ch5lev4sec23"><h4 class="title">Prevention and Management of Constipation</h4>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Health teaching:</bold> Any person suffering from constipation must understand the physiology of defecation and the factors affecting the defecation.</p></li>

<li><p class=""><bold>Adequate intake of roughage in diet:</bold> Foods containing high fibrous content should be included in the diet, such as raw and cooked vegetables, raw and cooked fruits, whole grain cereals etc. The quantity and quality of breakfast is more important to prevent constipation. One purpose of the breakfast is to produce a vigorous gastrocolic reflex and expulsion of the fecal matter.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Establishing a habit pattern:</bold> Usually the defecation reflex is found immediately after a full breakfast. So the person should find time to sit on the toilet immediately after the breakfast.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Relaxation:</bold> Have an environment conductive to relaxation because tension, anger, worry, hurry, fear, etc., interfere with the defecation reflex. Reassure the nervous client. <bold>Privacy:</bold> A squatting position is most effective posture during defecation because the individual can increase intra-abdominal pressure, necessary for expelling the feces.

<div class="section" id="ch5lev3sec31"><h3 class="title">Diarrhea (<a href="#ch5fig33" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 5.33</a>)</h3>
<p class="noindent">Diarrhea is loose, watery stools. Having diarrhea means passing loose stools three or more times a day. Acute diarrhea is a common problem that usually lasts 1 or 2 days and goes away on its own. Diarrhea lasting more than 2 days may be a sign of a more serious problem. Chronic diarrhea—diarrhea that lasts at least 4 weeks—may be a symptom of a chronic disease. Chronic diarrhea symptoms may be continual or they may come and go. Diarrhea of any duration may cause dehydration, which means the body lacks enough fluid and electrolytes-chemicals in salts, including sodium, potassium, and chloride—to function properly. Loose stools contain more fluid and electrolytes and weigh more than solid stools.</p>

<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Diarrhea is manifested by frequent evacuation of watery stools. Due to increased gastrointestinal motility, there is rapid passage of fecal contents through the lower gastrointestinal tract.</p></li>
<li><p class="">This reduces the time available for the large intestine to reabsorb water and electrolytes.</p></li>
<li><p class="">It is the consistency of the stool (less formed and more watery) that is more definitive of diarrhea than the increased frequency of defecation. Along with the high water content, diarrheal stools also may contain mucus which contributes to increased volume.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The extra volume and rapidity with which it reaches the rectum causes rectal distension, resulting in intense urge to defecate. Color of the stool can vary from light brown to yellow to green.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Besides the intense urge to defecate, there may be abdominal cramps, nausea and painful burning sensations at the anus.</p></li>
<li><p class="">As the diarrheal stools are acidic, frequent passage of this acidic stool can cause anal soreness and inflammation of the skin around the anus, leading to bleeding and breakdown of the perineal tissue.</p></li>

<p class="noindent">Acute diarrhea is usually caused by a bacterial, viral, or parasitic infection. Chronic diarrhea is usually related to a functional disorder, such as irritable bowel syndrome or an intestinal disease, such as Crohn's disease. The most common causes of diarrhea include the following:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Bacterial infections:</bold> Several types of bacteria consumed through contaminated food or water can cause diarrhea. Common culprits include <span class="italic">Campylobacter, Salmonella, Shigella, and Escherichia coli (E. coli).</span></p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Viral infections:</bold> Many viruses cause diarrhea, including rotavirus, norovirus, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, and viral hepatitis. Infection with the rotavirus is the most common cause of acute diarrhea in children. Rotavirus diarrhea usually resolves in 3 to 7 days but can cause problems digesting lactose for up to a month or longer.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Parasites:</bold> Parasites can enter the body through food or water and settle in the digestive system. Parasites that cause diarrhea include <span class="italic">Giardia lamblia, Entamoeba histolytica, and Cryptosporidium.</span></p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Functional bowel disorders:</bold> Diarrhea can be a symptom of irritable bowel syndrome.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Intestinal diseases:</bold> Inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, and celiac disease often lead to diarrhea.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Food intolerances and sensitivities:</bold> Some people have difficulty digesting certain ingredients, such as lactose, the sugar found in milk and milk products. Some people may have diarrhea if they eat certain types of sugar substitutes in excessive quantities.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Reaction to medicines:</bold> Antibiotics, cancer drugs, and antacids-containing magnesium can all cause diarrhea</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch5lev4sec25"><h4 class="title">Signs and Symptoms of Diarrhea</h4>
<p class="noindent">Diarrhea may be accompanied by cramping, abdominal pain, nausea, an urgent need to use the bathroom, or loss of bowel control. Some infections that cause diarrhea can also cause a fever and chills or bloody stools.</p>

<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Most cases of diarrhea resolve spontaneously within a few days and all that is needed is preventing dehydration by replacing lost fluids, according to the NIH.</p></li>
<li><p class="">In the meantime, various over-the-counter medications may help firm the stool and decrease the urgency for bowel movements.</p></li>
<li><p class="">These include loperamide hydrochloride (commonly known as the brand name Imodium AD), bismuth subsalicylate (brand name Pepto-Bismol) and attapulgite (brand name Kaopectate).</p></li>
<li><p class="">These medications however are not recommended for diarrhea caused by bacterial infection or parasites, according to the NIH, since organisms will be trapped in the intestines if the diarrhea ceases before they are completely excreted.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Recommends drinking 2 to 3 quarts or liters of liquids daily while recovering from diarrhea. While water is fine, it does not replace lost salt or nutrients, so better choices are broth, tea with honey, sports drinks and pulp-free juices.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Avoid milk products, caffeine, alcohol, and apple and pear juices since they may worsen diarrhea.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Soft, bland foods are recommended as well, including bananas, plain rice, toast, crackers, boiled potatoes, smooth peanut butter, cottage cheese, noodles and applesauce.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Because yogurt, cheese and miso contain probiotics, which contain strains of bacteria similar to those in a healthy intestine, they are also good choices. Avoid fatty, high-fiber or heavily seasoned foods for several days.</p></li>

<p class="noindent">Flatulence is defined in the medical literature as “flatus expelled through the anus” or the “quality or state of being flatulent” which is defined in turn as “marked by or affected with gases generated in the intestine or stomach; likely to cause digestive flatulence” The root of these words is from the Latin <span class="italic">flatus—</span>“a blowing, a breaking wind”. Flatus is also the medical word for gas generated in the stomach or bowels.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Flatulence is the expulsion of gas from the gastrointestinal tract through the rectum.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Daily, the average person produces 1 to 4 points of gas and expels it up to 14 times. Eating certain foods or drinking carbonated beverages can introduce air into the stomach and increase flatulence.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The person may also swallow air when you eat too quickly or when you chew gum. Because infants frequently swallow air when feeding, they may have flatulence after they have been fed.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The act of burping an infant helps relieve the discomfort caused by swallowed air.</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="ch5lev4sec30"><h4 class="title">Causes of Flatulence (<a href="#ch5fig37" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 5.37</a>)</h4>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Excessive swallowing of air sometimes occurs with anxiety, rapid food or fluid ingestion, improper use of drinking straws, ingestion of large amounts of carbonated beverages, gum chewing, candy sucking and smoking. Swallowed air is usually eliminated by burping or belching.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Gases produced by bacterial activity in the large intestine are eliminated through the anus.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Other causes of flatulence can be certain gas forming foods, such as cabbage, onions, etc., and medications that decrease intestinal motility.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Flatulence is noticed postoperatively due to the effects of anesthesia, narcotics, dietary changes and reduction in activity.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Gas that diffuses from the blood stream into the intestine.</p></li>

</div><div class="section" id="ch5lev1sec26"><h1 class="title">NURSES ROLE EFFECTIVE BOWEL MANAGEMENT</h1>
<p class="noindent">The aims of effective bowel management are to “achieve regular, predictable emptying, at a socially acceptable time and place, avoiding constipation and unplanned evacuations”. Bowel problems include—constipation—dry, hard stool that is difficult to expel because it is stuck in the lower intestine. The stool can appear like small round pellets or balls. Causes include lack of stool softeners, not using suppositories, lack of adequate fluid intake, lack of exercise and certain foods, such as rice, potatoes, pasta, cheese, bananas.</p>
<p class="noindent"><bold>Diarrhea:</bold> Loose water stools, and can be caused by flu, illness, medications and foods, and can be a sign of impaction. Causes include high anxiety, occasionally antibiotics or other medications, constipation and certain foods, such as papayas, mangoes, excessive alcohol intake, beans.</p>
<p class="noindent"><bold>Hemorrhoids:</bold> Condition in which the veins in and around the anus or lower rectum become inflamed and swollen. They can begin to itch, bleed and cause pain. They can be internal or external. The best way to prevent hemorrhoids is to keep stools soft so they can pass easily. Many creams are available to decrease the symptoms however, in some cases, they may have to be surgically removed. A colostomy may be performed in extreme cases. A colostomy is a cut in the large intestine to create an artificial opening to the exterior of the abdomen. It serves as an artificial anus in which bowel movements fall into a collection pouch that is anchored to the abdominal skin.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch5lev2sec159"><h2 class="title">Urinary Elimination Assessment</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Assessment of the urinary system includes asking questions about voiding habits, frequency, and if there is difficult or painful urination.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The bladder may be palpated above the symphysis pubis for distention. If the patient has incontinence, the perineal area should be inspected for skin breakdown.</p></li>
<li><p class="">If urinary retention is suspected, a post-void residual amount may be measured by using a bladder scanner or by straight urinary catheterization.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch5lev2sec160"><h2 class="title">Bowel Elimination Assessment</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Subjective assessment of the bowel system includes asking about the patient's normal bowel pattern, the date of the last bowel movement, characteristics of the stool, and if any changes have occurred recently in stool characteristics or pattern.</p></li>
<li><p class="">A normal pattern is typically one bowel movement every one to three days with stools having a soft or formed consistency.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Based on the patient's answers, additional questions can be included, such as bowel routines/toileting, the amount of fiber and fluid in the daily diet, daily activity, and the use of opioid medications.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Keep in mind that patients who have recently undergone diagnostic procedures that include barium contrast can have significant hardening of the stool if the barium is not expelled within a day or two of the procedure.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Patients are typically prescribed a stimulant laxative (such as Milk of Magnesia) to promote barium expulsion after these types of procedures.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Additionally, patients who have recently had abdominal surgical procedures under general anesthesia are at increased risk of paralytic ileus.<a name="page219"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">219</span></span></p></li>

<li><p class="">Before administering laxatives and stool softeners, always assess the patient's recent stool characteristics and withhold medication if loose stools or diarrhea are occurring.</p></li>
<li><p class="">In the same manner, when administering medications for a patient with diarrhea, assess recent stool consistency and bowel pattern and withhold medication if the diarrhea is resolved or constipation is developing.<a name="page220"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">220</span></span></p></li>

<p class="noindent">Assisting patients with elimination is an essential aspect of the nurse's role and has important medical significance as well as psychosocial effects on the client's quality of life. As the pattern of healthy bowel movements and urination vary in different patient groups, the management for each patient population may differ. Nurses need to assist with healthy elimination patterns to ensure patients are having regular soft bowel movements and adequate urination and to identify abnormal patterns such as flatulence, constipation, diarrhea, incontinence, fecal impaction, hemorrhoids as well as polyuria, anuria, and other abnormalities which can be signs of underlying medical conditions.</p>
