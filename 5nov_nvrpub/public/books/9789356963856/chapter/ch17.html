<p class="noindent">Perioperative nursing includes activities performed by the registered nurse during preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative phases of the patient's surgical experiences.<a name="page632"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">632</span></span> Surgery became a medical specialty, because often the treatment of a wide variety of illness and injuries include some types of surgical intervention. Surgery is an invasive method of treatment that may be planned or unplanned, major or minor, and that may involve any body part or system. Care for the client during all phases of the surgical experience needs to be continuous, and integrated surgical procedures require physical and psychosocial adaptations and are stressors for both the client and the family. The client's recovery from a surgical procedure requires skillful and knowledgeable nursing care whether the surgery is of outpatient or in the hospital setting. Nurses working in both settings must understand the principles of caring for surgical clients.</p>
</div><div class="section" id="ch17lev1sec3"><h1 class="title">DEFINITION AND CONCEPT OF PERIOPERATIVE NURSING</h1>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Perioperative nursery refers to the role of the nurse during the preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative phases of a client's surgical experience. The concept of perioperative nursing stresses the importance of providing continuity of care.</p></li>
<li><p class="">A perioperative nurse is defined as the registered nurse, who, using the nursing process, designs, coordinates and delivers care to meet the identified needs of the clients whose protective reflexes or self-care abilities are potentially compromised because they are under the influence of anesthesia during operative or other invasive procedures.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Perioperative nurse possesses and applies knowledge of the procedure and the client's intraoperative experience throughout the client-care continuum. And also they assess, diagnose, plan, intervene and evaluate the outcome of interventions based on criteria and support of a standard care targeted towards the population.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The perioperative nurse addresses the changing physiological, pathophysiological, sociocultural and spiritual responses of the client that have been initiated by the prospect of performance of the invasive procedure.</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="ch17lev2sec1"><h2 class="title">Objectives of Perioperative Nursing</h2>
<p class="noindent">The nurse must have a basic understanding of operating room techniques. She plays an important role to plan and manage the care during different phases in order to meet individualized needs. She must have the knowledge about the operative site and procedure, effect of the anesthesia and the operative trauma to the patient. The nurse can participate in pen operative nursing.</p>

<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">To apply nursing process to nursing actions.</p></li>
<li><p class="">To promote an understanding of the patient's total surgical experience by demonstrating the ability to assess physiologic, psychologic and sociologic patient needs.</p></li>
<li><p class="">To reinforce basic knowledge of the total patient experience as a basis for management of preoperative patient's anxiety related to body image and postoperative pain related to intraoperative procedure.</p></li>
<li><p class="">To assist the patient to relieve anxiety preoperatively and by assessing their needs for psychologic support.</p></li>
<li><p class="">To recognize the effects of preoperative, medications, anesthesia, positioning at procedure as the basis for planning the patient's postoperative recovery and rehabilitation.</p></li>
<li><p class="">To become an effective communicator with patients through preoperative and postoperative teaching based on the knowledge of the intraoperative procedure.</p></li>

<div class="section" id="ch17lev2sec2"><h2 class="title">Phases of Perioperative Nursing (<a href="#ch17fig1" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 17.1</a>)</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Preoperative phase:</bold> This is the phase of the patient's surgical experience begins when the decision is made to undergo surgical intervention. This phase ends when the patient is transferred to the operating table. During this phase, the nurse gathers data by doing assessment and plan components of nursing process. The nurse identifies the patient's physiologic, psychologic and spiritual needs and finds existing or potential problems. Preoperative phase begins where the decision for surgical intervention is made and ends with transference of the client to the operative site.<a name="page633"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">633</span></span> Nursing activities range from a baseline assessment of the client during the preoperative interview and continues with assessment in the preadmission unit, client room, holding area, or induction room on the day of surgery. Before surgery, the nurse prepares the client and family for the surgery, performs diagnostic tests, and assesses the client in preparation for the operation.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Intraoperative phase:</bold> This phase begins with transfer of the patient to the operating table and extends to the time the patient is admitted to the recovery area. It begins where the client is transferred to the operating room bed and ends when the client is transferred to an area of recovery from anesthesia. In this phase, nursing interventions range from communicating the clients plan of care, identifying nursing activities, necessary for expected outcome and establishing priorities for nursing actions. During surgery, the nurse assists surgeons and other operating room nurses to ensure that the client receives optimal care. The nurse also coordinates client needs with team members and personnel's from other disciplines, coordinates the use of the supplies and equipment, controls the environment, prepares for potential emergencies, and communicates and documents the client's plan of care.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Postoperative phase:</bold> This phase begins with admission of the patient to the recovery area which includes post-anesthesia care unit or an intensive care unit. This phase ends when the surgeon discontinues follow-up-care. It begins with the client's transfer to an area for recovery and ends with client's recovery from surgery. Nursing activities range from communicating pertinent information about the client's surgery, to assist the client to be physical stability and wakefulness and institute measures to help the client achieve maximum recovery.</p></li>

<div class="section" id="ch17lev2sec3"><h2 class="title">Classifications of Surgical Procedures</h2>
<p class="noindent">Surgery can be defined as the art and science of treating diseases, injuries and deformities by operation and instrumentation. The surgical procedure involves the interaction of the patient, the surgeon, and the nurse. Surgical procedures usually are classified on the basis of urgency, degree of risk, and purposes.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch17lev2sec4"><h2 class="title">I. Based on Urgency</h2>
<p class="noindent">Surgery may be classified as elective surgery, urgent surgery and emergency surgery.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Elective surgery:</bold> It is preplanned and performed on the basis of client's choice. It is not essential and may not be necessary for health and delay in surgery has no ill effects, can be scheduled in advance based on the choice of client. The purposes of elective surgery are as follows: (a) To remove or repair a body part, (b) To restore function, (c) To improve health, (d) To improve self-concept. For example, tonsillectomy, hernia repair, cataract extraction and lens implant, hip prosthesis, hemorrhoiditis, etc., Urgent surgery in which the surgery is the necessity for the client's health, but not an emergency. This is performed for the purposes as in elective surgery and to prevent further tissue damage. For example, removal of gallbladder, coronary artery, removal of tumor, etc.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Emergency surgery:</bold> When surgery must be done immediately to preserve the client's life, remove or repair body part, restore function, improve health and self concept. For example, control of hemorrhage, repair of trauma, perforated ulcer, intestinal obstruction, tracheostomy, cesarean section.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch17lev2sec5"><h2 class="title">II. Based on Degree of Risk or Seriousness</h2>
<p class="noindent">Surgery has been classified as major or minor on the basis of risk for the client:<a name="page634"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">634</span></span></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Major surgery:</bold> It involves extensive reconstruction or alteration in body parts poses great risks to wellbeing. It requires hospitalization usually prolonged to well-being; has a high degree of risk; involves major body organs, life threatening situations and potential postoperative complications. Major surgery may be elective, urgent, or emergency. For example, nephrectomy, cholecystectomy, colostomy, hysterectomy.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Minor surgery:</bold> It is primarily elective; it is usually a brief, carries low-risk and results in few complications. It can be performed in clinics, outpatient clinic and minor operation theaters. For example, teeth extraction, removal of warts, skin biopsy, laparoscopy, dilatations and curettage.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch17lev2sec6"><h2 class="title">III. Based on Purpose</h2>
<p class="noindent">Surgical procedures based on purpose include diagnostic, ablative, palliative, reconstructive, transplant, constructive.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Diagnostic:</bold> It is surgical exploration that allows physician to make or to confirm diagnosis, may involve removal of tissue for further diagnostic testing. For example, breast biopsy, laparoscopy, bronchoscopy, exploratory laparotomy (incision in peritoneal cavity to inspect abdominal organs).</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Ablative:</bold> It is excision or removal of diseased body part. For example, appendicectomy, subtotal thyroidectomy, partial gastrectomy, colon resection, amputation, cholecystectomy, etc.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Palliative surgery:</bold> It is performed to relieve or reduce intensity of an illness or disease symptoms will not produce cure. For example, colostomy, nerve root resection (rhizotomy) debridement of necrotic tissue, balloon angioplasty, arthroscopy, etc.</p>
<p class="indent"><bold>4. Reconstructive surgery:</bold> It is performed to restore function to traumatized or malfunctioning tissues and to improve self-concept. For example, scar revision, plastic surgery, skin graft, internal fixation of fractures, breast reconstruction.</p>
<p class="indent"><bold>5. Transplant:</bold> It is performed to replace organs or structures that are diseased or malfunctioning. For example, kidney, cornea, liver, heart, joints, total hip replacement.</p>
<p class="indent"><bold>6. Constructive surgery:</bold> It is performed to restore function lost or reduced as a result of congenital anomalies. For example, repair of cleft palate, closure of atrial defect in heart. <bold><a href="#ch17fig3" class="ulink-inter">Figure 17.3</a></bold> shows the surgical team.</p></li>

<div class="section" id="ch17lev4sec4"><h4 class="title">Nurse's role and responsibilities</h4>
<p class="noindent">The nurse is responsible for the preparation and safety of the client on the day of surgery.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Skin preparation:</bold> The skin is cleaned by scrubbing the operative site one or more times with an antiseptic soap or solution to remove bacteria. This can be done by the client while taking a bath or shower. Ideally, a shower is taken in the evening before the morning of surgery. Shampooing the hair and the cleaning of the fingernails also help to reduce number of organism present. The incision area usually is shaved before surgery because hair serves as a reservoir of bacteria. Usually the operative area is washed before surgery with an antiseptic, such as povidone iodine (Betadine) to clean and disinfect the skin.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Elimination:</bold> The gastrointestinal tract needs special preparation on the evening before surgery to:
<ul style="list-style-type: square">
<li><p class="">Reduce the possibility of vomiting and aspiration during anesthesia.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Reduce the possibility of a bowel obstruction.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Prevent contamination from fecal material during intestinal tract or bowel surgery.</p>
<p class="indent">Emptying the bowel of feces in no longer routine procedure before surgery, but the nurse should use preoperative assessment to determine the need for an order of bowel elimination. If the client is scheduled for surgery of the GI tract, cleansing enema usually ordered. Insertion of an indwelling urinary catheter may be ordered before surgery, especially in clients having pelvic surgery, to prevent bladder distention or accidental injury. If an indwelling catheter is not in place, the client should void immediately before receiving premeditation to ensure an empty bladder during surgery.</p></li></ul></p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Nutrition and fluids:</bold> Preparation involves restricting food and fluid. If a client undergoing surgery is to receive a general anesthesia, foods and fluids are restricted 8 to 10 hours before the operation. This restriction significantly reduces the possibility of aspirations of gastric contents, which can cause aspiration pneumonia. Most clients have an NPO status after midnight.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Rest and sleep:</bold> These are important components in reducing stress before surgery and in healing and recovery after surgery. The nurse can facilitate rest and sleep in the immediate preoperative period by meeting psychological needs, carrying out teaching, providing a quiet environment, and administering prescribed bedtime sedative medication.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent"><bold>The nurse's responsibility on the day of surgery will include the following:</bold></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Note allergies according to institutional policy.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Take and record the vital signs, assess arid report the abnormalities for elevated, temperature.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Check the identification band to make sure it is legible, accurate and securely fastened to the client.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Be sure that informed consent has been obtained and is clearly documented.</p></li>
<li><p class="">If a skin preparation has been ordered, check that it has been completed accurately and thoroughly.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Check for the carry out any special orders, such as administering enema or starting on line, recurred previous records, inserting nasogastric tube, giving medications.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Verify that the client has not eaten for the last 8 hours. Check that fluids have been restricted although sometimes the physician will order clients to take their usual oral medication with a small sip of water.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Ask the client to void measure and record the amount of urine (if indicated).</p></li>
<li><p class="">Assist the client with oral hygiene if necessary Kelp the client to remove jewelry to prevent loss or injury from swelling, during or after surgery. Many facilities allow the client to keep wedding band or mangala suthra (tali) on as long as they are taped securely. If Jewelry is removed, it should be stored according to policy or given to authorized member of their family.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Remove all hairpins or hairpieces. This prevents injury to the client during surgery as well as possible loss or hairpieces or wigs.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Remove colored nail polish from at least one nail for the pulse oximeter to allow intraoperative and postoperative assessment of kin and nail beds for circulation and oxygenation of tissues.</p></li>
<li><p class="">If the client is wearing hearing aid, notify the operating room nurse. Leave it in place so dint operating room personnel know it is there and an communicate with the client.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Remove all prosthesis, such as dentures, or partial plates, eye glasses, contact lenses and artificial limbs and store them safely dentures may cause respiratory, distress).</p></li>
<li><p class="">Give the preoperative medications that are prescribed, either at a scheduled time or “on call”. The commonly ordered medications are:
<ul style="list-style-type: square">
<li><p class="">Sedatives and tranquilizers to alleviate anxiety and facilitate anesthesia induction, e.g., nembutol, chloropromozen, or diazopen.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Anticholinesterase to decrease pulmonary and oral secretions to prevent laryngospasm, e.g., atropine.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Narcotic analgesics to facilitate client's sedation and relaxation and to decrease the amount of anesthetic agent need, e.g., morphine.</p>

<div class="section" id="ch17lev2sec10"><h2 class="title">Definition</h2>
<p class="noindent">The term “intraoperative” refers to the time during surgery. Intraoperative care is patient care during an operation and ancillary to that operation. Activities, such as monitoring the patient's vital signs, blood oxygenation levels, fluid therapy, medication transfusion, anesthesia, radiography, and retrieving samples for laboratory tests, are examples of intraoperative care. intraoperative care is provided by nurses, anesthesiologists, nurse anesthetists, surgical technicians, surgeons, and residents, all working as a team.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch17lev2sec11"><h2 class="title">Purpose of Intraoperative Care</h2>
<p class="noindent">The purpose of intraoperative care is to maintain patient safety and comfort during surgical procedures. Some of the goals of intraoperative care include maintaining homeostasis during the procedure, maintaining strict sterile techniques to decrease the chance of cross-infection, ensuring that the patient is secure on the operating table, and taking measures to prevent hematomas from safety strips or from positioning.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch17lev2sec12"><h2 class="title">Anesthesia</h2>
<p class="noindent">Anesthesia means the absence of pain (Greek: an meaning without + esthesis = feeling). Anesthesia is an artificially-induced state of partial or total loss of sensation, with or without loss of consciousness. Anesthesia produces muscle relaxation, blocks transmission of nerve impulses and suppresses reflexes. There are two types of anesthesia, i.e., general anesthesia and regional anesthesia.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch17lev3sec6"><h3 class="title">General Anesthesia</h3>
<p class="noindent">General anesthesia is a drug-induced depression of the central nervous system (CNS) that is reverted either by metabolic elimination in the body or by pharmacologic means. General anesthetic agents produce analgesia, amnesia and unconsciousness, characterized by loss of reflexes and muscle tone. There are four stages of anesthesia.</p>
<p class="indent">Onset Starts from anesthetic administration to loss of consciousness. In this stage, client may be drowsy or dizzy and may experience auditory or visual hallucinations. Nursing action in this stage will include, close operating room doors, keeping room quiet, and stand by to assist client.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch17lev4sec5"><h4 class="title">Excitement</h4>
<p class="noindent">Starts from loss of consciousness to loss of eyelid reflexes. Here there will be increase in automatic activity, irregular breathing. In such a case client may struggle. In this stage, nurse has to remain quietly as client's side, assist anesthetists if needed.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch17lev4sec6"><h4 class="title">Surgical Anesthesia</h4>
<p class="noindent">This stage starts with loss of eyelid reflexes, to loss of motor reflexes and depression of vital functions. Here client is unconscious, muscles are relaxed and no blink or gag reflexes.<a name="page642"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">642</span></span> In this stage, begins preparation (if indicated) only when anesthetists indicate stage III has been reached and client is under good control.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch17lev4sec7"><h4 class="title">Danger (Death) Stage</h4>
<p class="noindent">Vital functions too depressed may lead to respiratory and circulatory failure. In this stage, client is not breathing and he may or may not have a heart beat. If arrest occurs, nurse responses immediately to assist establishing airway, provides cardiac arrest tray, drugs, syringes, long needles, assist surgeon with closed or open cardiac massage.</p>
<p class="indent">General anesthesia can be administered by inhalation or intravenously. An inhalation agent will include nitrous oxide, halothane (fluothene), enflurase (enthrane) and isofluorane (porane) and the intravenous drugs are thiopental sodium (pentothal), fentanyl citrate droperidol (innovar) and ketamine hydrochloride. The selections of anesthetic agents are according to decision of the anesthesiologist. But continuous monitoring of side effects of the drugs, vital signs are essential.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch17lev3sec7"><h3 class="title">Regional Anesthesia</h3>
<p class="noindent">Regional anesthesia blocks the pain stimulus at the origin and along afferent neurons of along the spinal cord. Regional anesthesia produces a loss of painful sensation in only one region of the body and does not result in unconsciousness. The client may receive sedative that produces drowsiness.</p>
<p class="indent">The regional anesthetic agents block the conduction of impulses in nerve fiber without depolarizing the cell membrane are: Local agents and topical agents. An example of local agents is Bupivacaine HCL (Marcaine HCL) (Xylocaine) and examples of topical agents will include Benzocaine, Ethylchloride spray, Tetracaine HCL. All these agents have their own side effects. Contraindication for children. Test dose can be given prior to use, of these agents to know any allergies to these agents.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch17lev3sec8"><h3 class="title">The Types of Regional Anesthesia are as follows:</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p class="">Topical anesthesia</p></li>
<li><p class="">Local infiltration anesthesia</p></li>
<li><p class="">Field block anesthesia</p></li>

<li><p class="">Spinal anesthesia</p></li>
<li><p class="">Epidural anesthesia</p></li>
<li><p class="">Caudal anesthesia.</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="indent">The other types of anesthesia are used in modern drugs acupuncture, cryothermia and hypnoanesthesia. The type of anesthesia chosen depends on the surgery performed and level of unconsciousness desired. <bold><a href="#ch17fig10" class="ulink-inter">Figure 17.10</a></bold> shows the local anesthetic agents.</p>

<div class="section" id="ch17lev2sec13"><h2 class="title">Nursing Care during Surgery</h2>
<p class="noindent">Nursing care during surgery will include providing emotional care, assisting the client with positioning (as require and for type of surgery). Maintaining safety, maintaining surgical asepsis, prevent client's heat loss, monitoring malignant hyperthermia, assisting with surgeon to perform surgery by providing proper equipments and supplies, assisting with wound closure, assessing drainage, and transferring client to recovery room.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch17lev2sec14"><h2 class="title">Intraoperative Nursing Interventions</h2>
<p class="noindent">Nursing assessment of the intraoperative patient involves obtaining data from the patient and the patient's record to identify variables that can affect care and serve as guidelines for developing an individualized plan of patient care. The intraoperative nurse uses the focused preoperative nursing assessment documented on the patient record. This includes assessment of physiologic status (e.g., health-illness level, level of consciousness), psychological status (e.g., anxiety level, verbal communication problems, coping mechanisms), and physical status (e.g., surgical site, skin condition, and effectiveness of preparation; immobile joints), and ethical concerns.</p>

<p class="noindent">The postoperative phase of surgery is final phase of the surgical experience. Nursing plays a critical role in returning the client to an optimal level of functioning. The postoperative period can be divided into two phases, i.e., immediate post-anesthesia and postoperative period, and later in postoperative phase.<a name="page644"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">644</span></span></p>
<div class="section" id="ch17lev2sec15"><h2 class="title">Immediate Postoperative Phase</h2>
<p class="noindent">Immediate postoperative phase is the first few hours after surgery when the client is recovering from the effect of anesthesia. Here the nurse has to keep all emergency equipment and drugs, etc., for the use of patient's recovery from anesthesia and on admission to postoperative unit, the nurse performs the following <bold>(<a href="#ch17tbl1" class="ulink-inter">Table 17.1</a>)</bold>:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Assess airway patency and support as needed, and assess for the presence of hoarseness, cramp, strider, wheezes or decreased breath sounds</p></li>
<li><p class="">Applies humidified oxygen via nasal cannula or facemask (unless otherwise ordered)</p></li>
<li><p class="">Records vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, strength and regularity, respiratory rate and depth, oxygen saturation, skin color, and temperature) <bold>(<a href="#ch17fig13" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 17.13</a>)</bold></p></li>
<li><p class="">Assess the client's level of consciousness, muscle strength and ability to follow commands</p></li>
<li><p class="">Observe the client's IV infusions, dressings, drains and special equipment</p></li>
<li><p class="">Remain at the client's bedside, continuing close observations of the client's conditions. After the client has been positioned safely and the baseline vital signs status has been ascertained, the nurse receives verbal report regarding surgery in detail, i.e., type of surgery, time of incision, patient's condition during surgery, type of anesthesia, sedative, all untoward incident happened and everything about surgery and documents the reliable and retainable information for further care that follow surgeon's and anesthetist's instructions for patient's recovery.</p></li>

<div class="section" id="ch17lev3sec13"><h3 class="title">Minor Complications</h3>
<p class="noindent">Dryness of the mouth and throat, sore throat, drowsiness, shivering, vomiting, dizziness, and giddiness are common side effects of the medicines used during anesthesia. They are self-limiting and do not persist beyond an hour or two. Fatigue, feeling weak, headache are also common and could be attributed to the fasting that is often required before and after a surgery.</p>
<p class="indent">Under normal circumstances these symptoms vanish in a day or two. Some people also experience bloated feeling, constipation and urine retention following an operation and these resolve spontaneously. Fever can occur as a reaction to the intravenous fluid transfused during an operation.</p>

<p class="noindent">Wounds (injury to tissues) vary from minor lacerations to severe crushing injuries. Life-threatening problems, such as airway obstruction, hemorrhage, and shock, must be dealt with before the wound is treated. A wound is an injury in which the skin is cut or penetrated. For instance a knife, bullet, ice pick or wood splinter may inflict a wound. If the wound is deep, severe bleeding may occur or there may be serious damage to structures within the body, such as the stomach, lungs or brain. Depending on how they are caused, e.g., by blunt force, sharp weapon or firearm.</p>

<li><p class=""><bold>Incised wounds:</bold> These are made by a clean cut with a sharp instrument, for example, those made by the surgeon in every surgical procedure.

<li><p class=""><bold>Clean wounds:</bold> These are uninfected surgical wounds in which there is no inflammation and the respiratory, alimentary, genital, or uninfected urinary tracts are not entered.

<div class="section" id="ch17lev2sec23"><h2 class="title">Wound Healing Process</h2>
<p class="noindent">Various continuous and overlapping cellular processes contribute to the restoration of a wound; cell regeneration, cell proliferation, and collagen production. The response of tissue to injury goes through several phases, i.e., inflammatory, proliferative and maturation.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch17lev3sec17"><h3 class="title">Inflammatory Phase</h3>
<p class="noindent">Vascular and cellular responses occur immediately when tissue is cut or injured. Vasoconstriction of vessels occurs and a fibrinoplatelet clot forms in an attempt to control bleeding. This reaction lasts from 5 to 10 minutes and is followed by vasodilation of the venues. Microcirculation loses its vasoconstriction ability because norepinephrine is destroyed by the intracellular enzymes. Also histamine is released, which increases capillary permeability.</p>
<p class="indent">When the microcirculation is damaged, blood elements, such as antibodies, plasma proteins, electrolytes, complement and water permeate the vascular space for 2 to 3 days, causing edema, warmth, redness and pain. Neutrophils are the first leukocytes to move into damaged tissue. Monocytes that transform to macrophages engulf the debris and transport it from the area. Antigen- antibodies also appear. Basal cells at the wound edges undergo mitosis, and the resulting daughter cells migrate.</p>
<p class="indent">With this activity, proteolytic enzymes are secreted and dissolve the base of blood clots. The gap between both sides eventually meets in 24 to 48 hours. At this point, cell migration is enhanced by hyperplastic bone marrow activity.</p>

<p class="noindent">Fibroblasts multiply and form a lattice framework for migrating cells. Epithelial cells from buds at the edges of the wound; these buds develop into capillaries, the nutritional source for the new granulation tissue.</p>
<p class="indent">Collagen is the primary component of replaced connective tissue. Fibroblasts initiate the synthesis of collagen and mucopolysaccharides. In a period of 2–4 weeks, amino acid chains form into fibers of increasing length and diameter; these fibers become a well-structured pattern of packed bundles. The synthesis of collagen causes capillaries to decrease in number. Thereafter, collagen synthesis decreases in an attempt to balance the amount of collagen that is destroyed. Such synthesis and lysis result in increased tensile strength.</p>

<p class="indent">After 2 weeks, the wound has only 3–5% of the original skin strength. By the end of a month, only 35–59% of wound strength has been reached. Never more than 70–80% of strength is regained. Many vitamins, particularly vitamin C, aid in the metabolic process involved in wound healing.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch17lev3sec19"><h3 class="title">Maturation Phase</h3>
<p class="noindent">About 3 weeks after injury, fibroblasts begin to leave the wound. The scar appears large, until collagen fibrils reorganize into tighter positions. This, along with dehydration, reduces the scar but increases its strength. Such tissue maturation continues and reaches maximum strength in 10 or 12 weeks, but it never reaches the original strength of the prewound tissue.</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p class=""><bold>Healing by first intention (primary union):</bold> Wounds made aseptically, with a minimum of tissue destruction, and properly closed, as with sutures heal with little tissue reaction by first intention. When wounds heal by first intention, granulation tissue is not visible and scar formation is minimal.<a name="page655"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">655</span></span></p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Healing by second intention (granulation)::</bold> In wounds in which pus formation (suppuration) has occurred or in which the edges have not been approximated, the process of repair is less simple and takes longer.</p>
<p class="indent">When an abscess is incised it collapses partly, but the dead and the dying cells forming its walls are still being released into the cavity. For this reason, drainage tubes or gauze packing is often inserted into the abscess pocket to allow drainage to escape easily. Gradually, the necrotic material disintegrates and escapes easily and the abscess cavity fills with a red, soft, sensitive tissue that bleeds very easily. This tissue is composed of minute, thin-walled capillaries and buds that later form connective tissue.</p>
<p class="indent">These buds called granulations enlarge until they fill the area left by the destroyed tissue. The cells surrounding the capillaries change their round shape to become long, thin, and intertwined with each other to form a scar or cicatrix. Healing is complete when skin cells (epithelium) grow over these granulations. This method of repair is called healing by granulation, and it takes place whenever pus is formed or when loss of tissue has occurred for any reason.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Healing by third intention (secondary suture):</bold> If a deep wound either has not been sutured early or breaks down and then is re-sutured later, two opposing granulation surfaces are brought together. This results in a deeper and wider scar.</p></li>

<div class="section" id="ch17lev2sec25"><h2 class="title">Complications of Wound</h2>
<p class="noindent">The nurse must know when to suspect complications that necessitate inspection of the wound. The following are a guide that all may not be well:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Continued presence of pain.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Swelling and/or redness around the wound.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Persistent rise of temperature and/or an increasing pulse rate.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Presence of toxemia, indicated by the onset of vomiting, diarrhea, loss of appetite and increasing pallor.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Discharge from the wound.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Any symptoms of tetanus—very rare nowadays.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Any symptoms of too tight a plaster or dressing, e.g., pain, tingling or cyanosis of the tips of the fingers or toes.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">The following complications can occur in a wound:</p>
<div class="section" id="ch17lev3sec21"><h3 class="title">Hematoma (Hemorrhage)</h3>
<p class="noindent">The dressings are inspected for hemorrhage at frequent intervals during the first 24 hours after surgery. Any undue amount of bleeding is reported. At times, concealed bleeding occurs in the wound, beneath the skin. This hemorrhage usually stops spontaneously but results in clot formation within the wound. If the clot is small, it will be absorbed and need not to be treated. When the clot is large, the wound usually bulges somewhat, and healing will be delayed unless it is removed. After several sutures are removed by the physician, the clot is evacuated and the wound is packed lightly with gauze. Healing occurs usually by granulation, or a secondary closure may be performed.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch17lev3sec22"><h3 class="title">Infection (Wound Sepsis)</h3>
<p class="noindent"><bold>Surgical wound infections:</bold> These are the second most frequent nosocomial infection in hospitals. The most important area of prevention lies in meticulous wound management and surgical technique. In addition, cleanliness and environmental disinfection are important. <span class="italic">Staphylococcus aureus</span> accounts for many postoperative wound infections. Other infections may result from <span class="italic">Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris</span>, <span class="italic">Enterobacter aerogenes</span>, <span class="italic">Pseudomonas aeruginosa</span>, and other organisms.</p>
<p class="indent">When the inflammatory process occurs, it usually causes symptoms in 36 to 48 hours. The patient's pulse rate and temperature increase, the WBC count rises, and the wound usually becomes swollen, warm and tender with incisional pain. Local signs may be absent when the infection is deep. When a diagnosis of wound infection in a postoperative wound is made, the surgeon usually removes one or more sutures and, under aseptic precautions, separates the wound edges with a pair of blunt scissors or a hemostat. Once the incision is opened, a drain is inserted.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch17lev3sec23"><h3 class="title">Cellulites</h3>
<p class="noindent">It is a bacterial infection that spreads into tissue planes. All the manifestations of inflammation are evident; Streptococcus is frequently the responsible organism. Systemic antibiotics are usually effective. If an extremity is the site of the infection, elevation reduces dependent edema and the application of heat promotes local blood circulation. Rest decreases muscular contractions that could introduce the offending organisms into the circulatory system.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch17lev3sec24"><h3 class="title">Abscess</h3>
<p class="noindent">If is a localized bacterial infection characterized by a collection of pus (bacteria, necrotic tissue, and WBC's). Usually a “point” develops that is tender. Because the area is under pressure, there is a tendency for the infection to seed bacteria that may invade adjacent tissues (cellulites) or vascular spaces (bacteremia, sepsis). Treatment is surgical drainage or excision and the administration of antibiotics. Recurrence is prevented by allowing the treated wound to drain. Rest, elevation of the part and heat are helpful.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch17lev2sec26"><h2 class="title">Lymphangitis</h2>
<p class="noindent">It is a spread of infection from a cellulitis or abscess to the lymphatic system. This is treated by rest and antibiotics.<a name="page656"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">656</span></span></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch17lev2sec27"><h2 class="title">Dehiscence and Evisceration</h2>
<p class="noindent">The complications of dehiscence (disruption of surgical incision of wound) and evisceration (protrusion of wound contents) are especially serious when they involve abdominal incisions or wounds. These complications result from sutures giving way, from infection, and, more frequently, after marked distention or strenuous cough. They may also occur because of increasing age, poor nutritional status, and the presence of pulmonary or cardiovascular disease in patients who undergo abdominal surgery.</p>
<p class="indent">When the wound edges separate slowly, the intestines may protrude gradually, or not at all, and the earliest sign may be a push of bloody (serosanguineous) peritoneal fluid from the wound. When the rupture of a wound occurs suddenly coils of intestine may push out of the abdomen. Frequently, the patient may say that “something gave way”. The evisceration causes pain and can be associated with vomiting.</p>
<p class="indent">When disruption of a wound occurs, the surgeon is notified at once. The protruding coils of intestine are covered with sterile dressings moistened with sterile saline.</p>
<p class="indent">An abdominal binder, properly applied, is an excellent prophylactic measure against an evisceration of this kind, and often it is used along with the primary dressing, especially for surgery on patients with weak or pendulous abdominal walls, or when rupture of a wound has occurred. Vitamin deficiency or lowered serum protein or chloride may require correction.</p>

</div><div class="section" id="ch17lev1sec11"><h1 class="title">SUTURING THE WOUND</h1>
<p class="noindent">Suturing of wounds primarily is the responsibility of the surgeons. Rarely, the nurses may have to undertake this responsibility. This depends upon the hospital customs.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch17lev2sec35"><h2 class="title">Types of Sutures (<a href="#ch17fig21" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 17.21</a>)</h2>
<p class="noindent">The sutures are classified into interrupted and continuous sutures. In interrupted type, each suture is tied and knotted separately. In continuous sutures, one thread runs in a series of stitches and is tied only at the beginning and at the end of the run.</p>
<p class="indent">According to the pattern of suturing, it can be classified into plain interrupted, plain continuous, mattress interrupted, mattress continuous and blanket continuous.</p>
<div class="figure" id="ch17fig21" data-label="Fig. 17.21"><div class="title"><span class="item-label">Fig. 17.21</span> Types of suturing.</div><img alt="Fig. 17.21" src="/MediumImage/657-1.jpg"><div class="additional-markup"></div></div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch17lev2sec36"><h2 class="title">Retention Sutures</h2>
<p class="noindent">Retention sutures are very large plain interrupted sutures that are seen in some incisions in addition to the skin sutures. These large sutures involve not only the skin but also the underlying tissues of fat and muscles. They are used to give support to the incisions in obese individuals or in situations in which wound dehiscence is suspected. The retention surfaces may have rubber tubing over them to prevent these sutures cutting through the skin. Usually they are left in place longer than the skin sutures (14–21 days).</p>
<p class="indent">When suturing the wound, each suture should be placed as deep as it is wide. The distance between the sutures should be equal the depth and the width.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch17lev3sec25"><h3 class="title">Suture Material</h3>
<p class="noindent">A suture is either a surgical gut (catgut) or a nonabsorbable material. Suture materials can be broadly classified into absorbable (surgical gut or catgut) and nonabsorbable (cotton silk, nylon wire, Dacron, etc.).</p>
<p class="noindent"><bold>Advantages of a surgical gut are:</bold></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">It is absorbed readily.</p></li>
<li><p class="">It is easily handled.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Available in multitude of sizes</p></li>
<li><p class="">It can be used to suture tissues beneath the skin.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent"><bold>Advantages of nonabsorbable suture are:</bold></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">They have a high tensile strength (they are not easily broken)</p></li>
<li><p class="">They are relatively inexpensive.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Less tissue reaction.</p></li>
<li><p class="">They are used on the skin and are removed.</p></li>
<li><p class="">They are used as ligatures (A ligature or a tie is a free piece of suture material used for purpose of tying blood vessels that have previously been clamped with an artery forceps).<a name="page658"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">658</span></span></p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">Surgical gut can be classified into plain gut and chromic gut. Plain gut is absorbed in 5–10 days. Chromic gut has a prolonged absorption time of 10–40 days.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch17lev3sec26"><h3 class="title">Equipment Used</h3>
<p class="noindent">If the ideal suture existed it would be biologically inert and cause no tissue reaction. It would be very strong but simply dissolve in body fluids and lose strength at the same rate that the tissue gains strength. It would be easy for the surgeon to handle and knot reliably, as well as being reasonably priced. It would neither cause nor promote complications. However, despite great improvements in suture materials, no single suture is ideal in all circumstances. Regardless of its composition, suture material is a foreign body to human tissue and will elicit a foreign body reaction to some degree.</p>
<p class="indent">Suture materials can conveniently be divided into two broad groups: absorbable and nonabsorbable. Two major mechanisms of absorption result in the degradation of absorbable sutures. Sutures of biological origin, such as catgut, are gradually digested by tissue enzymes. Sutures manufactured from synthetic polymers are principally broken down by hydrolysis in tissue fluids and are the preferred material. Nonabsorbable sutures, such as nylon, are made from a variety of nonbiodegradable materials, and are ultimately encapsulated or walled off by fibroblasts.</p>
<p class="indent">The sizes and tensile strengths of all suture materials are standardized. Size denotes the diameter of the material - and the smaller the diameter, the less tensile strength it will have. Stated numerically, the higher the first number, the smaller the diameter of the suture. Examples of suture size used are: Trunk and lower limbs 3/0, Scalp 2/0, 3/0 or 4/0, Upper limbs 4/0, Most wounds 4/0, Face 5/0, 6/0.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch17lev4sec8"><h4 class="title">Suture Needles</h4>
<p class="noindent">Suture needles are classified in different ways:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p class=""><bold>Straight and curved needles:</bold> When the wound is deep, a curved needle is used. It is used with a needle holder. Curved needles are again classified into curved, half circle, etc., For suturing the layers of the skin, a straight needle is used. Straight needles are generally used without a needle holder.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Cutting needle and non-cutting needle (round body needles):</bold> Cutting needles are three edged triangular needles. These needles may cut into the tissues to allow for the easier passage of the suture. So they are used for the suturing of dense tissues, such as skin, cervix of the uterus and tendons. Non-cutting needles are used for suturing the tissues beneath the skin.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Traumatic and atraumatic needles:</bold> Traumatic needles or eye needle has an eye or opening on one end through which the suturing material is drawn to thread it. Atraumatic needles are especially made needles with no eye. The suturing materials are inserted within the metal of the needle during the manufacturing process, so that the diameter of the suture is not greater than the needle. It has several advantages. They produce minimum tissue trauma and there is less damage to the suture strand. So they are used for suturing such delicate structures as intestines, brain, mucus membranes and nerves.</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch17lev3sec27"><h3 class="title">General Instructions</h3>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Follow strict aseptic techniques as for caring of wounds.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Clean the wounds thoroughly if contaminated with dust particles or when blood clots are present.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Control the bleeding by the application of ligatures if necessary.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Trim the ragged edges of the wounds and cut off the dead tissues, if any, using a sharp scissors.</p></li>
<li><p class="">If there is a foreign body in the wound, such as a sharp instrument or a sharp object which might have caused the wound. It should not be removed until everything is ready for the wound suturing. Removal of the object may cause heavy bleeding.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Thoroughly wound assessment should be done to detect complications.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Whenever possible, minimize the pain by the use of local anesthetic. It should be prepared in correct strength, e.g., lignocaine 1–2%. No anesthetic with adrenaline should be used unless it is ordered by the surgeon.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Antiseptics used for the wound should be non-irritating to the skin and mucus membranes.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The length of the suture material should be neither too long nor too short. The approximate length of the suture is 15 inches. When threaded, allow 12 inches on one side of the needle and 3 inches on the other side.</p></li>
<li><p class="">A curved needle is threaded from the inner curve outward to prevent the suture from falling out of the people.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Always grasp the skin edge with toothed forceps.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Space stitches evenly.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Do not tie the knots with excess tension since this will traumatize the wound. If tied too tightly, the stitches will be tighter on the next day due to edema.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The skin edges should be approximated to help in the healing of the wound and to prevent gapping of the wound.</p></li>
<li><p class="">When cutting the sutures, leave ¼ inch from the knot to prevent the knot from becoming undone. Holding the suture ends taut and at right angle to the skin, cut the suture by holding the scissors parallel to the skin.</p></li>

<div class="section" id="ch17lev2sec37"><h2 class="title">Nurse's Responsibility in the Suturing of Wounds</h2>
<p class="noindent">In almost all the hospitals, suturing of the wound is the responsibility of the doctors. However occasionally, the nurse is held responsible for suturing small wounds. This depends upon the policy of the institution.<a name="page659"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">659</span></span></p>
<div class="section" id="ch17lev3sec28"><h3 class="title">Preliminary Assessment</h3>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Assess the circumstances under which the wound was produced. This will help to evaluate the possibility of wound contamination.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Assess the nature of the wounding object, e.g., blunt, sharp, etc., this will help to assess the depth of penetration of the object and also to identify the puncture wounds.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Assess the duration of time after the injury. This will help to assess the healing process. If the wound is exposed for a prolonged period, there always is the possibility of wound infection.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Check the presence of existing illness in the patient that may influence the healing process, e.g., diabetes mellitus.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Prior healing history is to be assessed. This will help us to find out abnormal bleeding time, wound dehiscence in the past, formation of excessive scar tissue etc.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Check the drugs, the injured person has been taking, e.g., corticosteroids. This will delay the healing process.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Take a history of allergies in the past, especially allergic reaction to local anesthetics.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Date of most recent tetanus immunization. All patients with a roadside injury should be given tetanus toxoid to prevent tetanus.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Wound location and the type of wound. A penetrating wound should be sutured under general anesthesia. There is the possibility of injury of the underlying organs.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Watch for the presence of foreign bodies, presence of penetrating objects, etc., penetrating objects should not be disturbed until everything is ready for suturing, for fear of bleeding.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Assess the presence of devitalized tissues. This necessitates debridement prior to suturing.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Presence of bleeding. The bleeding points have to be ligated before suturing to prevent further bleeding.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Presence of complications, such as fractures, shock, tendon injuries, nerve injuries, etc., this necessitates further treatment.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Check the consciousness of the patient and the ability to follow instructions.</p></li>

<div class="section" id="ch17lev3sec30"><h3 class="title">Procedure</h3>
<p class="noindent">Steps of procedure:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p class="">Wear mask and wash hands.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="italic">Purpose:</span> To prevent cross infection.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Open the sterile tray and spread the sterile towel around the wound.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="italic">Purpose:</span> To create a sterile field around the wound and to minimize the wound of contamination.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Control the hemorrhage either by exerting pressure on the wound or by applying hemostats on the bleeding vessels.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="italic">Purpose:</span> Checking hemorrhage is necessary to prevent shock and also to prevent complications later (e.g., hematoma)</p></li>
<li><p class="">Prepare to anesthetize the wound edges. Take the local anesthetic in a small syringe. Insert a small gauge needle gently into the margin of the wound. Aspirate to prevent accidental injection of the anesthetic agent into the blood vessels. Inject the anesthetic slowly into the wound margins.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="italic">Purpose</span>: Accidental injection of anesthetics into the blood vessel can cause arrhythmias in the patient.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Clean the wound thoroughly with normal saline using a 20 mL syringe. Irrigate the wound with large amounts of normal saline solution to remove all foreign bodies lodged in the wound (cleaning may be done by using a bulb syringe or asepto syringe).</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="italic">Purpose:</span> Thorough cleaning of the wound helps to keep the wound clean and thus aids in the healing process.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Cleaning of the wound also facilitates thorough inspection of the wound for damage to the bones and tendons.</p>
<p class="indent">Using a sharp scissors or a scalpel, trim the ragged edges of the wounds and cut off the dead tissues, if any.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="italic">Purpose:</span> To provide straight edges so that the wound edges remain in apposition and healing will be promoted.</p>
<p class="indent">Dead tissues are devitalized tissues which will not help in the healing process.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Put on fresh sterile gloves and sterile drapes, if necessary.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="italic">Purpose:</span> To minimize wound contamination.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The wound margins are carefully brought together and the wound is closed layer by layer.</p>
<p class="indent">Round body needles and catgut are used for suturing the subcutaneous tissue. Cutting needles and nonabsorbable materials are used for the skin. Use interrupted sutures tied with a square knot. Sutures should be firm but not tied with excess tension.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="italic">Purpose:</span> Too tight knots will cause necrosis by cutting the blood supply. The knots will become tighter on the next day due to the formation of edema and the patient will complain of much pain.</p></li>

<div class="section" id="ch17lev2sec39"><h2 class="title">After Care of the Patient and the Article</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Following wound closure, clean the wound again and apply a multilayered dressing to absorb drainage and to arrest bleeding by exerting pressure.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Secure the dressings with a roller bandage or adhesive tapes. As far possible, avoid covering the wound area with adhesive straps, completely, because it may foster accumulation of moisture and subsequent maceration of the wound edges.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Keep the wound as dry as possible.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Remove the mackintosh and towel. Replace the bed linen. Change the garments if necessary. Make the patient comfortable by adjustable his position in bed.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Ask the patient to rest in bed to prevent fainting attacks.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Elevate the injured part above the heart level to minimize the edema and pain. Mild analgesics may be given to reduce pain.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Take all the articles to the utility room. Discard the soiled dressing and send for incineration. Wash and clean the articles first in the cold water and then with warm water and soap. Wash them thoroughly and dry them. Reset the suturing tray and send for autoclaving. Replace all articles to their proper places.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Wash hands. Record on the nurses record with date and time the type of the wound, the number of sutures applied, type of drainage tube applied, if any etc.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Return to the bedside to assess the comfort of the patient and to observe the condition of wound. Watch for any bleeding from the wound area. Change the dressing if there is an excessive bleeding. Report to the doctor.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Watch for the vital signs regularly to detect early signs of shock and collapse on the first day and signs of infection on subsequent days.<a name="page661"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">661</span></span></p></li>
<li><p class="">Unless signs of infection occur, the dressing should be left undisturbed until time for suture removal. Changing the dressing frequently causes friction on the wound edges and increases the possibility of the wound infection.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Inject tetanus toxoid, if it is not given previously.</p></li>
<li><p class="">On discharge of the patient, the patient should be given the instructions about the care of the wound, and the time when he has return for the removal of sutures.</p></li>

</div>
</div><div class="section" id="ch17lev1sec12"><h1 class="title">SURGICAL DRESSING</h1>
<p class="noindent">A dressing is a protective covering applied to a wound. The goal of a wound care is to promote tissue repair and regeneration, so that skin integrity is restored. Dressing is used as a protective cover over the wound which helps meet the goal of wound care. Most dressings especially for the surgical wounds consist of three layers. The dressings applied directly over the wound called contact layer, allows drainage to pass into the middle layer. This layer should be able to be removed without causing further tissue damage. This middle layer dressing absorbs the drainage and the outer layer keeps the two inner layers in place.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch17lev2sec40"><h2 class="title">Purposes of Dressing</h2>
<p class="noindent">There are many different types of dressings, but all have essentially the same purposes as follows:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p class="">Remove necrotic tissue</p></li>
<li><p class="">Prevent, eliminate, or control infection</p></li>
<li><p class="">Absorb drainage of discharge</p></li>
<li><p class="">Control bleeding</p></li>
<li><p class="">Apply medication</p></li>
<li><p class="">Maintain a moist wound environment</p></li>
<li><p class="">Promote quick healing</p></li>
<li><p class="">Provide comfort</p></li>
<li><p class="">Protect the wound from further injury</p></li>
<li><p class="">Protect the skin surrounding the wound</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch17lev2sec41"><h2 class="title">Advantages of Dressings</h2>
<p class="noindent">The advantages of wound dressing are as follows:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Dressings absorb drainage to help promote wound healing</p></li>
<li><p class="">Dressings protect the wound from mechanical injury</p></li>
<li><p class="">Dressings when used as a pressure dressing or with elastic bandages promote homeostasis help prevent hemorrhage, and aid in wound edge approximation</p></li>
<li><p class="">Dressing splint or immobilize the wound, facilitating healing and preventing further trauma</p></li>
<li><p class="">Dressings prevent contamination from the external environment</p></li>
<li><p class="">Dressings provide physical, psychological and esthetic comfort.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">The nurse prepares the client for the dressing change by explaining what will be done before starting the procedure. Proper screening is used to provide privacy. The client is assisted to a position that is comfortable and also convenient for the person changing the dressing. The area is exposed while maintaining proper draping. It is important to use appropriate aseptic techniques when changing the dressings to prevent nosocomial infections.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch17lev2sec42"><h2 class="title">Purposes of an Effective Dressing</h2>
<p class="noindent">As stated earlier, a dressing is applied to a wound for one or more of the following reasons:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">To provide a proper environment for wound healing.</p></li>
<li><p class="">To absorb drainage.</p></li>
<li><p class="">To splint or immobilize the wound.</p></li>
<li><p class="">To protect the wound and new epithelial tissue from mechanical injury.</p></li>
<li><p class="">To protect the wound from bacterial contamination and from soiling by feces, vomitus, and urine.</p></li>
<li><p class="">To promote hemostasis, as in a pressure dressing, and</p></li>
<li><p class="">To provide mental and physical comfort for the patient.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">In some instances, dressings are eliminated during the immediate postoperative period. Examples, of circumstances in which dressings are not necessary, are facial lacerations, pedicle flaps, or skin grafts on a smooth surface.</p>
<p class="indent">When the initial dressing on a clean, dry incision is removed, often it is not replaced. Generally, initial dressings on clean, dry incisions are left in place until the wound edges are sealed and the wound is healing (usually 24 hours).</p>
<p class="noindent"><bold>The advantages of not using any dressings include the following:</bold></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">The conditions that promote growth of organisms (warmth, moisture, and darkness) are eliminated.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The wound can be readily observed.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Bathing is easier.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Reactions to tape are avoided.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Patient's comfort and activity are increased.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Costs for dressings are reduced, and</p></li>
<li><p class="">Psychological impact of the surgical incision is reduced.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch17lev2sec43"><h2 class="title">General Instructions</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">The procedure of changing dressings, examining and closing the wound, uses principles of asepsis.</p></li>

</ul>
<p class="indent">The suture line is cleansed before and after suture removal.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">While removing interrupted sutures, alternate ones are removed first. The remaining sutures are removed a day or two later. If wound dehiscence occurs, the remaining sutures may then be left in place.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Suture material that is beneath the skin is considered free from bacteria, and those visible outside is in contact with the resident bacteria of the skin. It is important that no part of the stitch which is above the skin level enter and contaminate the tissues under the skin.<a name="page665"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">665</span></span></p></li>
<li><p class="">Suture material left beneath the skin acts as a foreign body and elicits the inflammatory response. While removing sutures, care to be taken to remove them completely. Each suture should be examined for its completeness. Every interrupted suture will have one knot and four ends when removed completely. The number of sutures should be counted before and after removal.</p></li>
<li><p class="">If wound dehiscence occurs during the removal of the sutures, inform the surgeon immediately. In case of abdominal wounds, resuturing is imperative to prevent evisceration. In other places, if resuturing is not necessary, adhesive tapes should be applied to approximate the wound edges as closely as possible.</p></li>
<li><p class="">After the removal of sutures, even if the wound is dry, a small dressing is applied for a day or two to prevent infection. The patient should be told about the care of the wound. He is advised to take rest after removal of sutures of an abdominal wound. The patient should be told not to strain the part, e.g., not to cough or lift heavy weight after removal of sutures from the abdomen. This will prevent wound dehiscence.</p></li>
<li><p class="">If wound discharge occurs, the patient should be instructed to contact the surgeon. Presence of pain and swelling at the wound line are the signs of complications.</p></li>

<p class="indent">In the first case the drain is removed when drainage has become negligible or has ceased. This is often within 1–3 days.</p>
<p class="indent">In the second case, the drain is removed once the danger of leakage has passed. This is usually 4–5 days.</p>
<p class="indent">The drain is usually brought out through a small incision separate from the main wound, to avoid both—interference with healing and contamination of the wound. Sometimes it is brought out through the wound, while in certain circumstances the wound itself requires drainage.</p>
<p class="indent">Wherever a drain is inserted it should be covered with a sterile dressing or, if a tube, its exit from the skin is surrounded with such a dressing.</p>

<div class="section" id="ch17lev2sec61"><h2 class="title">Wound Drainage</h2>
<p class="noindent">After surgery, some patients require wound drains, such as the one pictured above. The wound drain is inserted while the patient is in the operating room receiving general anesthesia. The purpose of the drain is to remove fluid and/or blood from the surgical site. This helps the healing process. Not all patients need wound drains following surgery. Wound drains are usually made of plastic. One end is placed within the wound to be drained and the other end is connected to a suction collection device. The fluid may be collected in a drainage bag, plastic bulb, and plastic carton or onto a dressing.</p>

<p class="noindent">The nature and quantity of drainage should be carefully noted. The quantity of fluid draining can be measured accurately if it is collected into a bag or suction apparatus. This should be recorded every 24 hours or more frequently, if there is a large quantity. Some surgeons advocate that drains should be shortened gradually by pulling them out a little and cutting off the excess, so that the drainage track can heal from the bottom, and that tube drains should be rotated so that they do not adhere to the tissues. However, many simply remove the drain when it has ceased to fulfill a useful function <bold>(<a href="#ch17fig30" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 17.30</a>)</bold>.</p>

<p class="noindent">Perioperative nurses provide for the surgical patient's needs, by assessing, planning and implementing nursing care patient receives preoperatively, intraoperatively, and postoperatively. Nursing activities performed by the perioperative nurse include patient assessment, creating and maintaining a sterile and safe environment, preoperative and postoperative teaching, monitoring physiologic and psychological status, integration and coordination of care across settings and among disciplines, patient advocacy, and efficient provision of resources. Surgery is described as the treatment of diseases, injury or deformity by a manual or instrumental procedure. Different nurses care the surgical client during each phase of surgical experience. The nurse's major responsibility is to provide safe, consistent and effective nursing care during each phase of surgery. Preoperative phase begins when the client decides to have surgery and ends when the client is transferred to the operating room. Intraoperative phase begins when the client is transferred to the operating room and ends when the client is admitted to the post-anesthesia room. Operating room nurses required special abilities to take responsibilities with the emergencies of their different roles like scrubbing up nurse, circulatory nurse, etc., postoperative phase begins with the transfer of the client to the post-anesthesia room/postoperative ward and ends with the discharge of the client from the hospital or facility providing continuing care.</p>
