<p class="indent">Fundamentals of Nursing are the foundation for all budding nurses. Nursing is the art and science that involves caring for individuals, families, and communities to promote wellness and wholeness. Nursing Foundation forms the underlying basis for providing nursing care to individuals in all stages of development. It teaches basic theoretical and practical knowledge of nursing under supervised medical settings. The scope of nursing practice encompasses the range of roles, functions, responsibilities, and activities that a registered nurse is educated, competent, and authorized to perform.</p>
<p class="indent">Learning nursing fundamentals will help all student nurses interact with future patients properly and effectively, minimizing the chances of medical negligence. Nursing foundation is about learning, understanding, and practicing the primary day-to-day duties that every nurse is expected to perform, as well as developing basic skills to diagnose, assess, and treat future patients effectively. As a nurse educator, I take the responsibility to impart knowledge on nursing foundation by presenting this textbook to the budding student nurses.</p>
<p class="indent">This book includes review questions and multiple choice questions (MCQs) with answers that will stimulate learning interest after reading the content of each chapter. I am sure that whoever reads this textbook will definitely gain adequate knowledge and achieve a good score in examinations.</p>
<p class="noindent">I wish the entire nursing community to cherish this book.</p>
