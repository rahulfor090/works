First, there are honourable exceptions to the generalization, such as the late Professor A.S. Paintal. Secondly, an experienced scientist can continue to encourage young people towards good work, provided he understands his strengths and limitations. Thirdly, the optimum age differs for different activities. Statistically speaking, the best scientific writing is usually done in the forties, whereas masterpieces of literature and poetry are created still later. Finally, the agenda of life is not over with good research and writing. For spiritual growth, circumstances become more favourable when the capacity for worldly achievements starts dwindling.</div></li><li class="row" id="d1e1231"><div class="fn-label cell"><sup>[<a href="#ch3fn1">2</a>]</sup></div><div class="fn-content cell"><sup>1</sup>Here treatment does not mean medical or surgical treatment; it simply means an intervention introduced by the investigator.</div></li><li class="row" id="d1e1238"><div class="fn-label cell"><sup>[<a href="#ch3fn2">3</a>]</sup></div><div class="fn-content cell"><sup>2</sup>Usually the minimum number of subjects required is decided on the basis of power analysis.

Statistical power analysis exploits the relationship among the four variables involved in statistical inference: (1) sample size (n), (2) significance criterion, (3) population effect size, and (4) statistical power.</div></li><li class="row" id="d1e1825"><div class="fn-label cell"><sup>[<a href="#ch4fn1">4</a>]</sup></div><div class="fn-content cell"><sup>1</sup> It may be unethical even in human experiments.

It had earlier been mentioned that the ± sign is also used between the mean and SD. To avoid the confusion, a recent trend is to use the ± sign only to denote a range, because that is what is mathematically true. Mean and SD are expressed by writing the SD in brackets immediately after the mean. For example, if the mean is 28 and the SD 5.7, it is written as 28 (5.7).</div></li><li class="row" id="d1e4383"><div class="fn-label cell"><sup>[<a href="#ch6fn1">12</a>]</sup></div><div class="fn-content cell"><sup>1</sup> Here the word ‘treatment’ has been used in a statistical sense, not clinical sense. Statistically speaking, whatever is done with each group is the treatment given to the group. Thus, even if the control group receives no medicine, etc., and is just observed, ‘no treatment’ (clinical) becomes the ‘treatment’ (statistical) given to the control group.</div></li><li class="row" id="d1e4448"><div class="fn-label cell"><sup>[<a href="#ch6fn2">13</a>]</sup></div><div class="fn-content cell"><sup>2</sup> Because after eliminating the drop-outs during the run-in period we are more sure of the subjects available for the study.</div></li><li class="row" id="d1e4530"><div class="fn-label cell"><sup>[<a href="#ch6fn3">14</a>]</sup></div><div class="fn-content cell"><sup>3</sup> Effectiveness is different from efficacy. Effectiveness refers to the actual usefulness of the treatment under usual conditions. Efficacy refers to the possible value of the treatment under ideal conditions.</div></li><li class="row" id="d1e4681"><div class="fn-label cell"><sup>[<a href="#ch6fn4">15</a>]</sup></div><div class="fn-content cell"><sup>4</sup> It is easy to understand why serious adverse reactions to the treatment under trial require premature closure of the study. But even dramatic efficacy calls for the same. Occasionally, the treatment is so effective that in spite of masking it is easy to make out the difference between the control and experimental group. In these circumstances the code is broken prematurely, results analyzed, and if the impression of remarkable efficacy is confirmed by statistical analysis, the trial is closed. Apart from savings in time, money and effort, there is an important ethical reason for doing so. Further prolongation of the trial needlessly deprives the society of a useful remedy till the trial is closed. A classical recent example of this type is the trial of low doses of aspirin for preventing myocardial events. The trial was closed prematurely because the benefits were too clear to be ignored. However, later it has come to light that while aspirin prevents myocardial events, it may increase the risk for cerebral events.</div></li><li class="row" id="d1e5844"><div class="fn-label cell"><sup>[<a href="#ch7fn1">16</a>]</sup></div><div class="fn-content cell"><sup>1</sup>In contrast, making a specific prediction about death might accelerate the process of dying: this has been termed the nocebo effect.</div></li><li class="row" id="d1e5937"><div class="fn-label cell"><sup>[<a href="#ch7fn2">17</a>]</sup></div><div class="fn-content cell"><sup>2</sup>1966 is a popular choice because MEDLINE goes only that far back.</div></li><li class="row" id="d1e5944"><div class="fn-label cell"><sup>[<a href="#ch7fn3">18</a>]</sup></div><div class="fn-content cell"><sup>3</sup>This can affect the conclusions.

For example, good quality studies are consistent in concluding that physical inactivity predisposes a person to coronary heart disease (relative risk, 1.2-3.1), whereas poor quality studies give highly variable results (relative risk, 0.5-2.5) (Petiti 2000, p.258).</div></li><li class="row" id="d1e5958"><div class="fn-label cell"><sup>[<a href="#ch7fn5">20</a>]</sup></div><div class="fn-content cell"><sup>5</sup>Including abstracts etc. reduces publication bias in the systematic review.

Let us examine how the textbook descriptions of the clinical manifestations of various diseases have evolved. To start with, we have descriptions based on the observations of one or more perceptive physicians. The clinical features which occur most frequently in these descriptions form the basis of the textbook description. This is qualitative research.</div>
<div class="fn-content cell">On the other hand, the social sciences, in order to assert their scientific character, also tried to use objective, verifiable quantitative methods. Today, in social sciences also, the use of qualitative methods is less common than that of quantitative methods.</div></li><li class="row" id="d1e7104"><div class="fn-label cell"><sup>[<a href="#ch10fn3">25</a>]</sup></div><div class="fn-content cell"><sup>3</sup>There is subjectivity also at the level of the consumer of research, or the reader of the research report.

Therefore, it is best to write them quickly and get them out of the way. Third, once these sections have been written, they can be given to the guide. He may advise further analysis of results from a different angle, or even a few additional experiments. Therefore, the sooner these sections are given to the guide, the easier it is to meet the deadline for the thesis.

<p><span class="italic">Full many a flower is born to blush unseen</span></p>
<p><span class="italic">And waste its sweetness on desert air</span></p>
<p><span class="italic">— THOMAS GRAY</span></p>
<p>Shri Madhaw Das Bijlani was a self-made man who did not know when he was born, and did not care about it. When he was barely five, his father passed away leaving behind an illiterate widow, and three children – Madhaw, his elder sister and his younger brother. Forced by circumstances to leave school and start earning when he was still in his early teens, he continued to learn, initially with the help of a Gandhian cousin, and then on his own. The result was that without having even a school leaving certificate, he could have easily beaten an average graduate and many postgraduates so far as command over the English language goes. He never really stopped learning. He read slowly but thoroughly, made sure that he understood every word – may be with the help of a dictionary, and appreciated an elegant expression, going over it again and again to enjoy its beauty and charm. His handwriting was almost like calligraphy, and his grammar was near-perfect. His enterprising nature made it difficult for him to stick to one business for very long, and through sheer hard work, he made a success of whatever he decided to do. Some of the most cherished years of his life were spent as a medical representative with Unichem, and later as a manufacturing chemist in Karachi. This brought him in contact with doctors, and created in him a strong ambition that his children should be doctors. God helps those who help themselves: both his sons became doctors, and got married to doctors, with the result that he became the proud father of four doctors.</p>
<p>Age had dulled neither his inquisitiveness nor his sensitivity, and I wonder how much of it was due to lack of formal education. He retained a child-like simplicity, curiosity and sense of wonder till the very end of his life. He had a great talent for innovation and improvisation. Had his <a name="page8"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">8</span></span>circumstances been more favourable, he could have become a great scientist. His qualities of the heart were no less remarkable than those of the head. Ever considerate to the less fortunate, he had a knack for spotting people he could possibly help; even those whom he scarcely knew. During his morning and evening walks he would help a blind person cross the road, or a labourer push his load.</p>
<p>He had a philosophical bent of mind, and cherished some perennial values such as truth, honesty and dignity of labour. He was ethical without being ritualistic, was above caste and creed, and was sensitive to injustice and falsehood. Age had not immunized him to the ills of the society – he could not accept with equanimity corruption, neglect of duty, environmental pollution, sex and violence on the TV, and chaotic traffic.</p>
<p>He voluntarily lived a life much simpler than he could afford, and enjoyed it. He ate simple wholesome food, took regular exercise, and looked after his body well. Till his last day, he walked erect, and nobody could have anticipated his end. Possibly as a reward for the way he had lived, God gave him a swift and painless death on 4 November 1996 at the age of about 75. The last thing that he did was to donate his eyes, so that somebody would be able to see once again. He left for his heavenly abode with a sense of fulfillment, and without the burden of unfinished responsibilities. The way he left us reminds me of what Charlotte Bronte said about her sister Emily: “Never in all her life had she lingered over any task that lay before her, and she did not linger now. She sank rapidly. She made haste to leave us”.<a name="page9"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">9</span></span></p>

First, there are honourable exceptions to the generalization, such as the late Professor A.S. Paintal. Secondly, an experienced scientist can continue to encourage young people towards good work, provided he understands his strengths and limitations. Thirdly, the optimum age differs for different activities. Statistically speaking, the best scientific writing is usually done in the forties, whereas masterpieces of literature and poetry are created still later. Finally, the agenda of life is not over with good research and writing.

But even dramatic efficacy calls for the same. Occasionally, the treatment is so effective that in spite of masking it is easy to make out the difference between the control and experimental group. In these circumstances the code is broken prematurely, results analyzed, and if the impression of remarkable efficacy is confirmed by statistical analysis, the trial is closed. Apart from savings in time, money and effort, there is an important ethical reason for doing so. Further prolongation of the trial needlessly deprives the society of a useful remedy till the trial is closed. A classical recent example of this type is the trial of low doses of aspirin for preventing myocardial events. The trial was closed prematurely because the benefits were too clear to be ignored. However, later it has come to light that while aspirin prevents myocardial events, it may increase the risk for cerebral events.</div></li><li class="row" id="d1e5844"><div class="fn-label cell"><sup>[<a href="#ch7fn1">16</a>]</sup></div><div class="fn-content cell"><sup>1</sup>In contrast, making a specific prediction about death might accelerate the process of dying: this has been termed the nocebo effect.</div></li><li class="row" id="d1e5937"><div class="fn-label cell"><sup>[<a href="#ch7fn2">17</a>]</sup></div><div class="fn-content cell"><sup>2</sup>1966 is a popular choice because MEDLINE goes only that far back.</div></li><li class="row" id="d1e5944"><div class="fn-label cell"><sup>[<a href="#ch7fn3">18</a>]</sup></div><div class="fn-content cell"><sup>3</sup>This can affect the conclusions.

He was an ardent devotee of Sri Aurobindo and the Mother, and they had revealed to him the inner meaning of their works as well as given him remarkable ability to put it across. As their untiring ambassador, he travelled extensively, disseminating their philosophy and vision in his inimitably clear style and resonant voice, laced with wit and humour. He was on a spiritual quest while also being a householder, which is always a formidable undertaking. He served the Mother till the last breath, and breathed his last in Her lap in Pondicherry on 23 September 2007.<a name="page10"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">10</span></span></p>

First, there are honourable exceptions to the generalization, such as the late Professor A.S. Paintal. Secondly, an experienced scientist can continue to encourage young people towards good work, provided he understands his strengths and limitations. Thirdly, the optimum age differs for different activities. Statistically speaking, the best scientific writing is usually done in the forties, whereas masterpieces of literature and poetry are created still later. Finally, the agenda of life is not over with good research and writing. For spiritual growth, circumstances become more favourable when the capacity for worldly achievements starts dwindling.</div></li><li class="row" id="d1e1231"><div class="fn-label cell"><sup>[<a href="#ch3fn1">2</a>]</sup></div><div class="fn-content cell"><sup>1</sup>Here treatment does not mean medical or surgical treatment; it simply means an intervention introduced by the investigator.</div></li><li class="row" id="d1e1238"><div class="fn-label cell"><sup>[<a href="#ch3fn2">3</a>]</sup></div><div class="fn-content cell"><sup>2</sup>Usually the minimum number of subjects required is decided on the basis of power analysis.

It had earlier been mentioned that the ± sign is also used between the mean and SD. To avoid the confusion, a recent trend is to use the ± sign only to denote a range, because that is what is mathematically true. Mean and SD are expressed by writing the SD in brackets immediately after the mean. For example, if the mean is 28 and the SD 5.7, it is written as 28 (5.7).</div></li><li class="row" id="d1e4383"><div class="fn-label cell"><sup>[<a href="#ch6fn1">12</a>]</sup></div><div class="fn-content cell"><sup>1</sup> Here the word ‘treatment’ has been used in a statistical sense, not clinical sense. Statistically speaking, whatever is done with each group is the treatment given to the group. Thus, even if the control group receives no medicine, etc., and is just observed, ‘no treatment’ (clinical) becomes the ‘treatment’ (statistical) given to the control group.</div></li><li class="row" id="d1e4448"><div class="fn-label cell"><sup>[<a href="#ch6fn2">13</a>]</sup></div><div class="fn-content cell"><sup>2</sup> Because after eliminating the drop-outs during the run-in period we are more sure of the subjects available for the study.</div></li><li class="row" id="d1e4530"><div class="fn-label cell"><sup>[<a href="#ch6fn3">14</a>]</sup></div><div class="fn-content cell"><sup>3</sup> Effectiveness is different from efficacy.

But even dramatic efficacy calls for the same. Occasionally, the treatment is so effective that in spite of masking it is easy to make out the difference between the control and experimental group. In these circumstances the code is broken prematurely, results analyzed, and if the impression of remarkable efficacy is confirmed by statistical analysis, the trial is closed. Apart from savings in time, money and effort, there is an important ethical reason for doing so. Further prolongation of the trial needlessly deprives the society of a useful remedy till the trial is closed. A classical recent example of this type is the trial of low doses of aspirin for preventing myocardial events. The trial was closed prematurely because the benefits were too clear to be ignored. However, later it has come to light that while aspirin prevents myocardial events, it may increase the risk for cerebral events.</div></li><li class="row" id="d1e5844"><div class="fn-label cell"><sup>[<a href="#ch7fn1">16</a>]</sup></div><div class="fn-content cell"><sup>1</sup>In contrast, making a specific prediction about death might accelerate the process of dying: this has been termed the nocebo effect.</div></li><li class="row" id="d1e5937"><div class="fn-label cell"><sup>[<a href="#ch7fn2">17</a>]</sup></div><div class="fn-content cell"><sup>2</sup>1966 is a popular choice because MEDLINE goes only that far back.</div></li><li class="row" id="d1e5944"><div class="fn-label cell"><sup>[<a href="#ch7fn3">18</a>]</sup></div><div class="fn-content cell"><sup>3</sup>This can affect the conclusions.

<p><span class="italic">— CHARAKA</span></p>
<p>Research provides a means to enhance one's knowledge, to broaden one's intellectual horizon, to satisfy one's curiosity, to provide objective basis for one's professional activity, to develop new techniques and technologies to solve unresolved problems, to encourage self-reliance and confidence, and on a more philosophical level a path to search for truth.</p>
<p>Research promotes a sense of enquiry and scientific temper, inculcates a discipline for scientific rigor, encourages objectivity and humility, fosters self confidence and can be a source of immense happiness. Millennia ago Socrates exhorted, “To live on the ideas of others is a sickness”. And nearer home the angel saint of Indian Science, Shri Jawaharlal Nehru, reminded us, “Always we must hold to our anchor of precise knowledge, tested by reason and <span class="italic">even more by experiments</span> and practice”.</p>
<p>The second half of the twentieth century made revolutionary changes in the practice of medicine not only through introduction of advances in new techniques and technologies but even more so by emphasis on evidence based medicine, thus highlighting the need for research.</p>
<p>It is generally recognized that India has made creditable progress in the practice of medicine but it has miserably lagged behind in the field of biomedical research. At the same time there are numerous problems that bedevil the health of the nation, for which we alone have to find solutions; others are obviously not interested in them. An estimated 93 percent of World's burden of preventable mortality (measured in years of potential life lost) occurs in the developing world. Today less than 10 percent of global research and development budget is used to address <a name="page12"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">12</span></span>the largest disease burden, which is found among the poorer populations of the World.</p>
<p>Burdened with a heavy load of clinical work, not provided with basic training in research methodology, paucity of adequate infrastructure and scientific environment and consequent lack of mentorship for research, the teachers in our medical colleges are often blamed for our poor scientific contribution.</p>
<p>Prof. Bijlani deserves our gratitude for producing this comprehensive book on Medical Research to address the existing lacunae in our medical education. He has provided a systematic account of the various steps involved in medical research and made this interesting by simple, practical examples, questions and answers, illustrative cartoons, thought promoting quotations and relevant references for further reading.</p>
<p>Though modestly recommended by him as a work for beginners, I must confess that it had valuable information even for individuals like me who have devoted a lifetime to practice and promotion of biomedical research. I strongly recommend that it should be made a compulsory part of the curriculum, if not for undergraduates, at least for postgraduate students.</p>

Thirdly, the optimum age differs for different activities. Statistically speaking, the best scientific writing is usually done in the forties, whereas masterpieces of literature and poetry are created still later. Finally, the agenda of life is not over with good research and writing.

It had earlier been mentioned that the ± sign is also used between the mean and SD. To avoid the confusion, a recent trend is to use the ± sign only to denote a range, because that is what is mathematically true. Mean and SD are expressed by writing the SD in brackets immediately after the mean. For example, if the mean is 28 and the SD 5.7, it is written as 28 (5.7).</div></li><li class="row" id="d1e4383"><div class="fn-label cell"><sup>[<a href="#ch6fn1">12</a>]</sup></div><div class="fn-content cell"><sup>1</sup> Here the word ‘treatment’ has been used in a statistical sense, not clinical sense. Statistically speaking, whatever is done with each group is the treatment given to the group. Thus, even if the control group receives no medicine, etc., and is just observed, ‘no treatment’ (clinical) becomes the ‘treatment’ (statistical) given to the control group.</div></li><li class="row" id="d1e4448"><div class="fn-label cell"><sup>[<a href="#ch6fn2">13</a>]</sup></div><div class="fn-content cell"><sup>2</sup> Because after eliminating the drop-outs during the run-in period we are more sure of the subjects available for the study.</div></li><li class="row" id="d1e4530"><div class="fn-label cell"><sup>[<a href="#ch6fn3">14</a>]</sup></div><div class="fn-content cell"><sup>3</sup> Effectiveness is different from efficacy.

But even dramatic efficacy calls for the same. Occasionally, the treatment is so effective that in spite of masking it is easy to make out the difference between the control and experimental group. In these circumstances the code is broken prematurely, results analyzed, and if the impression of remarkable efficacy is confirmed by statistical analysis, the trial is closed. Apart from savings in time, money and effort, there is an important ethical reason for doing so. Further prolongation of the trial needlessly deprives the society of a useful remedy till the trial is closed. A classical recent example of this type is the trial of low doses of aspirin for preventing myocardial events. The trial was closed prematurely because the benefits were too clear to be ignored. However, later it has come to light that while aspirin prevents myocardial events, it may increase the risk for cerebral events.</div></li><li class="row" id="d1e5844"><div class="fn-label cell"><sup>[<a href="#ch7fn1">16</a>]</sup></div><div class="fn-content cell"><sup>1</sup>In contrast, making a specific prediction about death might accelerate the process of dying: this has been termed the nocebo effect.</div></li><li class="row" id="d1e5937"><div class="fn-label cell"><sup>[<a href="#ch7fn2">17</a>]</sup></div><div class="fn-content cell"><sup>2</sup>1966 is a popular choice because MEDLINE goes only that far back.</div></li><li class="row" id="d1e5944"><div class="fn-label cell"><sup>[<a href="#ch7fn3">18</a>]</sup></div><div class="fn-content cell"><sup>3</sup>This can affect the conclusions.

<p>Medical doctors in India join postgraduate courses with little more than a vague idea about the method of going about research. During the three years that they spend as postgraduates, they do some research for their thesis, and in the process pick up also something about the process of research. That, in a way, is the best way to learn research methodology – just as the best way to learn swimming is to get thrown into the water. However, some theoretical knowledge may encourage the beginner to jump into the water and also avoid some fatal mistakes.</p>
<p>If the only aim of this book were to guide postgraduate students in their thesis work, one-third of the book may not be necessary. However, this apparent redundancy also has a two-fold purpose. Firstly, although most of the work involved in research is sheer drudgery, there is in it also a romantic element – enough of it to serve as compensation and justification for all the drudgery. The book is an introduction not just to the mechanical and repetitive aspects of research but also to its romantic side. Secondly, it is a sad truth that the quality of medical research in India leaves much to be desired. This book is designed to make a humble contribution towards improving the quality of our research by inspiring the readers to select better questions for research and to go about addressing the questions in the best possible way. Improving the quality of research is more a question of attitude than hard work: the amount of work required for doing mediocre research is exactly the same as that for the best of research. It is hoped that the ‘adiposity’ of the book will enlighten realism with romance, and immunize the reader against the temptations of mediocrity.</p>

First, there are honourable exceptions to the generalization, such as the late Professor A.S. Paintal. Secondly, an experienced scientist can continue to encourage young people towards good work, provided he understands his strengths and limitations. Thirdly, the optimum age differs for different activities. Statistically speaking, the best scientific writing is usually done in the forties, whereas masterpieces of literature and poetry are created still later. Finally, the agenda of life is not over with good research and writing. For spiritual growth, circumstances become more favourable when the capacity for worldly achievements starts dwindling.</div></li><li class="row" id="d1e1231"><div class="fn-label cell"><sup>[<a href="#ch3fn1">2</a>]</sup></div><div class="fn-content cell"><sup>1</sup>Here treatment does not mean medical or surgical treatment; it simply means an intervention introduced by the investigator.</div></li><li class="row" id="d1e1238"><div class="fn-label cell"><sup>[<a href="#ch3fn2">3</a>]</sup></div><div class="fn-content cell"><sup>2</sup>Usually the minimum number of subjects required is decided on the basis of power analysis.

It had earlier been mentioned that the ± sign is also used between the mean and SD. To avoid the confusion, a recent trend is to use the ± sign only to denote a range, because that is what is mathematically true. Mean and SD are expressed by writing the SD in brackets immediately after the mean. For example, if the mean is 28 and the SD 5.7, it is written as 28 (5.7).</div></li><li class="row" id="d1e4383"><div class="fn-label cell"><sup>[<a href="#ch6fn1">12</a>]</sup></div><div class="fn-content cell"><sup>1</sup> Here the word ‘treatment’ has been used in a statistical sense, not clinical sense. Statistically speaking, whatever is done with each group is the treatment given to the group. Thus, even if the control group receives no medicine, etc., and is just observed, ‘no treatment’ (clinical) becomes the ‘treatment’ (statistical) given to the control group.</div></li><li class="row" id="d1e4448"><div class="fn-label cell"><sup>[<a href="#ch6fn2">13</a>]</sup></div><div class="fn-content cell"><sup>2</sup> Because after eliminating the drop-outs during the run-in period we are more sure of the subjects available for the study.</div></li><li class="row" id="d1e4530"><div class="fn-label cell"><sup>[<a href="#ch6fn3">14</a>]</sup></div><div class="fn-content cell"><sup>3</sup> Effectiveness is different from efficacy.

But even dramatic efficacy calls for the same. Occasionally, the treatment is so effective that in spite of masking it is easy to make out the difference between the control and experimental group. In these circumstances the code is broken prematurely, results analyzed, and if the impression of remarkable efficacy is confirmed by statistical analysis, the trial is closed. Apart from savings in time, money and effort, there is an important ethical reason for doing so. Further prolongation of the trial needlessly deprives the society of a useful remedy till the trial is closed. A classical recent example of this type is the trial of low doses of aspirin for preventing myocardial events. The trial was closed prematurely because the benefits were too clear to be ignored. However, later it has come to light that while aspirin prevents myocardial events, it may increase the risk for cerebral events.</div></li><li class="row" id="d1e5844"><div class="fn-label cell"><sup>[<a href="#ch7fn1">16</a>]</sup></div><div class="fn-content cell"><sup>1</sup>In contrast, making a specific prediction about death might accelerate the process of dying: this has been termed the nocebo effect.</div></li><li class="row" id="d1e5937"><div class="fn-label cell"><sup>[<a href="#ch7fn2">17</a>]</sup></div><div class="fn-content cell"><sup>2</sup>1966 is a popular choice because MEDLINE goes only that far back.</div></li><li class="row" id="d1e5944"><div class="fn-label cell"><sup>[<a href="#ch7fn3">18</a>]</sup></div><div class="fn-content cell"><sup>3</sup>This can affect the conclusions.

<p>A book like this one is, to some extent, like a book on cookery. Very few of the recipes can be truly original, but by the time they get into the book, the author has internalized them, lent them her personal touch, and treats them as her own recipes. Because of this process of picking up and internalizing which has been going on in my case for more than 35 years, it is difficult for me to thank, by name, each individual who has made some contribution to the book. However, a few individuals stand out, and it is my privilege to have this opportunity to express my gratitude to them.</p>
<p>First and foremost, among the several teachers who kindled in me the spark of disciplined and creative curiosity, two stand out – one, Dr. Virendra Kumar, who formally taught me Botany in the Pre-Medical Class (equivalent to today's Class XII), and two, Professor N.K. Bhide, who taught me Pharmacology during the MBBS course. It was their ‘stray’ remarks at appropriate and opportune moments during their classes which served as my introduction to the philosophy of science. Professor Bhide also passed on to me a treasure of rare books and articles which he had collected over decades.</p>
<p>I have had the good fortune of getting younger colleagues whom I could approach freely while preparing this book. They were extremely generous in giving me their time as well as reference material which have enriched this book. Among those whom I distinctly remember are Dr. N.K. Arora, Professor of Pediatrics at All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) (<a href="/9788184484175/chapter/ch6" class="ulink-exter">Chapter 6</a>), Dr. C.S. Pandav, Professor of Community Medicine at AIIMS (<a href="/9788184484175/chapter/ch6" class="ulink-exter">Chapters 6</a> and <a href="/9788184484175/chapter/ch7" class="ulink-exter">7</a>), Dr. R.M. Pandey, Professor of Biostatistics at AIIMS (<a href="/9788184484175/chapter/ch6" class="ulink-exter">Chapters 6</a> and <a href="/9788184484175/chapter/ch7" class="ulink-exter">7</a>), and Dr. D. Ghosh, Professor of Physiology (<a href="/9788184484175/chapter/ch9" class="ulink-exter">Chapter 9</a>). If in spite of their inputs, there are any errors or shortcomings in the book, the responsibility is entirely mine.</p>
<p>Professor Mangesh Nadkarni, a Professor of English and a scholar and writer himself, went through several chapters of the book, and made those small changes which make a big difference to the ease with which the book can be read. Further, I benefited a lot from his talks and <a name="page16"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">16</span></span>articles while writing <a href="/9788184484175/chapter/ch19" class="ulink-exter">Chapter 19</a>. Professor Makarand Paranjape, another reputed scholar, writer and poet, gave me the opportunity to reflect on the subject of science and spirituality by asking me to speak at one of his conferences. This exercise made it easy to add <a href="/9788184484175/chapter/ch20" class="ulink-exter">Chapter 20</a> to the book.</p>
<p>I am indebted to Professor P.N. Tandon, a renowned neurosurgeon and one of my favourite teachers, for agreeing to glance through the manuscript and writing a foreword.</p>
<p>The cartoons which have added spice and humour to the book have been collected from a variety of sources; the sources have been acknowledged individually.</p>
<p>The manuscript was typed cheerfully and promptly by Mr. Satish Sachdeva when I was at AIIMS, and by Mr. D.K. Singhal after I joined Sri Aurobindo Ashram – Delhi Branch. Dr. Ramaprabhu Vempati, a dear student of mine at AIIMS, drew the large number of figures which adorn <a href="/9788184484175/chapter/ch5" class="ulink-exter">Chapter 5</a> on the computer. In fact, whenever the preparation of the manuscript needed computer skills beyond my own, Dr. Ramaprabhu Vempati came to my rescue at AIIMS, and Mr. Mohan Lal at the Ashram. My daughter, Arpita, who as a psychologist has studied research methodology in great depth as a formal subject, also made significant contributions to several chapters. The drudgery of proof reading has been shared by my wife, Lovleen, who also made some good suggestions as we read the proofs.</p>
<p>My publishers, M/s Jaypee Brothers Medical Publishers, specially Shri J.P. Vij, Mr. Tarun Duneja and Ms. Bano deserve a special word of thanks for the infinite patience and understanding they have shown while waiting for and processing the manuscript.</p>
<p>I am quite sure there are many more who have contributed to the book in one way or the other; I apologize for having missed mentioning them by name.</p>

First, there are honourable exceptions to the generalization, such as the late Professor A.S. Paintal. Secondly, an experienced scientist can continue to encourage young people towards good work, provided he understands his strengths and limitations. Thirdly, the optimum age differs for different activities. Statistically speaking, the best scientific writing is usually done in the forties, whereas masterpieces of literature and poetry are created still later. Finally, the agenda of life is not over with good research and writing.

It had earlier been mentioned that the ± sign is also used between the mean and SD. To avoid the confusion, a recent trend is to use the ± sign only to denote a range, because that is what is mathematically true.

Statistically speaking, whatever is done with each group is the treatment given to the group. Thus, even if the control group receives no medicine, etc., and is just observed, ‘no treatment’ (clinical) becomes the ‘treatment’ (statistical) given to the control group.</div></li><li class="row" id="d1e4448"><div class="fn-label cell"><sup>[<a href="#ch6fn2">13</a>]</sup></div><div class="fn-content cell"><sup>2</sup> Because after eliminating the drop-outs during the run-in period we are more sure of the subjects available for the study.</div></li><li class="row" id="d1e4530"><div class="fn-label cell"><sup>[<a href="#ch6fn3">14</a>]</sup></div><div class="fn-content cell"><sup>3</sup> Effectiveness is different from efficacy.

But even dramatic efficacy calls for the same. Occasionally, the treatment is so effective that in spite of masking it is easy to make out the difference between the control and experimental group. In these circumstances the code is broken prematurely, results analyzed, and if the impression of remarkable efficacy is confirmed by statistical analysis, the trial is closed. Apart from savings in time, money and effort, there is an important ethical reason for doing so. Further prolongation of the trial needlessly deprives the society of a useful remedy till the trial is closed. A classical recent example of this type is the trial of low doses of aspirin for preventing myocardial events. The trial was closed prematurely because the benefits were too clear to be ignored. However, later it has come to light that while aspirin prevents myocardial events, it may increase the risk for cerebral events.</div></li><li class="row" id="d1e5844"><div class="fn-label cell"><sup>[<a href="#ch7fn1">16</a>]</sup></div><div class="fn-content cell"><sup>1</sup>In contrast, making a specific prediction about death might accelerate the process of dying: this has been termed the nocebo effect.</div></li><li class="row" id="d1e5937"><div class="fn-label cell"><sup>[<a href="#ch7fn2">17</a>]</sup></div><div class="fn-content cell"><sup>2</sup>1966 is a popular choice because MEDLINE goes only that far back.</div></li><li class="row" id="d1e5944"><div class="fn-label cell"><sup>[<a href="#ch7fn3">18</a>]</sup></div><div class="fn-content cell"><sup>3</sup>This can affect the conclusions.
