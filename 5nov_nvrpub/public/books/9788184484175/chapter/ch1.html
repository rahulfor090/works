The reason is that the brevity, precision and polish of a definition have a hypnotizing effect, all the more so if the definition is good. The hypnotic state leads to an uncritical acceptance of the definition on one hand, and on the other hand to an impression, often deceptive, that the term has been understood. Both these consequences are uneducational and highly anti-research. However, a book like this should begin with defining what research is. Therefore we will do the next best to not defining research at all: we will start with a few definitions of research and examine them critically.</p><p class="indent">The chapter-opening quote which defines research as ‘original and critical intellectual activity’ is extremely broad, and would cover almost all types of research, including that in subjects such as language, literature, history, geography or mathematics. Here ‘original’ refers to the fact that the question which the research seeks to answer is original. It should be original at least for the researcher; it need not be original for the world. It is difficult to have a question which nobody has thought of ever before. But so long as the researcher thought of the question independently, and investigated it personally, the work would be considered ‘original’. There are a few more definitions in the accompanying box. If you look at them critically, you will observe that research is essentially a serious and sustained attempt at answering questions. All questions do not lead to research; in fact the fate of most questions is to get consigned to oblivion. It is only when the question occurs to the right person at the right time under the right circumstances, and the person puts in the necessary time and effort to answer it, that we get a piece of research (<a href="#ch1fig1" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 1.1</a>).<a name="page2"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">2</span></span></p><div class="sidebar">
<h2 class="title">WHAT IS RESEARCH</h2>
<p class="noindent">Research is “the informed and disciplined gratification of curiosity”</p>
<p class="alignright"><span class="italic">JAY TEPPERMAN</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Research is systematic acquisition of new knowledge “which deeply satisfies both the explorer's adventurous spirit and his persistent curiosity”</p>

<p class="noindent">Research is “exploratory scholarship”</p>
<p class="alignright"><span class="italic">WALTER CANNON</span></p>
</div><p class="noindent">It is also important to point out that not all curiosity leads to research. There are many unhealthy and frivolous forms of curiosity which result in generation of only worthless information. As an extreme example, the grand old lady who keeps a tab on the affairs of all the young boys and girls of the town is certainly curious, but her efforts can hardly be called research.</p><p class="noindent">Although research is theoretically performed to look for answers to questions, in practice the scientist also has a hunch about the answer, and he secretly hopes that the research would confirm his convictions.</p><div class="figure" id="ch1fig1" data-label="Fig. 1.1"><div class="title"><span class="item-label">Fig. 1.1</span> The logo (designed by the author) of a symposium on research methodology organized at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in 1992. It shows the two key elements in the process of research: curiosity (indicated by the question mark), and complete and accurate observations (symbolized by the eye)</div><img alt="Fig. 1.1" src="/MediumImage/2-1.jpg"><div class="additional-markup"></div></div><p class="noindent"><a name="page3"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">3</span></span>If this irrational emotional factor gets translated only into passionate and enthusiastic involvement of the scientist in his work, it is perfectly legitimate. But the scientist should not allow his prejudice to cloud his observations. While making observations and analyzing the data, he should be consciously objective and detached, keeping in mind Peter Medawar's warning that the intensity of a conviction has no bearing on its truth.</p><div class="section" id="ch1lev1sec1"><h1 class="title">WHY RESEARCH</h1>
<p class="noindent">It is often loosely remarked that ‘re-search’ means searching again for what is already known, and therefore some people ask whether developing countries like India can afford such an expensive luxury. Further, it is pointed out that since the quality of our research leaves much to be desired, its contribution to knowledge is negligible. While these are strong arguments, it is also true that unless we encourage research today, even if it is mediocre, we cannot hope for better research tomorrow. The hope that some-sort-of-research today will lead to better research tomorrow is based on the intimate relationship between teaching and research. Teachers who are engaged in research make better teachers for a variety of reasons. First, they are better informed about the latest advances in their subject. Secondly, they encourage the students to ask questions. Finally, they are less dogmatic in their approach because they know that what they are teaching today may be obsolete tomorrow. Students taught by such teachers are likely to develop the critical faculties needed for research of a good quality. While preparing the background for better research tomorrow, research done today also helps in generating a climate of science in society. The scientific temper, characterized by commitment to truth, a rational attitude, spirit of enquiry, and the urge to experiment, is desirable for its own sake; in addition, it also prepares the soil in which technology can strike roots. Wholesale transplantation of technology from developed countries is unlikely to be able to generate self-sufficiency in poorly-prepared developing countries. One reason why our country has been able to adapt to the age of computers and mobile phones so well today is because of the encouragement scientific research has received since independence. In short, there are very powerful and valid reasons why developing countries should invest in research. Research is expensive; in the long run, not doing research is even more expensive.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch1lev2sec1"><h2 class="title">Why Me?</h2>
<p class="noindent">There may be good reasons why even poor countries should invest in research, but why should an individual get into research? Certainly <a name="page4"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">4</span></span>everybody does not have to get into research: a few will do. Who those few should be, we shall discuss in <a href="/9788184484175/chapter/ch2" class="ulink-exter">Chapter 2</a>. Here we shall discuss the good and not-so-good reasons which motivate people to choose scientific research as a career.</p>
<p class="indent">The reasons why individuals undertake research cover a wide spectrum ranging from curiosity to compulsion (<a href="#ch1tbl1" class="ulink-inter">Table 1.1</a>). While there is nothing strictly against research leading to a degree or providing a living, all research should be motivated at least partly, and preferably primarily, by the investigator's curiosity. Time is gone when research was a hobby on which scientists spent their savings, and to indulge in which they were prepared to even starve. Today research is a vocation. Fabulous grants and reasonably well-paid research jobs are a reality. The result has been a phenomenal increase in the number of scientists. It has been estimated that more than eighty percent of all the scientists who have ever lived on earth are alive today. While the expansion of scientific activities has accelerated the pace of genuine progress, it has also meant dilution of quality: a large volume of research work tends to be mediocre and repetitive. Fortunately, jobs in the management and information technology sectors have lately become far more remunerative than those in science. This is likely to ensure that only those genuinely interested in science will opt for it. At the same time, jobs in science should remain attractive enough to maintain enough competition among seekers of knowledge to ensure that only the best can survive. It may be asked, will some of the best brains continue to do science if really big money lies elsewhere? The answer is a resounding yes, because research can be great fun. Research is difficult, research is tedious, research is painful, but when observations collected assiduously over a long period of time fall into an unforeseen meaningful pattern, the thrill generated is no less than that experienced by a child when he completes a jigsaw puzzle.</p>

<p class="aligncenter"><bold>QUESTION</bold></p>
<p class="noindent">It has been mentioned that the expression ‘original and critical intellectual activity’ covers <span class="italic">almost</span> all types of research. Is there some research which it does not cover?</p>
<p class="aligncenter"><bold>ANSWER</bold></p>
<p class="noindent">There are some existential questions such as ‘what is the origin of the universe?’, ‘who am I?’ and ‘what is the purpose of life?’. These questions cannot be answered by performing experiments in the laboratory. The best method for exploring these issues is introspection in a state of intense concentration and self-purification. The process leads to observations which are subjective, and consequently methods of verification are different from those used in conventional research. Therefore some people would even question whether this activity can be called research. But to the extent that the exploration is motivated by curiosity, depends on dispassionate observation, and has reliable methods of verification, it can be termed research in the broadest sense of the word. But this research does not involve intellectual activity: it involves work at a plane of consciousness higher than the mental. Further, at higher than the mental planes, the word ‘critical’ becomes inappropriate. Therefore the expression ‘original and <span class="italic">critical intellectual</span> activity’ does not cover this type of research. To cover this type of research, the definition of research may be broadened to include all ‘original exploratory activity’. Some more light will be thrown on this question in <a href="/9788184484175/chapter/ch11" class="ulink-exter">Chapters 11</a> and <a href="/9788184484175/chapter/ch20" class="ulink-exter">20</a>.</p>
