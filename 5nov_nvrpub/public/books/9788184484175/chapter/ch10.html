Further, the approach, based on a mechanistic view of life, was pre-eminently successful. In less than a hundred years most of the prevalent infectious diseases and nutritional deficiencies were conquered, surgery became safe and painless, and diagnostic techniques touched dizzying heights. The research paradigm which had paid such rich dividends was the quantitative paradigm, which insisted on observations which were measurable and quantifiable. While the quantitative paradigm led to spectacular advances, it also restricted the thinking of medical scientists. It was almost forgotten that medicine can never be wholly a science – it will always be partly an art – and that doctors dealt not with microbes and molecules but with thinking and feeling human beings living within the framework of families and societies. However, these perennial truths were rediscovered in the middle of the twentieth century through a number of observations. To enumerate just a few of these observations, it was noted that the decline in the incidence of tuberculosis in developed countries preceded the discovery of anti-tubercular drugs by about twenty years, and coincided with improvements in nutritional status and environmental sanitation. Secondly, deaths due to diarrhea and respiratory tract infections in early life, which were highly prevalent in developing countries, were due to the mutual reinforcement of malnutrition and infections. Thus in infectious diseases, besides the agent, the host resistance was equally important. Thirdly, the emerging new killers of mankind such as hypertension and coronary artery disease were related to the lifestyle as a whole rather than to specific agents. Observations such as these gave birth to the discipline of <a name="page133"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">133</span></span>Preventive and Social Medicine.<sup><a href="#ch10fn1" class="ulink-inter">1</a></sup> With this development, the entry of the research methods of social sciences into medical research could not be far behind. The dominant research paradigm in social sciences is qualitative rather than quantitative. That is how we now have qualitative research also in medicine.<sup><a href="#ch10fn2" class="ulink-inter">2</a></sup></p><div class="section" id="ch10lev1sec1"><h1 class="title">WHAT IS QUALITATIVE RESEARCH?</h1>
<p class="noindent">Qualitative research peeps into the immediate world of the participants (generally not called subjects), observes and investigates how the participants view it and interact with it, and tries to discover in the findings a meaningful theme or pattern. The key words in qualitative research are subjectivity and flexibility. The <span class="italic">subjectivity</span> is both at the level of the observed and the observer. The participant looks at the issue in a subjective manner, and the observer interprets subjectively how the participant is looking at it. In short, the participant thinks and speaks, and the observer says what he thinks the participant is thinking. It is neither feasible nor necessary for the observer to be objective. However, it is both necessary and sufficient for the observer to be neutral. Neutrality demands that the observer should not superimpose his own preconceived ideas on what the participant is thinking.<sup><a href="#ch10fn3" class="ulink-inter">3</a></sup> <span class="italic">Flexibility</span> begins at the level of the research design and continues through data collection, analysis and interpretation. Not only are these steps and procedures not rigidly defined, in qualitative research these do not even occur in a strictly linear sequence. Thus the design may be revised after data collection begins, and data analysis and interpretation do not wait till data collection is over. The process as well as the product of research are flexible and unpredictable. Starting with identical research questions, two independent, competent and neutral investigators might come up with diametrically opposite answers.</p>

<p class="noindent"><sup class="footnote" id="ch10fn3">[<a href="#d1e7104">25</a>]</sup></p>
<p class="indent"><a name="page134"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">134</span></span>The subjectivity and flexibility of qualitative research are easily misinterpreted as lack of rigor by medical scientists who are deeply rooted in the quantitative paradigm. Just as objectivity is not important but neutrality is, reproducibility is not important in qualitative research but credibility is. A study is credible if its conclusions are grounded in data. The investigation is carried out without preconceived ideas about what might emerge from it. The data are collected, and a theory is allowed to emerge from the data. Theory being grounded in data is the strongest feature of qualitative research. The data in qualitative research consists of words, not numbers. But the conclusions of the research should be clearly and rationally based on the words which constitute the data. Thus qualitative research has its own yardsticks of scientific rigor.</p>
<p class="indent">In medicine, the aims of qualitative research are two-fold. <span class="italic">First,</span> it may be preliminary research on an unexplored area. The aim of such research is <span class="italic">to generate a hypothesis</span> using inductive logic. The hypothesis can then be tested by a larger quantitative study. Inductive logic uses specific facts to arrive at general conclusions. For example, suppose we wish to examine whether medical education is a dehumanizing process as is often asserted. To start with, we may interview a few first year medical students and a few final year students. Suppose their responses indicate that final year students are less compassionate and less concerned with ethical issues than first year students. We may conclude tentatively that medical education is indeed dehumanizing. But this conclusion is based on just a few open-ended, qualitative responses of an unrepresentative sample. Therefore we may state this conclusion only as a hypothesis. The hypothesis that ‘medical education is a dehumanizing process’ may now be examined by a study on a large representative sample of medical students who are given questionnaires, the responses to which can be quantified using a predetermined scoring scheme. The results may be analyzed statistically to see if a significant decline in human values takes place over the 5-year period spent in medical school. The qualitative study helps not only in hypothesis generation but also in framing the items for the quantifiable questionnaire. <span class="italic">Secondly,</span> qualitative research might be used <span class="italic">to evaluate alternative strategies</span> for application of existing knowledge. For example, one might use a qualitative research design to examine whether a booklet on nutrition is more effective than a Powerpoint presentation in influencing the knowledge, attitude and practices (KAP) positively. Thus qualitative research might find a place at the very beginning or at the end of quantitative research. It may <a name="page135"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">135</span></span>also form a component of a multimethod research project which has both qualitative and quantitative elements.</p>
<p class="indent">As indicated above, the steps in qualitative research from conception through publication are similar to those in quantitative research, which have been discussed already (<a href="/9788184484175/chapter/ch3" class="ulink-exter">Chapter 3</a>). The following discussion will focus on the unique features of these steps in qualitative research.</p>
</div><div class="section" id="ch10lev1sec2"><h1 class="title">GENESIS OF THE PROJECT</h1>
<p class="noindent">As is true of any creative endeavour, a project in qualitative research is also born as an idea. The idea may grow into a research question. But unlike in quantitative research, the research question may not be well-defined till the research has begun. Not only that, the question may get modified or supplemented as the research proceeds. This may create some difficulty if the project needs a grant from a funding agency. The reviewers of the project expect the research question to be specified. This can be done to the extent possible. Further, the possibility that the question might be modified, and the directions in which it might get modified, should also be mentioned in the research grant application. However, all this does not mean that a project in qualitative research needs no advance thought and preparation. Rather, the quality of the research depends on the quality of the thought and attention that have gone into it at the stage of planning. Anyway, as the hackneyed expression goes, anything worth doing is worth doing well.</p>
</div><div class="section" id="ch10lev1sec3"><h1 class="title">REVIEW OF LITERATURE</h1>
<p class="noindent">In most of the studies, it is desirable to review the literature while planning the project so that the proposed project can go beyond similar previous studies. However, in those qualitative research projects in which the aim is hypothesis generation, it is considered desirable to delay reviewing the literature till data analysis is complete. The reason behind this apparently irrational practice is to ensure that the emerging hypothesis or theory is truly grounded in data. Reviewing the literature in advance can influence data collection and analysis in such a way as to affect the conclusions. Further, in the case of some such projects, there may not be much literature available to review.</p>
</div><div class="section" id="ch10lev1sec4"><h1 class="title">SAMPLING</h1>
<p class="noindent">In quantitative research, the ideal is a large randomly selected sample so that the sample is representative of the population being studied. <a name="page136"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">136</span></span>This is considered important because the aim is to arrive at conclusions which are as context-free as possible, and can be generalized as well as extrapolated freely. Generalizable conclusions are not the aim of qualitative research. Instead, in qualitative research, a detailed description of the context is a part of the research report so that the reader can judge how far the results can be applied or transferred in another comparable but different situation. Since the sample in qualitative research does not have to be representative, it need be neither random nor large. Sometimes the sample may consist of just one subject (as in a case report).</p>
<p class="indent">The sampling technique in qualitative research is called <span class="italic">purposive</span> sampling. A purposeful (i.e. one which fulfills a purpose) sample is obtained by using one of the following strategies (Patton 1987, pp. 51-60).</p>
<div class="section" id="ch10lev2sec1"><h2 class="title">Extreme or Deviant Case Sampling</h2>
<p class="noindent">Suppose we wish to study the factors affecting the regularity of attendance at an antenatal clinic. One way to do so is to interview a random sample of patients registered at the clinic. But a better sample would consist of a few patients who are very regular, and a few patients who are very irregular.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch10lev2sec2"><h2 class="title">Maximum Variation Sampling</h2>
<p class="noindent">Suppose we wish to study the reaction to a family planning drive. A good way to get maximum information from a relatively small sample is to make sure that our sample has a few representatives of each socio-economic group, educational level, age group, religion, gender and background (rural vs. urban).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch10lev2sec3"><h2 class="title">Homogenous Sampling</h2>
<p class="noindent">Qualitative studies do not always need a large variety in the sample. Sometimes in-depth study of a small homogenous sub-group may be more revealing. Suppose we wish to study the effect of the number of siblings a child has on its psychological characteristics. Instead of a maximum variation sample, here it may be more rewarding to start with a sample of single children brought up in nuclear families of high socioeconomic status where both parents are working.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch10lev2sec4"><h2 class="title">Typical Case Sampling</h2>
<p class="noindent">Suppose we wish to document the clinical and laboratory findings of an epidemic of an undiagnosed baffling disease. It makes more sense to base our description on typical cases rather than on the extremes or exceptions.<a name="page137"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">137</span></span></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch10lev2sec5"><h2 class="title">Critical Case Sampling</h2>
<p class="noindent">In critical case sampling, the aim is to have a small sample which can make a point very effectively. For example, suppose we have prepared a health education booklet for diabetics but are not sure whether the presentation is simple enough to be understood by the patients. To address this doubt, we might first give the booklet to a few patients whose educational level is postgraduation and above to read, and evaluate their comprehension. These highly educated patients are critical cases because if they cannot understand the booklet, we can be sure nobody will.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch10lev2sec6"><h2 class="title">Convenience Sampling</h2>
<p class="noindent">The only criterion of convenience sampling is to find a sample which can be studied easily and quickly. “This is probably the most common sampling strategy – and the least desirable” (Patton 1987, pp. 57-58). It is wrong to think that just because the sample can be small and results do not have to be generalizable in a qualitative study, any sample will do. Sampling in qualitative studies needs a carefully thought out strategy which would give us an <span class="italic">information-rich</span> sample which fulfills a <span class="italic">purpose.</span> The sample of sampling strategies outlined here is not exhaustive, but adequate for the purpose of this book!</p>
</div>
</div><div class="section" id="ch10lev1sec5"><h1 class="title">DATA COLLECTION</h1>
<p class="noindent">The basic principle of data collection in qualitative research is to seek facts from the subjects by observing them and/or talking to them, as far as possible in their natural environment. There is a variety of such methods available, and the investigator can choose one or more of the methods most appropriate for the project. The broad categories of methods are participant observation, individual interviews, and focus group interviews.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch10lev2sec7"><h2 class="title">Participant Observation</h2>
<p class="noindent">To some extent, the observer is always a participant in the process of observing. But participant observation usually implies more than that. The least that it calls for is a rapport between the observer and the observed. At the other extreme, the observer may integrate himself with the participants so completely as to be treated as one of them.</p>
<p class="indent">The observations made on the participants may be completely unstructured. The observer notes down all their utterances, activities and feelings which seem broadly relevant to the project. At the other <a name="page138"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">138</span></span>extreme, the observer's notes may consist only of tick marks on a pre-determined check-list. There could also be various intermediate levels of structure in the observations. The observations made in the field may be supplemented by individual conversations with a few key informants. <span class="italic">Key informants</span> are persons who seem to be particularly knowledgeable and articulate. Apart from giving some valuable facts, key informants can also lead the investigators to other key informants. This type of expansion of the sample after the study has begun is quite acceptable in qualitative research.<sup><a href="#ch10fn4" class="ulink-inter">4</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">The simplest technique for recording the observations in a field study is to take field notes. This is also the method which fulfills best the requirement of interfering the least with the activity or phenomenon being observed. These notes may be rough, incomplete, and haphazard. They may also include a lot of innovative ‘abbreviations’ and ‘shorthand’. Therefore, as a principle, field notes should be expanded into a ‘fair’ version the same day after the investigator returns from the field.</p>
<p class="indent">A tape recorder gives a far more complete version of verbal data than field notes. Most participants do not object to the use of the tape recorder provided they are assured that the sole purpose is to make data collection complete and convenient. However, field notes should be taken even if the tape recorder is used because:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p class="">the tape recorder cannot record non-verbal data,</p></li>
<li><p class="">the tape recorder cannot record selectively what is more important to the investigator, and</p></li>
<li><p class="">the recording may fail or turn out to be poor in quality.</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="indent">Video recording, or combined audio and video recording gives the completest possible record. But it should be avoided, unless the nature of the project demands it because:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p class="">it interferes with the spontaneity of subjects,</p></li>
<li><p class="">the subjects might object to it,</p></li>
<li><p class="">ethical consideration might prohibit it, or prohibit its exhibition to anyone other than the investigators.</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="indent">As in case of the tape recorder, field notes should be taken even if combined audio and video recording has been arranged.</p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="ch10lev2sec8"><h2 class="title">Individual Interviews</h2>
<p class="noindent">Interviewing individuals, usually key informants, is a standard method of data collection in qualitative research. Conducting an interview is an art, and needs training. Interviewing needs qualities of the head as well as heart. The interviewer should be able to establish a good rapport with the interviewee. Further, he should also be neutral, or at least appear neutral, so that the subject can express his opinions freely without having to take into account the interviewer's opinions. The neutrality should be reflected in the wording of the questions as well as the tone in which they are asked, and in the body language. In addition, the questions should be small in number, and unambiguous. Last but not least, the questions in qualitative research are open-ended. Open-ended questions require a uniquely individual answer from the respondent in his own words, in his own style. This is in contrast with closed questions which expect in response one out of a set of given alternatives. Closed questions are the norm in quantitative research because these can be easily quantified.</p>
<p class="indent">There are three basic types of qualitative interviews (Patton 1987, pp. 108-143):</p>
<div class="section" id="ch10lev3sec1"><h3 class="title">The Informal Conversational Interview</h3>
<p class="noindent">Here the questions are not framed in advance. An informal conversation on the topic of research is initiated, and questions are taken up as and when they emerge from the conversation. However, the interviewer should remember that he is conducting an interview, not having a discussion. Therefore the respondent should be allowed to speak more, and the interviewer should listen. Secondly, the interviewer should remain neutral. The analysis of data collected through conversational interviews can be quite difficult.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch10lev3sec2"><h3 class="title">The Interview Guide</h3>
<p class="noindent">Here an interview guide is prepared in advance. The guide contains a list of the topics and issues to be explored in the interview. The exact wording of the questions and the sequence in which the topics are explored is determined during the interview by the interviewer depending on how it is going. The list of topics in the guide serves as a check-list so that by the end of the interview all essential points have been covered.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch10lev3sec3"><h3 class="title">The Standardized Open-ended Interview</h3>
<p class="noindent">Here the questions, including the words in which they will be asked, are written down in advance. All the respondents are then asked <a name="page140"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">140</span></span>exactly the same questions in the same sequence in nearly the same words.</p>
<p class="indent">The three approaches to interviewing may be mixed. An informal conversation may precede or follow a standardized interview. A short interview guide may be built up in the margins of the notes in the course of the interview depending on what topics the interviewer thinks will be worth exploring after the standardized interview is over.</p>
<p class="indent">Regarding recording of data, as in case of participant observation, field notes are of primary importance. In addition, audiorecording is valuable. In some cases, it may be appropriate to have some written responses from the subject besides the oral interview.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch10lev2sec9"><h2 class="title">Focus Group Interviews</h2>
<p class="noindent">Focus group interviews started with marketing research but are now being used for qualitative research in a wide variety of disciplines including medicine. We normally associate the word interview with a one-to-one interaction, but in a focus group, a group of 5-10 persons is interviewed simultaneously. The word focus is a reminder that the interaction is focused on a topic because a group interaction can easily lose direction. Superficially, the interaction may look like a group discussion. But one should remember that a focus group is neither a discussion nor a problem-solving session. It is an interview, i.e. the purpose is to elicit the views of the participants. The interviewer is, in a focus group, called the moderator. In short, a focus group interview is a technique for eliciting the individual opinions of a group of persons on a topic supplied by the researcher (Morgan 1997). However, the individuals are allowed to modify or revise their opinions during the interview in light of what the other members of the group say.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch10lev3sec4"><h3 class="title">Design</h3>
<p class="noindent">There are a few rules of thumb for a focus group interviewer. The interaction should be moderately or highly structured. The groups should have 6-10 participants. Usually 4-6 such groups are required for a research project. The participants within a group are homogenous in terms of age, socioeconomic status, educational level, and sometimes gender. The members of a group should not be already known to each other. However, none of these rules is sacrosanct: any of these rules may be broken if doing so is likely to improve the quality of the research.<a name="page141"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">141</span></span></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch10lev3sec5"><h3 class="title">Conducting a Focus Group Interview</h3>
<p class="noindent">Conducting a focus group interview needs not only interviewing skills but also group skills. The moderator should ensure that in a period of about 90 minutes, all the questions are covered, and each participant has been able to express his opinion on each question. There should also be scope for the same person to speak more than once on the same topic. Revising or supplementing a previous response is acceptable. In fact, that happens quite a bit because new ideas come to participants in response to the opinions expressed by other members of the group. The moderator should see that someone who knows a little more about the subject than others is not able to pose as an ‘expert’ and influence everybody else's opinion. A drift towards conformity should be avoided as much as a drift towards polarization. Last but not least, the atmosphere should be relaxed so that everybody is able to express his thoughts freely and frankly, and the whole experience is enjoyable. It is difficult for the moderator to conduct the session and at the same time take notes. Therefore it is better to have two persons – a moderator to conduct the session, and a rapporteur to take notes.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch10lev3sec6"><h3 class="title">Advantages of Focus Group Interviews</h3>
<p class="noindent">The technique is quick and easy. It allows a large number of persons to be interviewed in relatively less time. But its real advantage, which the moderator should be conscious of, is generation of ideas. The availability of a few more persons talking about the same thing should help each participant crystallize his opinion and express it better. A focus group minimizes expression of extreme, impulsive or crazy ideas.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch10lev3sec7"><h3 class="title">Drawbacks of Focus Group Interviews</h3>
<p class="noindent">The principal drawback of focus groups is that it is difficult to collect the required group of people at one place at one time. Therefore while planning the exercise, one should arrange for about 20% more persons than the minimum required in order to take care of no-shows. Further, some participants may come late; some others may want to leave early. The number of questions that can be taken up is much less than in an individual interview. The moderator of a focus group has to be much more skilled than the person conducting a structured individual interview. The moderator may also end up influencing the opinions of participants.<a name="page142"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">142</span></span></p>
<p class="indent">The setting of a focus group is not naturalistic. A group of strangers is engaged in a discussion to serve the ends of a researcher. Therefore the opinions may be coloured by the consideration of what will seem right to say in such a setting. A tendency for conformity or polarization might develop in spite of the efforts of the moderator. If two or three persons in the group accidentally turn out to be known to each other, they might have a tendency to form a group within the group. Finally, there may develop unexpected problems due to differences in status, age or gender within the group.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div><div class="section" id="ch10lev1sec6"><h1 class="title">ANALYSIS AND INTERPRETATION OF DATA</h1>
<p class="noindent">In qualitative research, the course of events is iterative rather than linear. Data analysis begins soon after data collection starts, and analysis and interpretation also go hand in hand. Interpretation suggests more analysis from a different angle, and every fresh analysis enriches the interpretation. The data in qualitative research consists of words. Since words are not as precise as numbers, there are fewer rules and set procedures for analysis. The data can be looked at from several angles. Accordingly, different individuals might analyse the same data differently and even reach somewhat different conclusions. As in all other research, the best way to begin the analysis of qualitative research data also is to immerse oneself in the data to get its feel. That itself suggests the best strategies for analysis.</p>
<p class="indent">The styles of analysis in qualitative research vary enormously. They fall somewhere on a long and continuous spectrum ranging from highly objective to extremely subjective. For convenience, these styles may be classified into four groups (Miller and Crabtree 1992).</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="italic">Quasi-statistical methods</span> involve searching the data for certain words or themes. The words and themes are sorted into categories and analysed statistically, e.g. counting the number of entries in each category. This method is relatively simple and appeals to those familiar with quantitative research. It is a sort of quantitative analysis of qualitative data.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="italic">Template analysis</span> uses a template or analysis guide. The template differs from the codebook of quasi-statistical methods in that:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p class="">it is more open-ended,</p></li>
<li><p class="">it undergoes revision as the analysis proceeds, and</p></li>
<li><p class="">the conclusions are based on conceptual churning of analysed data rather than on statistical treatment.</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="indent">The <span class="italic">editing</span> style of analysis involves looking at the data like an editor. The text is pruned and rearranged, reducing its length while <a name="page143"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">143</span></span>enhancing its clarity with minimum of rephrasing. There is no template used. The edited text is examined for patterns and connections, which are then reported as conclusions of the study.</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="italic">immersion/crystallization</span> style of analysis is the most subjective. The researcher immerses himself in the data, reflects over it, till the most significant features of the data crystallize in his mind. The process of immersion and crystallization is repeated till the researcher is satisfied that his conclusions are possibly the most faithful derivation of the data.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch10lev2sec10"><h2 class="title">Coding</h2>
<p class="noindent">Irrespective of the style of analysis, some form of coding of data is usually involved. The codebook might have been prepared in advance when the project was being designed, or it may emerge from the data, or it might finally be a combination of both. Recurrent themes, patterns and connections may occur at different points in the data. Since the data is usually voluminous, it is helpful if similar portions can be placed together and read together. Suppose there are six different recurrent themes or connections of interest, A through F. We can give them code numbers: A,1; B,2; C,3 and so on. In the margins we can put 1, or 2 or 3 etc. wherever the corresponding themes occur. Then all the portions labeled 1 can be brought together to one place, portions labeled 2 to another place, and so on. If one resorts to ‘cut and paste’ for doing so, it is important to do that with only a photocopy of the data. The original should be kept as it is because the exact form and sequence in which the original data was collected can be useful and necessary at many subsequent stages. If the number of categories into which the data has to be sorted is small, one can use a colour code instead of a number code.</p>
<p class="indent">It is not essential that every bit of the data has to be coded. Some data may not be very relevant to the project: such redundancy is inevitable in qualitative research. On the other hand, some segments of the data may belong to more than one code. It needs considerable self-discipline to make sure that failure to have enough codes is not due to fatigue or boredom. On the other hand one has to resist sentimental attachment to data which may make it difficult to ‘waste’ even one sentence of the data.</p>
<p class="indent">Coding does not exclude some margin notes. As one mulls over the data during coding, some flashes of critical or interpretive insight are quite likely. These precious illuminations should not be lost. They should be immediately preserved in the form of jottings in the margins.<a name="page144"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">144</span></span></p>
<p class="indent">Coding of data generally creates multiple levels of themes. The upper level themes are often available from the aims and objectives of the project. The lower level themes (rather, sub-themes) are generally the result of multiple readings of the data. While writing up the work, the upper level themes supply the major headings, and the lower level categories give us the sub-headings.</p>
<p class="indent">As is obvious, coding is essentially a data management tool. And as you might be thinking already, computers can be very useful for performing many of the operations associated with coding.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch10lev2sec11"><h2 class="title">Using Computers for Data Analysis</h2>
<p class="noindent">Qualitative research generates voluminous data. Computers can be very helpful in managing and organizing this data, and several software programmes specially suitable for qualitative research are available. Computers are principally useful at the following stages of data processing (Reid Jr. 1992).</p>
<div class="section" id="ch10lev3sec8"><h3 class="title">Data Preparation</h3>
<p class="noindent">Raw data, which may be in the form of jottings, handwritten notes and audio-recordings are all converted into neatly typed material after minor editing. Using the line-numbering option helps subsequent analysis.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch10lev3sec9"><h3 class="title">Data Identification</h3>
<p class="noindent">The data are divided into coded segments.</p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Searching for some key words in the data, bringing similarly coded segments together, and various types of rearrangements of data can be performed using ‘Copy’ and ‘Paste’ functions, or by using special software.</p>
<p class="indent">However, computers are only a data management tool. They can do many tedious and time-consuming parts of analysis quickly and easily. That relieves the researcher for doing more interesting parts of analysis. There is no substitute for the researcher immersing himself in the data for discovering in it meaning and relevance.</p>

</div><div class="section" id="ch10lev1sec7"><h1 class="title">REPORTING</h1>
<p class="noindent">The format for reporting qualitative research is more flexible than is the case with quantitative research. The choices to be made are regarding which part of the data to include and that which may be <a name="page145"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">145</span></span>excluded; which segment may be paraphrased and which quoted exactly as it was said by one of the participants; and how to connect it all so that the report is lucid and easy to grasp. The report should include description of the project, analysis and interpretation of data, validity checks built into the study, supporting evidence from other studies, conflicts with other studies and their plausible explanations, and strengths and weaknesses of the study.</p>
<p class="indent">With developments in technology, it is now possible to supplement a written report with an interactive compact disc (CD). The CD can use the hypertext format. In this format, ‘link buttons’ can be furnished which lead the reader to additional material on a particular part of the report. It also gives better control to the reader regarding how much to read, what to read, and in what sequence. Further, one may move from the world of hypertext to that of hypermedia. This enables the ‘reader’ to see graphics, video images, and hear extracts from interviews. Preparing a report with hypertext and hypermedia applications is very laborious and time-consuming, but if the situation warrants, at least the possibilities now exist.</p>
</div><div class="section" id="ch10lev1sec8"><h1 class="title">CLOSING THOUGHTS</h1>
<p class="noindent">This chapter should clear at least two common misunderstandings – one, that qualitative research is not really research; and two, that if in a questionnaire-based study, the questions are open-ended, it becomes qualitative research. Qualitative research is valid and rigorous, with its own philosophy, logic and tradition, and is much more than open-ended questions. It needs training and experience to do good qualitative research. The process of qualitative research is iterative rather than linear. The research design may be revised when data collection begins; analysis goes on along with data collection; analysis may influence the subsequent data collection; interpretation accompanies analysis, and may lead to re-analysis from a different angle. The salient differences between qualitative and quantitative research have been shown in <a href="#ch10tbl1" class="ulink-inter">Table 10.1</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">As is clear from <a href="#ch10tbl1" class="ulink-inter">Table 10.1</a>, both qualitative and quantitative approaches have a place in seeking truth, and both have their own strengths and weaknesses. Further, the two approaches are not mutually exclusive. In some situations, the two approaches can be combined in the same study. Many public health studies and clinical trials, be they longitudinal, cross-sectional or case-control studies, can have a qualitative component built in which would enrich them.<a name="page146"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">146</span></span></p>

<p class="indent">Moon et al (1990) believe that qualitative research could help bridge the gap between clinicians and researchers because the qualitative methods are closer to the world of the clinician than the quantitative methods. Qualitative researchers ask the kind of questions that clinicians often ask, and explore these questions in ways that are clinically meaningful.</p>
<p class="aligncenter"><bold>QUESTIONS AND PROBLEMS</bold></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p class="">What is the difference between inductive and deductive logic?</p></li>
<li><p class="">What is triangulation?</p></li>
<li><p class="">What is heuristic research?</p></li>
<li><p class="">What is hermeneutic research?</p></li>
<li><p class="">What is the difference between focus groups, delphi groups and nominal groups?</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="aligncenter"><bold>ANSWERS AND SOLUTIONS</bold></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p class="">Inductive logic uses specific facts to derive generalities. Deductive logic uses generalities to reach specific conclusions.</p>
<p class="">This may be illustrated by a hypothetical example. Suppose a physician is told by 10 of his diabetic patients in quick succession that they have taken <span class="italic">methi</span> (Fenugreek) seeds and benefited from it. From these specific facts, he generates the hypothesis that <span class="italic">Fenugreek seeds help diabetes.</span> This is akin to qualitative research. <a name="page147"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">147</span></span>Then the physician conducts a randomized controlled trial (RCT) on the efficacy of Fenugreek seeds in diabetes to test the hypothesis. If the RCT supports the hypothesis, the physician reaches the general conclusion that Fenugreek seeds help diabetes. This is quantitative research, but the logic is still inductive. The specific individual responses of a large representative sample of diabetic patients have been processed statistically to reach the general conclusion. Now, the patient prescribes Fenugreek seeds to his next diabetic patient. The prescription is based on logic which runs somewhat like this: Since <span class="italic">fenugreek seeds help diabetes,</span> the seeds are likely to help this diabetic patient also. Since this logic derives a specific conclusion from a general truth, it is deductive logic.</p>
<p class="">Thus research, in general, uses inductive logic. Medical practice, on the other hand, uses deductive logic.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Triangulation is the use of multiple approaches to reach more valid conclusions in research. Although the term is popular only in qualitative research, the principle applies to all research. If multiple approaches lead to the same conclusion, the conclusion is more reliable. The term triangulation is based on the fact that the triangle is the strongest of all geometrical shapes. However, this does not mean that the number of approaches in triangulation should be exactly three. There are four basic types of triangulation (Denzin 1978): first, using more than one source of data; second, more than one scientist analyzing and interpreting the same data; third, using more than one perspective to interpret the same data; and fourth, using more than one method to examine the same research question. The last of these is frequently used in medicine. For example, a clinical study, an animal study and a cell culture study may look at the relationship between dietary fat and atherosclerosis. If their conclusions are consistent with one another, the conclusion becomes stronger.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The major tool of heuristic research is self-reflection. Although it has a mystical air about it (<a href="/9788184484175/chapter/ch11" class="ulink-exter">Chapters 11</a> and <a href="/9788184484175/chapter/ch20" class="ulink-exter">20</a>), the term may also be applied if the observer also becomes a participant in the participant observation method, and analyses the data primarily by immersion/crystallization.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Hermeneutics is a difficult-sounding word with a simple meaning: it basically means interpretation. It has been derived from Hermes, the Greek god who acted as a hotline between earth and the abode of gods (somewhat like Narada in Indian mythology). Hermes <a name="page148"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">148</span></span>carried messages from gods to people, and interpreted them for the people. Hermeneutic research involves interacting with the participants followed by interpreting the interaction. As is clear, hermeneutic research would include quite a bit of qualitative research.</p></li>
<li><p class="">These are all group elicitation techniques. In <span class="italic">focus groups,</span> there is no attempt to reach a consensus or to solve a problem. In <span class="italic">delphi groups,</span> there is an attempt to arrive at a consensus or at least establish the range of opinion. The process is a ‘think tank’ technique. The participants do not meet face-to-face but express opinions through mail or e-mail, and are assured anonymity. In <span class="italic">nominal groups,</span> a consensus is arrived at systematically. All ideas expressed in the group are ranked by the participants according to some criteria. The outcome is a synthesis of individual efforts. (For details, see <a href="http://www.theorywatch.com/ist501/grpelicit.html" class="weblink">www.theorywatch.com/ist501/grpelicit.html</a>).</p></li>
