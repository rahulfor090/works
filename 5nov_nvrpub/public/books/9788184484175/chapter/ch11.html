Starting almost from scratch about four hundred years ago, today science embodies an enormous wealth of knowledge and understanding of the laws of nature. Further, technological applications of science within the last hundred years have changed our lives beyond recognition. A variety of time- and labour-saving machines, life-saving drugs and painless surgery, safe and comfortable automobiles and aeroplanes, internet and e-mail, have all led to changes in lifestyle which are entirely unprecedented in human history in both pace and extent.<sup><a href="#ch11fn1" class="ulink-inter">1</a></sup> Even the most staunch votaries of simplicity would be very uncomfortable if <span class="italic">all</span> the products of modern science were taken away from them. The overall effect of science and technology has been so overwhelming that the word ‘scientific’ has become almost synonymous with being true, valid and worthwhile. Advertisements for foods, furniture and detergents claim that the recommended brand has been designed ‘scientifically’, as if that is enough as the guarantee of quality. In keeping with this general trend, every branch of knowledge is keen to qualify as a branch of science.</p><p class="">_____________</p><p class="noindent"><sup class="footnote" id="ch11fn1">[<a href="#d1e7908">27</a>]</sup></p><p class="noindent"><a name="page150"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">150</span></span>Methods of scientific research have been embraced wholeheartedly by history, sociology, anthropology, linguistics and even literature! Psychology, a subject on the borderline between science and arts, has undergone a voluntary amputation to assert its status as a science.<sup><a href="#ch11fn2" class="ulink-inter">2</a></sup> Therefore, it is not surprising that lately there has been a trend among ancient disciplines like yoga to get a certificate of validity from modern science. While the trend is understandable, it is important to realize that the methods of science are appropriate for generating <span class="italic">a certain kind of</span> knowledge. Hence knowledge generated by science has certain boundaries, but knowledge itself knows no boundaries. That, by itself, does not make all knowledge outside the boundaries of science untrue, invalid or worthless. Fortunately, the boundaries of science are expanding: rapid expansion of qualitative research is just one instance of this expansion (<a href="/9788184484175/chapter/ch10" class="ulink-exter">Chapter 10</a>). Therefore, the environment today is ripe for conducting research on subjects which may stretch the limits of science further. In this chapter, we shall concentrate on the possibilities, pitfalls and limitations of scientific research on yoga: much of the discussion would apply also to other practices rooted in spirituality, such as Tai-chi or Zen meditation. We shall also have a critical look at intercessory prayer research in relation to healing, which has received accelerated attention during the last twenty years.</p><div class="section" id="ch11lev1sec1"><h1 class="title">WHAT IS YOGA?</h1>
<p class="noindent">Yoga is a journey towards self-perfection. Since perfection is a very distant goal for man, who is basically imperfect, yoga employs some techniques to accelerate the pace of the journey. These techniques, being the most visible part of yoga, are popularly but erroneously equated with yoga. The goal of yoga, i.e. perfection, is a characteristic of only the Divine. Therefore, the goal of yoga is often said to be union with the Divine.<sup><a href="#ch11fn3" class="ulink-inter">3</a></sup> Much before the goal is reached in yoga, there are many changes observed in the traveler on the path. He grows in love and compassion, his work improves in efficiency and quality, he becomes physically and mentally healthier, and if he has a disease, he may start recovering from it. It is some of these effects which are the subject of much of scientific research on yoga.</p>

<p class="noindent"><a name="page151"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">151</span></span>Here is the first snag: a seeker on the path of yoga is on a spiritual quest, and in the process receives some tangible fringe benefits on the way. On the other hand, research is often done on subjects who are not spiritual seekers but have been asked to practice some of the yogic techniques mechanically, and the investigator examines whether the expected beneficial effects have taken place. With this background, let us look at the pros and cons of research on yoga.</p>
</div><div class="section" id="ch11lev1sec2"><h1 class="title">RESEARCH ON YOGA</h1>
<p class="noindent">Research on yoga may be basic research which looks primarily at its physiological effects, or clinical research which looks at the efficacy of yogic interventions in various diseases.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch11lev2sec1"><h2 class="title">Research on Physiological Effects of Yoga</h2>
<p class="noindent">Some of the pioneering scientific research on yoga was done at the All India Institute of Medical Science (AIIMS) in the Department of Physiology. At AIIMS the tradition continues, and studies on the physiological effects of yoga are also being done at the Defence Institute of Physiology and Allied Sciences (DIPAS), New Delhi. An impressive volume of research in this area was done in 1970s and 1980s on the effects of Transcendental meditation (TM). Currently, the largest volume of good quality research in this area is probably being conducted at Swami Vivekananda Yoga Anusandhana Samsthana (SVYASA), Bangalore.<sup><a href="#ch11fn4" class="ulink-inter">4</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">To study the physiological effects of yoga, the ideal subjects are accomplished yogis. But accomplished yogis are, firstly, very few, and secondly, are often reluctant to participate in research experiments.<sup><a href="#ch11fn5" class="ulink-inter">5</a></sup> Therefore, such studies have too few subjects for valid statistical analysis. The classical study which examined the ability of yogis to stop the heart at will had only four subjects (Wenger et al 1961), and the one which studied the metabolic rate of a yogi in a sealed box (to stimulate the conditions in an underground pit) had only one subject (Anand et al 1961).</p>
<p class="">_____________</p>
<p class="noindent"><sup class="footnote" id="ch11fn4">[<a href="#d1e7989">30</a>]</sup></p>
<p class="noindent"><sup class="footnote" id="ch11fn5">[<a href="#d1e7996">31</a>]</sup></p>
<p class="indent"><a name="page152"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">152</span></span>The problem of too small an ‘n’ has been overcome in two ways, both unsatisfactory compared to the ideal of studying accomplished yogis. The less unsatisfactory method is to study subjects who have voluntarily learnt a specific yogic technique for a reasonable length of time. These subjects may not be accomplished yogis, but are at least proficient in the technique they have learnt. In the 1970s and 1980s, the transcendental meditation (TM) technique attracted large numbers throughout the world. Hence the studies on the effects of TM have a reasonably large number of subjects. Further, the subjects had learnt the technique voluntarily and were, therefore, well-motivated. They had been practicing the technique for some time, and were therefore quite proficient in the technique. Moreover, they also had a sense of devotion to the guru who had developed the technique, and, as is well-known, a family feeling develops among such devotees. Therefore, if the investigator is a devotee, other devotees volunteer to be subjects willingly and enthusiastically. Similar considerations also apply to the large number of recent studies on sudarshan kriya (SK).<sup><a href="#ch11fn6" class="ulink-inter">6</a></sup> The drawback of studies on TM and SK, however, is that they have investigated the effects of a specific yogic technique, not of yoga. This drawback has, to a large extent, been overcome by the recent studies done at SVYASA on those who have been exposed to at least a few months of training in an integrated package of yogic philosophy, lifestyle and techniques.</p>
<p class="indent">The most unsatisfactory but highly popular method of studying the effects of yoga is to teach some elementary yogic techniques to a ‘captive’ population like students, soldiers, patients or prisoners, and observe the effects of the training. These studies are unsatisfactory because the training is often inadequate, the practice half-hearted, and participation in the study less than voluntary.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch11lev3sec1"><h3 class="title">Limitations of Research on Physiological Effects of Yoga</h3>
<p class="noindent">The classical study by Dr. BK Anand and his colleagues in which they demonstrated alpha preponderance in yogis was a cross-sectional, uncontrolled study (Anand et al 1961a).</p>
<p class="">_____________</p>
<p class="noindent"><sup class="footnote" id="ch11fn6">[<a href="#d1e8025">32</a>]</sup></p>
<p class="noindent"><a name="page153"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">153</span></span>Such a study is open to a lot of valid criticism. First, how do we know whether yoga altered the EEG spectrum of the subjects. Is it not possible that they had alpha predominance even before taking to yoga? It may even be possible that those who have alpha predominance are more likely to be attracted to yoga. Finally, even if the alpha preponderance developed after practicing yoga, the effect may not be specific to yoga. Therefore, it is important that besides an adequate number of subjects, enough attention is paid to the experimental design.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch11lev3sec2"><h3 class="title">Designing a Study on the Physiological Effects of Yoga</h3>
<p class="noindent">A good study on the physiological effects of yoga should be a controlled longitudinal study. The subjects should be divided randomly into two groups. The baseline data should be recorded on both groups. The experimental group should be trained in yoga for a few weeks or months. The control group should be trained in appropriate non-yogic techniques for the same period. Although it is difficult to design a good control for yogic techniques, some suggestions have been given in <a href="#ch11tbl1" class="ulink-inter">Table 11.1</a>.</p>

<p class="indent">At the end of the training period, the end-points should be measured in both groups. The pre-training and post-training data should be compared within each group. Further, between group comparisons should also be made to determine whether the change, if any, in the experimental group is comparable to or significantly greater than that in the control group. The experimental design has been summarized in <a href="#ch11fig1" class="ulink-inter">Figure 11.1</a>.

<p class="noindent">These are difficult to measure, and are therefore, normally not studied. Completely out of the reach of scientific research are the changes in the level of consciousness which result from the pursuit of yoga. Those pursuing yoga seriously argue that the effects of yoga beyond the reach of scientific research are actually the most significant. Thus scientists only study the superficial and least important effects of yoga. This subject has been dealt with in greater detail later in the chapter under research on consciousness.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch11lev2sec2"><h2 class="title">Research on the Efficacy of Yoga in Disease States</h2>
<p class="noindent">As in case of other new modalities of treatment, the gold standard for evaluating the efficacy of yoga is also the randomized controlled <a name="page155"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">155</span></span>trial (RCT). However, conducting an RCT on the efficacy of yoga poses some unique problems which have been discussed below.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch11lev3sec4"><h3 class="title">Problems and Limitations in Conducting an RCT on Yoga</h3>
<p class="noindent">The first problem is to decide on the treatment that should be given to the control group. It is unethical to give no treatment at all to the control group because some conventional treatment is generally available for the disease for which the efficacy of yoga is being tested.<sup><a href="#ch11fn7" class="ulink-inter">7</a></sup> For the same reason, the control group cannot be given only a placebo. Moreover, it is virtually impossible to design a placebo for yoga practices. Therefore, the control is generally given the conventional treatment.</p>
<p class="indent">The second issue to be considered is what treatment should be given to the experimental group. For ethical reasons, even the experimental group cannot be denied conventional treatment. Therefore, the experimental group receives not only yoga but also the conventional treatment.</p>
<p class="indent">A good RCT is usually double-blind. In an RCT on yoga, the investigators may be ‘blinded’ but it is impossible to ‘blind’ the patients.</p>
<p class="indent">If a patient participates in a trial on the efficacy of yoga, he generally expects lessons on yoga. Therefore, even the control group cannot be denied yoga; moreover, it would be unethical to do so. Therefore, the control group is only a wait-listed control. After the study is over, all willing participants in the control group are also taught yoga.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, there should ideally be also a third group (an additional control group) which receives the conventional treatment plus substitute for yogic practices as given in <a href="#ch11tbl1" class="ulink-inter">Table 11.1</a>. But this group is generally omitted because it is extremely difficult to retain control patients for the entire study period in a study on yoga.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch11lev3sec5"><h3 class="title">Designing an RCT on the Efficacy of Yoga</h3>
<p class="noindent">In view of the above discussion, a feasible and satisfactory design for an RCT on the efficacy of yoga is as shown in <a href="#ch11fig2" class="ulink-inter">Figure 11.2</a>. After a lead-in (or run-in) period of one or two weeks, the volunteers who satisfy the inclusion criteria are divided randomly into two groups. The baseline parameters are recorded for both groups.</p>
<p class="">_____________</p>
<p class="noindent"><sup class="footnote" id="ch11fn7">[<a href="#d1e8257">33</a>]</sup></p>

<div class="figure" id="ch11fig2" data-label="Fig. 11.2"><div class="title"><span class="item-label">Fig. 11.2</span> The experimental design for a randomized controlled trial on the efficacy of yoga in a disease state. 1-5, points at which outcome measures may be measured. The most crucial for comparison are the measurements made at points 2 and 5. The comparison between measurements made at points 1 and 2 tells us how far the lead-in period was useful in making the two groups more similar to each other in terms of the baseline data. Measurements made at points 3 and 4 give an insight into the time course of changes during the study period. For example they tell us whether favorable changes had begun in the experimental group by point 3, the point at which the maximum effect was achieved, whether further improvement might be expected beyond point 5, whether prolonged treatment leads to reversal of early gains, etc. tt, treatment; trg, training.</div><img alt="Fig. 11.2" src="/MediumImage/156-1.jpg"><div class="additional-markup"></div></div>
<p class="noindent">The control group is put on the conventional treatment. The experimental group is also put on the conventional treatment but receives, in addition, training in yoga. The duration of treatment is variable, but generally varies from 2-12 weeks. When it is longer than 2 weeks, it may consist of supervised yoga training for 2 weeks followed by continuation of yoga at home for the remaining duration of the treatment. At the end of the period of treatment, the parameters are recorded again. Then, the control group is given training in yoga, except for those members of the group who do not want it.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Training in Yoga:</span> Ideally, yoga is a 24-hour activity. It consists of a few hours of yogic practices which keep a person physically fit, mentally alert, emotionally stable and spiritually oriented. The remaining part of the day is spent in giving a new colour and motive to everyday activities. At the other extreme, training in yoga may consist of a few yogic practices which the subjects practice mechanically. A compromise between the two is to teach the patients not only a wide variety of techniques such as asanas, pranayamas, kriyas and meditation, but also to give them a few talks on the philosophy of yoga, the place of yoga in daily life, the application of yoga in stress management, and to involve them in a few sessions of devotional music and socially useful work. Apart from giving the participants a truer picture of <a name="page157"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">157</span></span>yoga, this type of comprehensive approach to yoga also gives better results because it takes into account the totality of man. Man consists of not just the body which breathes, but also the mind, intellect, and his divine essence (often called the soul). All these components or layers of man (the <span class="italic">panchakoshas,</span> in yogic terminology) are interrelated. Acting on any one layer influences the other layers. An integrated and comprehensive training in yoga has various components which affect predominantly one or the other layer. For example, asanas and kriyas affect predominantly the body, pranayamas act as a bridge between the body and the mind, meditation and devotional music affect the mind, and lectures act at the level of the intellect. The whole package put together along with the socially useful work creates an opening towards the divine essence. Administering such an integrated package is not unpractical: it is being done at Swami Vivekananda Kendra (Prashanti Kuteeram), near Bangalore, at Sri Aurobindo Ashram–Delhi Branch, as well as at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, in the form of structured courses (Nagarathna and Nagendra 2004, Bijlani 2004).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">End-points:</span> The end-points should be carefully selected because the conventional treatment may be quite effective; nothing can bring down the blood glucose of a diabetic as predictably and dramatically as insulin. Therefore, in addition to efficacy <span class="italic">per se,</span> the end-points may also include the side-effects of treatment, subjective well-being, change in anxiety or stress levels, the variety and dose of medication required, effect on sequelae of the disease (e.g. complications of diabetes), effect on the basic pathology (e.g. degree of stenosis of coronary arteries), the cost of treatment, and the acceptability of treatment. Thus a holistic treatment like yoga may be considered better than the conventional treatment if it can achieve similar efficacy with less side effects, less medication, and at a lower cost.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch11lev3sec6"><h3 class="title">Questions Raised by an RCT on Yoga</h3>
<p class="noindent">Assuming that an RCT demonstrates clearly the efficacy of yoga, two questions are often raised: first, which component of the intervention is primarily responsible for its efficacy; and second, the mechanism by which the intervention works.</p>
<p class="indent">The first question is somewhat inappropriate because different components of a holistic treatment act synergistically. Each component <a name="page158"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">158</span></span>may contribute to the effect of the treatment, but the effect of all the components may be greater than the arithmetical sum of their individual contributions. Part of the effect may come from the pleasant surroundings or smiling faces of the therapists, and may be considered a placebo effect. But from the practical standpoint, that does not matter. There is no harm if some therapeutic benefit can be obtained from such simple, harmless interventions, the side effects of which are also all desirable (e.g. reduction in anxiety, or growth of love and compassion).</p>
<p class="indent">The second question is of great academic interest. The general mechanisms are in terms of restoration of a healthy autonomic balance, and immunoenhancement through the psychoneuroimmune axis. But there may be other general mechanisms yet to be discovered. Further, there may also be some mechanisms specific to the disease in question (e.g. upregulation of insulin receptors in diabetes). These questions are very interesting and exciting, but general guidelines for experimental protocols designed to answer them are difficult to formulate. These questions invariably take us towards basic studies on physiological effects of yoga.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div><div class="section" id="ch11lev1sec3"><h1 class="title">RESEARCH ON CONSCIOUSNESS</h1>
<p class="noindent">Consciousness is a confusing word because it is used in at least two different ways. Consciousness, as used in neurosciences, is spelt with a small ‘c’ and means awareness of sensory stimuli. The sum-total of all sensory inputs creates a picture of reality for us, which is called consciousness. When no sensory input is perceived, and therefore the person does not respond to sensory stimuli, we say that the person has lost consciousness. Consciousness, as used in spiritual literature, is spelt with a capital ‘C’, and refers to the nameless and formless infinite power, of which the universe is a partial manifestation. One way of looking at yoga is as a process for the growth or ascent of human consciousness so that it approaches, and finally realizes Consciousness. When the stage of realization of Consciousness has been reached, Consciousness is no longer a theoretical concept, but has become real to the person. Now this person has two pictures of reality. One is the Absolute Reality, which is changeless and permanent; the other is the empirical (or phenomenal) reality, which is based on sensory input. Empirical reality (finite) is a part of the Absolute Reality (infinite). The consciousness of a person who is constantly aware of both realities has risen from consciousness to <a name="page159"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">159</span></span>Consciousness.<sup><a href="#ch11fn8" class="ulink-inter">8</a></sup> There are several stages between these two widely separated levels of consciousness. Since yoga takes a person from consciousness towards Consciousness, research on the effects of yoga should be able to measure how much progress has been made on this journey. Herein lies a basic contradiction. Science is based on measurements made by using sensory inputs. How can sense organs measure the ability of a person to perceive a reality which is not based on sensory inputs? There is no way we can say that the consciousness of a person has grown by x cm or y kg. Growth or ascent of consciousness is a process which cannot be quantified. This is a basic limitation which needs to be understood in all research on consciousness. Even more important is to understand that consciousness has at least two widely different meanings.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch11lev2sec3"><h2 class="title">The Response of Science</h2>
<p class="noindent">Science, rather scientists, have responded to the limitations of science in three ways, which we shall examine one by one.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch11lev3sec7"><h3 class="title">The Phenomenon Does not Exist</h3>
<p class="noindent">This response reflects the arrogance of science, and is most unscientific. One of the principles of science is not to be dogmatic, to be open to new knowledge, never to consider our present state of knowledge to be the boundary of knowledge itself. Our inability to study a phenomenon does not mean that the phenomenon does not exist. Science is committed to base itself on observations. But observation need not be restricted to observations made on the outer world using the sense organs. Directing the attention inwards yields observations which do not depend on sensory inputs. But these observations are genuine and verifiable. Experimental verification of somebody else's observations requires that we use the same methods. If a scientist reports a phenomenon based on observations made with a microscope, we cannot say that the phenomenon does not exist because we have been unable to verify it with the naked eye. The methods used by yogis for rising in consciousness consist of extreme degrees of self-purification and intense concentration. Although these methods are available to all at no financial cost, very few have been willing to use these methods at any given place during any period in history.</p>
<p class="">_____________</p>
<p class="noindent"><sup class="footnote" id="ch11fn8">[<a href="#d1e8344">34</a>]</sup></p>
<p class="noindent"><a name="page160"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">160</span></span>But over thousands of years, there have been enough verifications by yogis, rishis and mystics in different parts of the world in a variety of religious and spiritual traditions to constitute a proof of sorts that there is an extrasensory route to knowledge, that the Absolute Reality can be perceived only by the extrasensory route, and that such a Reality exists (Huxley, 2004). However, several scientists consider the observations of mystics to be hallucinations (Feynman, 1992). The limitation of the spiritual experiments is that they cannot be demonstrated to others. Since the observations are extrasensory, the only person who can attest their validity is the observer himself: he cannot make the phenomenon available for sensory perception by others.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch11lev3sec8"><h3 class="title">Let Us Study it Anyhow</h3>
<p class="noindent">This is the second response of science to the study of Consciousness, as understood in yoga, mysticism and spiritual philosophy. The studies are made on yogis, monks and nuns; or on ‘meditators’. The end points are those which can be studied with the help of scientific tools such as electroencephalography (EEG), and brain imaging using positron emission tomography (PET), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) or magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). There is no harm in doing such research so long as it is understood that it examines only the observable or measurable correlates of a phenomenon which is beyond measurement. The gap between the phenomenon and the objective measurements is so vast that even the most sophisticated research manages to merely scratch the surface. Unfortunately this limitation is not always acknowledged – neither by the scientists nor the yoga ‘experts’. Several scientists work under the impression that they are studying Consciousness, and the yoga ‘experts’ claim that science has now proven that Consciousness exists. Top scientists, who understand what they are talking about, have never made such claims. Fritjof Capra, the author of <span class="italic">The Tao of Physics,</span> has only drawn parallels between mysticism and modern physics. Andrew Newberg and Eugene d'Aquili, authors of the book with the tantalizing title, <span class="italic">Why God Will Not Go Away,</span> have made <span class="italic">no claims</span> that their experiments have proven the existence of God. All what they say is that their observations are not inconsistent with the existence of a supraphysical reality. In view of the limitations of science, this is as far as science can go. As for yoga ‘experts’, they should also perceive the situation clearly instead of twisting the outcome of scientific experiments to pronounce scientific support for the existence of <a name="page161"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">161</span></span>Consciousness. Such statements leave them neither here nor there. Top scientists ridicule them for dabbling in pseudo-science. Enlightened spiritualists also ridicule them for knocking at the wrong door. Science deals with only part of the Reality, spirituality with the Whole. The Whole does not need its existence to be proven by its part.</p>
<p class="indent">In short, while in our age of science, some scientific studies on Consciousness will go on, we need to be clear about their limitations. No amount of dissection of the bulb can prove the existence of electricity. In the same way, no study of the brain can prove the existence of Consciousness. As Sri Aurobindo has said, brain is the utilizer of Consciousness, not the generator of Consciousness (Aurobindo, 1970).</p>

<p class="noindent">The majority of neuroscientists take the view that science should restrict itself to that which falls within its framework. They are quite content to work on consciousness, and leave Consciousness to the philosophers and mystics. This is a perfectly valid approach, and is in keeping with the Cartesian division between matter and spirit which has guided modern science for more than 300 years. However, there is one area of ignorance which neurosciences cannot get rid of even in the study of consciousness. This difficulty comes up in both sensory and motor neurophysiology. A <span class="italic">sensory</span> stimulus is coded in terms of the electro-chemical language of the nervous system, and finally reaches the cerebral cortex. The activation of a set of neurons in the cerebral cortex is followed by conscious perception (awareness) of the stimulus. Activation of neurons is an observable physical phenomenon with electrical (propagation of action potentials) and chemical (release of neurotransmitters) correlates. These physical processes can be detected and measured by scientific methods. On the other hand, the conscious perception of a stimulus is a non-physical subjective phenomenon. How the activation of neurons (a physical phenomenon) leads to conscious perception (a non-physical phenomenon) is something science has neither been able to explain, nor perhaps will ever be able to. The ignorance is generally covered up in a lot of words, but there is really no answer to this question. In the <span class="italic">motor</span> nervous system, all voluntary actions begin with a thought (e.g. I want to write), and are followed by activation of a set of neurons (e.g. those which will eventually lead to contraction of muscles required for lifting up a pen). How the thought (a non-physical or non-material <a name="page162"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">162</span></span>entity) leads to activation of neurons in the premotor and motor context (a physical phenomenon) is again a question science cannot answer. The reason why science cannot answer these basic questions is that bridging the gap between the material and the non-material requires the intuition of the mystic. Or, to use Deepak Chopra's language, it requires a quantum leap in consciousness similar to that achieved by the mystics. It is this spectacular growth of consciousness that enables a mystic to visualize how non-material Consciousness can manifest as the material universe. A similar transmutation in the mode of consciousness takes place on a miniature scale when neuronal activity manifests as a sensory experience, or a thought manifests as neuronal activity. Therefore, to understand this transmutation, a leap in consciousness similar to that achieved by mystics is required. Alternatively, it warrants a hypothesis based on atomic physics. But conventional neurosciences are certainly incompetent to handle this transmutation which is an inseparable accompaniment of mental function.</p>

<p class="noindent">Daniel Benor defines spiritual healing as intentional influence of one or more people upon another living system without utilizing any known physical means of intervention (Benor 1990). This includes distance healing, pranic healing and intercessory prayer. The studies may be done on animals, bacteria, cell or tissue cultures, or enzyme systems. Rigorously designed controlled studies can be more easily done on these non-human systems, and have frequently given positive results. Larry Dossey and Michael Miovic have reviewed the literature on such studies, also called non-local studies because the ‘healer’ and the system he is trying to influence are not in physical contact, or in other words, are separated by a distance (Dossey 1999, Miovic 2003). They have cited studies demonstrating people's ability to influence successfully animate as well as inanimate systems at a distance by visualizing, imagining, willing, or otherwise wishing for specific outcomes. For example, the ‘healer’ may try to use the force of his intention for slowing down the proliferation of cancer cells in a cell culture system, or the division of bacterial cells in a petri dish. The fact that the intention may be successful is consistent with the quantum theory as well as with the spiritual view of an all pervasive unified Consciousness.<a name="page163"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">163</span></span></p>
<div class="section" id="ch11lev2sec4"><h2 class="title">Research on Intercessory Prayer</h2>
<p class="noindent">Randolph Byrd published in 1988 a study on patients in the coronary care unit (Byrd 1988). It was a randomized, double-blind controlled trial. For the experimental group (n = 192), prayers were offered by a group of volunteers. The investigators did not arrange any volunteers to pray for the control group (n = 201). The prayed-for patients needed less antibiotics, needed endotracheal intubation less often, and had a lower incidence of pulmonary edema than the control patients. The study was blinded: the prayed-for patients did not know that they were being prayed for, the investigators did not know which patients were being prayed-for, and the volunteers did not know whom they were praying for. The outcome of the study, although only weakly positive, created a flutter in scientific circles as well as the lay press. The study was followed up by a more extensive study by another group with similar results (Harris et al 1999). While these studies are rigorously designed and seem to be flawless, they have some unavoidable pitfalls.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch11lev3sec10"><h3 class="title">Pitfalls in Controlled Studies on Intercessory Prayer</h3>
<p class="noindent">The double-blind randomized controlled trial is almost ideal for examining the efficacy of a pill, but that does not make it satisfactory also for examining the efficacy of prayer. Apart from the impossibility of having a placebo for prayer, there are several other flaws in such studies. For instance, it is neither feasible nor ethical in either group to prevent the patients from praying, and to prevent their relatives and friends from praying for them. The result therefore is that in the control group also, the patient + his friends (X) may be praying. In the experimental group, the patient + his friends (Y) may be praying, and in addition, volunteers arranged without the patient's knowledge (N) are praying. It is possible that, at least for some patients, X may be greater than Y+N. Assuming, however, that the number of prayers offered for patients in the experimental group is greater than for those in the control group, can we expect the effect of prayer to be proportional to the number of prayers offered? Do the prayers have a dose-response relationship like the pills, or would the efficacy of prayer depend on its intensity and sincerity? Can the intensity and sincerity of a prayer be measured or standardized like the strength of a pill? Further, is one prayer offered by an ordinary person equivalent to one prayer offered by a holy person? These are questions <a name="page164"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">164</span></span>which are very valid but impossible to answer. Finally, the outcome is considered favourable if the patient survives. Leave alone God's inscrutable logic, even from the human angle it is doubtful if prolongation of life is necessarily the best outcome in all situations. These are the insurmountable problems which led a group of scientists to conclude, after several rounds of discussion, that a flawless study on the healing efficacy of prayer cannot be done (Chibnall 2001).<sup><a href="#ch11fn9" class="ulink-inter">9</a></sup></p>

<div class="section" id="ch11lev2sec5"><h2 class="title">Closing Thoughts</h2>
<p class="noindent">This chapter has concentrated on methodological issues concerning some topics relevant to medicine but not clearly amenable to scientific research. It is important to combine an open mind with a critical insight while dealing with research on these subjects because such research is currently gaining in popularity. In the process, science is stretching its limits. That is not bad in itself, but it would be prudent to hasten slowly.</p>
