It seems that everything that could be discovered by using equipment fabricated by the investigator himself from junk has already been discovered. Most worthwhile research needs these days resources which are far beyond the capacity of an individual. Therefore, one has to apply for research grants. Making a good research grant application is an art. However, that does not mean that the application need not have substance. Substance and style are both important for success.</p><div class="section" id="ch12lev1sec1"><h1 class="title">THE RESEARCH GRANT APPLICATION</h1>
<p class="noindent">Every funding agency has a prescribed format in which the application has to be made. Getting the latest version of instructions for making the application is necessary: it saves time while writing the application. It is better not to depend on an old version which may be available with a friend because funding agencies revise these documents periodically.</p>
<p class="">_____________</p>
<p class="noindent"><sup class="footnote" id="ch12fn1">[<a href="#d1e8680">36</a>]</sup></p>
<p class="noindent"><a name="page167"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">167</span></span>The latest version may be downloaded from the website of the funding agency. The format of the application may have three sections, and a total of more than a dozen headings under these sections. But irrespective of the format, every research grant application asks six basic questions. The first three questions are the why, what and how of the project, i.e. the same questions which one answers while planning any research (<a href="/9788184484175/chapter/ch3" class="ulink-exter">Chapter 3</a>). The next three questions ask whether the project is important, whether the investigator will be able to do the research, and what the investigator wants for doing the research. Now we shall discuss these six questions especially from the point of view of a research grant application.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch12lev2sec1"><h2 class="title">Why?</h2>
<p class="noindent">In order to spell out why an investigator wants to do something, he should give the present state of knowledge as well as ignorance regarding the topic. This section is important, but the commonest pitfall here is that most applicants make the <span class="italic">review of literature</span> very long. The aim of the literature survey in a research grant application is not to educate the referee; the aim is only to bring out the rationale for the proposed research. Therefore, the review should begin very close to the point where the known meets the unknown so that the write-up can quickly reach the limits of what is known, and hence the need for further exploration. If the proposed research is an extension of previous work done by the applicant, the previous studies could be the starting point. However, enough of related work by other investigators should also be cited in order to place the work in a broader context.<sup><a href="#ch12fn2" class="ulink-inter">2</a></sup> Then the review should quickly move to the work being proposed, and point out that such work has not been attempted by other investigators in the field, and that the work is important. In some research projects, the work may not be directed at finding out something unknown but rather at resolving a controversy. In that case both sides of the controversy should be briefly stated with adequate references, and the need for resolving the controversy should be clearly brought out.</p>
<p class="indent">Bringing out the lacuna which has prompted the research proposal is so important that it may be summarized under the subheading ‘rationale of the study’ at the end of the review of literature, even if the format of the funding agency does not include such a subheading.</p>
<p class="">_____________</p>
<p class="noindent"><sup class="footnote" id="ch12fn2">[<a href="#d1e8714">37</a>]</sup></p>
<p class="noindent"><a name="page168"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">168</span></span>In addition, the lacuna(e) also invariably get woven into the ‘objectives of the project’, and must also form the first one or two sentences of the ‘summary of the project’.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch12lev2sec2"><h2 class="title">What?</h2>
<p class="noindent">This section tells the reader exactly what the investigator proposes to do. Although brief, this section is of vital importance. It should be clear, concise and realistic. The backbone of this section are the <span class="italic">aims and objectives</span> of the project, which should be enumerated and prioritized.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch12lev2sec3"><h2 class="title">How?</h2>
<p class="noindent">This is the <span class="italic">methods</span> section of the project and describes how the project will be carried out. This section has, broadly speaking, four parts. The first part gives details of the subjects/species/tissue to be used and the sample size. The second part gives the experimental design, including the outcome measures. This is a crucial part, which should receive the maximum possible thought and attention. The design should be that which is most appropriate for the project under consideration. A statistician should be consulted, and the issue discussed with colleagues to arrive at the best design. These two parts of the ‘methods’ are always read carefully by the reviewers, and are strong determinants of the decision regarding the funding of the project. The next two parts should also be written in detail, although they may be only glanced through rather than read by the referees. The paradox is that if they have been given in detail, they are not read; but if they are sketchy, the defect is pointed out and may become one of the reasons for rejection! This paradox is particularly true of the third part which deals with the techniques that will be used for making the measurements. These may run into several pages, and the reviewer does not gain much by reading them, but it is only by their presence in the project that the reviewer knows that the investigator knows the techniques (hopefully!).<sup><a href="#ch12fn3" class="ulink-inter">3</a></sup> The fourth part deals with the statistical methods and software that will be used for the analysis of the data. A statistician must be consulted for writing this part too. Advances in statistics have made this part beyond the competence of most scientists to handle entirely on their own.</p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="ch12lev2sec4"><h2 class="title">Is it Important?</h2>
<p class="noindent">It is not enough that the investigator wishes to study something that has not been studied earlier; what he wishes to study should also be important. This question has several aspects. First, is the likely outcome of the project scientifically important, i.e. does it have academic merit? In other words, will the new information gained from the project add something significant to the existing scientific knowledge on the subject? Secondly, in medical research, it is desirable to know whether the project is clinically important. Is the outcome of the project likely to influence clinical practice? Will it help prevent a disease? Will it provide a new diagnostic tool? Will it provide or validate a new modality of treatment? In short, is the outcome of the project likely to find application in scientific medicine? Thirdly, is the project relevant to national problems? In developing countries, it is considered especially important that the limited resources available should be spent preferably on solving local problems. For example, in India a project on tuberculosis may be considered more important than one on multiple sclerosis. Finally, does the subject fit into the priority areas earmarked by the funding agency for support? The funding agencies frequently identify a few areas for preferential support: the selection consists of problems perceived by a group of top scientists to be pressing for urgent solution.</p>
<p class="indent">While writing the section on importance of the project, calculated optimism and a little exaggeration are quite an accepted norm. Having said that, it is important to realize that hardly any project would be important from every angle. A clinical trial might be important from the point of view of application but may be academically bland. On the other hand, an exciting basic science project might have great academic value but its application may be nowhere in sight. Therefore, even the section on the importance of the project should be basically honest. There is no need to bend over backwards to justify the project as scientifically significant, clinically important as well as nationally relevant.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch12lev2sec5"><h2 class="title">Can He Do it?</h2>
<p class="noindent">The project may be good, but the funding agency also wants to judge, as far as possible, whether the investigator will be able to deliver the goods. This question has two aspects. <span class="italic">First,</span> does the investigator have the necessary expertise and training for carrying out the project? This can be assessed from the biodata of the investigator, which is <a name="page170"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">170</span></span>generally one of the items asked as a part of the application. It is not essential that the principal investigator should be an expert in all the techniques to be used for the research. Nobody knows everything. That is one reason why there are co-investigators. If all the investigators put together can do everything required, that is quite enough. <span class="italic">Second,</span> does the institution where the work will be done have the necessary facilities? The investigator may have the expertise, but if he does not have the equipment available, he will still be unable to do the research. The funding agencies generally do not give money for all the equipment required for the project. If most of the equipment is already available with the investigators, one or two missing pieces may be sanctioned for the project under consideration. This raises a legitimate question: how can a scientist acquire the first few pieces of equipment? The answer is that there are principally two ways to begin: with institutional funds, or by joining an established lab. Well-funded institutes which give high priority to research encourage beginners by giving ‘seed money’. Secondly, such institutes might have centralized labs where commonly used equipment is available for general use. Thirdly, such institutes might also give money to their senior scientists for very expensive equipment (e.g. a confocal microscope) which is generally not possible to buy from research grants. Therefore, the easiest way to begin is to join an established laboratory in a well-funded institute. To make a beginning one may also tap the special schemes for young investigators which many funding agencies now have. Once a beginning has been made, no matter how, it is easy to add one or two pieces of equipment through each grant. That is how most of the good labs grow and also replace obsolete equipment.</p>
<p class="indent">The research grant application generally includes an item on ‘facilities available’. Under this heading one should describe the space, equipment, animal house, patients, healthy subjects, etc. to which the investigators have easy access.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch12lev2sec6"><h2 class="title">What Does He Want?</h2>
<p class="noindent">This question is answered in the section customarily called the ‘Budget’. The budget generally has four or five parts. The first item usually asks for the personnel to be employed in the project, and the expenditure likely to be incurred on them. In order to arrive at a good estimate, it is important to find out the latest scales of emolument for different categories of research staff (<a href="#ch12fig1" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 12.1</a>).<a name="page171"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">171</span></span></p>
<div class="figure" id="ch12fig1" data-label="Fig. 12.1"><div class="title"><span class="item-label">Fig. 12.1</span> The life of a scientist is not a bed of roses. <span class="italic">(Modified from a cartoon by Sunny Dutta Gupta, AIIMS)</span></div><img alt="Fig. 12.1" src="/MediumImage/171-1.jpg"><div class="additional-markup"></div></div>
<p class="noindent"><a name="page172"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">172</span></span>The next item of the budget consists of the equipment required from the research grant. The next item lists the glassware and chemicals (‘consumables’) required for the project and their cost. Some agencies might ask for the foreign exchange component (FEC) in the expenditure on equipment or consumables. Next, one may list miscellaneous items not covered under the previous heads, such as the expenditure on books, journals, stationery, software, photocopying, postage, transport and travel. Travel generally refers to the journeys that might be made to present the results of the research at professional meetings. Finally, the budget also includes justification for the personnel and equipment, and also for other major items included in the budget.</p>
<p class="indent">Money is not the only resource a research worker needs: he also needs time. That is why funding agencies also ask for the duration of the project, and sometimes also for a ‘timeline’ or Programme Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT) chart. This should be realistic: work generally takes longer than expected. Getting the staff, equipment and chemicals may take a lot of time even if money is available. One should commit to only what can be actually done in the duration of the project (usually 3 years or less): there is no penalty for doing more than what one is committed to do. Sometimes projects received by funding agencies promise in 3 years work that might take a lifetime to complete. On the other hand, some projects promise very little work (e.g. a simple study on 20 patients having a common disease) and ask 3 years for it. In such cases the funding agency might increase the sample size and reduce the duration.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch12lev2sec7"><h2 class="title">Ethical Clearance</h2>
<p class="noindent">Although ethical clearance is not a very conspicuous part of a research grant application, the project may not be sanctioned, or it may not be possible to start the work, unless clearance by an appropriate Ethics Committee is available. Therefore, it is prudent to submit the project simultaneously to the funding agency and the Ethics Committee, and mention in the grant application that the protocol of the study has been submitted to an appropriate authority for approval from the ethical angle. The funding agency would take time, and the Ethics Committee would also take time to process the application. If the approval of the Ethics Committee is received earlier (which is generally the case), a photocopy of the letter of approval should be sent to the funding agency for being kept in the file dealing with the project.<a name="page173"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">173</span></span></p>
</div>
</div><div class="section" id="ch12lev1sec2"><h1 class="title">WHAT HAPPENS TO THE RESEARCH GRANT APPLICATION?</h1>
<p class="noindent">No matter how good the research proposal, one should not expect a cheque for the amount requested by return mail. One should be quite content to receive within a month an acknowledgement stating that the proposal is under consideration. Funding agencies have a procedure for deciding whether or not to fund a project and the procedure may take up to a year. Some agencies sometimes take much longer, but those cases call for some introspection on the part of the funding agency. The procedure for screening applications may include one or more of the components discussed below.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch12lev2sec8"><h2 class="title">Expert Review</h2>
<p class="noindent">The project may be sent to one or more experts for review. The experts for this purpose are those who have worked in the same or a related area of research. Experts are busy, and reviewing a project is time-consuming business. Further, not one, but a pile of ten or more projects might land on the expert's table at the same time. That is why brevity, clarity and precision are important, and so is a presentation which highlights what is really important, viz. the rationale, the objectives, the experimental design, and the significance of the project. The comments of the expert are rarely in the form of a verdict, but may set the tone for a verdict. They point out the positive and negative features of the project, and may include suggestions for improving the project, e.g. increasing the sample size, asking one more question from the study, including one more control group, or adding one or two more outcome measures.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch12lev2sec9"><h2 class="title">Review by a Committee</h2>
<p class="noindent">Funding agencies have several standing project review committees in different areas of research. The committees include a few external experts, one or two internal experts, and one or two administrators. Each committee meets periodically to consider the projects that have been received since the last meeting. The members of the committee might be sent all or some of the projects to be considered at the meeting a few weeks in advance so that they have an opportunity to scrutinize the projects thoroughly. During the meeting, the committee might also have the benefit of written comments from experts who are not present at the meeting. All these things help because the time available during the meeting is very short. The committee might have to examine as many as fifty projects during each day of the meeting.<a name="page174"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">174</span></span></p>
<p class="indent">Many funding agencies also invite the applicants to the project review group meeting. At the meeting, the applicant is expected to make a short (about 10-minute) presentation on the project, and to answer questions about the project. This is a very efficient way of giving a good idea about the projects to each member of the committee. Many doubts can also be clarified on the spot, thereby saving much time on correspondence.</p>
<p class="indent">However, even if the funding agency follows this practice, the applicants should not relax on the care they take while submitting the written project in the hope that they will have an opportunity to clarify things further during the oral presentation. A poorly written project has poor chances of getting funded even if the presentation is good. A remark such as “But this is not what your project says” or “Then why didn't you put it down in the project” from one of the members of the committee is enough to tilt the balance against the project.</p>
<p class="indent">Meetings at which applicants present their projects, and also some investigators with on-going projects present the progress their projects have made, are an excellent educational opportunity for all present. So much of what is learnt from the presentations made by others can be useful in our own work. Many bright ideas for future work are also born at these meetings.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch12lev2sec10"><h2 class="title">Site Visit</h2>
<p class="noindent">Instead of, or, more often, in addition to, the above types of review, the funding agency might arrange a visit to the applicant's laboratory. The site visit is meant to elicit information that cannot be obtained from a written project, through correspondence, or even in an oral presentation to the project review group. Site visits usually accompany the review of very high-budget projects, or applications for establishment of a unit or centre for advanced research in a broad area. Applications for units or centres are made by (or invited from) established research groups which have shown a decade or more of sustained interest, high productivity and good quality in their research on a single topic. Such a group can benefit from generous funding for 5-10 years at a stretch which they can use in a relatively flexible manner on a large number of interrelated research projects. The members of the group which makes the site visit are likely to be a sub-group of the project review committee, comprising of a few scientists and an administrator. Site visit is a positive sign in that the funding agency would not arrange it unless all the other methods of review have been favourable. But still, one should not take the outcome of the <a name="page175"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">175</span></span>site visit for granted, and care should be taken to improve the chances of its going well.</p>
<p class="indent">The group that makes the site visit are guests, and some of them have generally been friends of the group they are visiting. Thus all arrangements for hospitality are in order. But the hospitability should not be such as to embarrass the guests, or make them feel under pressure that they have to give a favourable report. Regarding the professional part of the site visit, it would usually start with a presentation of the project by the team leader for about 30 minutes. The presentation would be followed by questions for 30-60 minutes. Next would come a visit to the laboratories, animal house, clinical facility, etc., whatever is relevant to the project and is available with the investigators. Some informal discussions with various members of the research group may also be arranged in their individual labs or offices. An informal session to talk about the previous work of the research group, papers published, awards won, etc. would also be in order. Some more unstructured informal chit-chat over tea or meals with various members of the group, specially youngsters, is also important to give the visitors a feel of the intellectual environment of the place. All this is a lot of work for a day, which is likely to be the maximum duration of a site visit. Therefore, adequate planning for the site visit is absolutely essential.</p>
<p class="indent">The report of the site visit would generally include comments on the scientific merit of the project(s) included in the proposal, adequacy of the facilities available, justification for the budget requested, and the intellectual environment of the research group.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch12lev2sec11"><h2 class="title">The Verdict</h2>
<p class="noindent">Based on the review of the project by one or more of the above methods, the funding agency sends their decision to the applicant. The verdict is ‘acceptance’, ‘rejection’ or ‘revision’. Straight acceptance of the project as it is submitted is rare. Rejection of the project is usually accompanied by the reasons for rejection (<a href="#ch12fig2" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 12.2</a>). Rejection calls for introspection, not despair. After the introspection, one should submit a better fresh proposal. By far the commonest verdict probably is that the project may be resubmitted after revision in light of the referees’ comments. This is an encouraging sign because if the revision is satisfactory, the project is usually approved.<a name="page176"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">176</span></span></p>
<div class="figure" id="ch12fig2" data-label="Fig. 12.2"><div class="title"><span class="item-label">Fig. 12.2</span> Rejection of a proposal is usually accompanied by reasons for the rejection</div><img alt="Fig. 12.2" src="/MediumImage/176-1.jpg"><div class="additional-markup"></div></div>
<a name="page177"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">177</span></span>
<div class="section" id="ch12lev3sec1"><h3 class="title">Silence</h3>
<p class="noindent">A fourth ‘response’ of the funding agency is sometimes prolonged silence (<a href="#ch12fig3" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 12.3</a>). The silence is generally due to the silence of the expert to whom the project has gone. Or, it may be that one or the other member of the project review committee is always busy so that the meeting of the group becomes impossible to fix. In such cases, the applicant should remind the funding agency, by meeting the concerned person there personally or talking to him on telephone, if possible. The funding agencies do not mind it, and moreover, it does help. It helps because there are solutions to the above problems. The erring expert can be reminded, or the project may be sent to another expert. The meeting can be organized without consulting all the members, and the absence of some members can be ignored or made up by substitutes. Reminders from investigators whose applications have been lying for a long time motivate the funding agency to come up with these solutions.</p>
<p class="indent">An unfortunate reason for the prolonged silence of the funding agency sometimes is that the project may be technically approved but funds are not available. After technical clearance, projects go to the finance division, and that is where many projects sometimes get stuck. Reminders can help overcome even this bottleneck: the project may be approved with a smaller budget, or early in the next financial year. However, it may be pointed out that this situation is not very common, and the situation in India is much better than in USA! The reason is that, at least for medical research, funding agencies find it difficult to get enough of really good applications. Therefore, every good project almost always get funded. On the other hand, the National Institute of Health (NIH) in USA get so many applications that in some divisions only about 25% get funded. The result is that over there many good projects also get rejected because of lack of funds.</p>
<p class="indent">There are several ‘tricks’ experienced investigators use to beat the inevitable delays involved in approval of research grant applications. One of them is to have two or three projects from different funding agencies running simultaneously but out of phase, e.g. one project may be for 2004-2007, another for 2005-2008 and a third one for 2006-2009. This does not need great planning – it may not be so neat, but a situation like this develops automatically with busy research groups. This situation is pretty comfortable, but that does not mean that the group should relax.<a name="page178"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">178</span></span></p>
<div class="figure" id="ch12fig3" data-label="Fig. 12.3"><div class="title"><span class="item-label">Fig. 12.3</span> The response of the funding agency to the research grant application is sometimes prolonged silence</div><img alt="Fig. 12.3" src="/MediumImage/178-1.jpg"><div class="additional-markup"></div></div>
<p class="noindent"><a name="page179"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">179</span></span>In 2006, they should be busy writing a research grant application for the agency which has funded the 2004-2007 project, in 2007, they should put in an application for a new grant to the source of the 2005-2008 grant, and so on. Along with this, they will also have to submit annual progress reports for the projects in hand. Writing progress reports is easier, and the quality of the reports also improves, if the work done is published promptly. Good progress reports are important to build up a good reputation, which in turn facilitates the funding of future projects. Thus busy research groups are always on a treadmill, writing research grant applications, papers and reports all the time, besides of course actually doing the research – they truly have never a dull moment!</p>
<p class="indent">A slightly ‘less honourable’ trick to beat the delays involved in processing of research grant applications is to not only think ahead but also work ahead. One can finish the work involved in a 3-year project by the end of the 2nd year, and start working on a new project in the 3rd year, and simultaneously also apply for funds for this new project during the third year. This helps in building up a very good reputation too, because by the time the funding for the project has been approved, the first year's progress report may be ready. In such cases, progress reports are deliberately made to lag behind the work that has been done (otherwise there may be no new work to show for the project in the third year!).</p>
<p class="indent">A ‘dishonourable’ trick which should <span class="italic">not</span> be used to reduce the waiting period for funds is to submit the same application simultaneously to more than one funding agency. The referees used by different funding agencies often have at least a few names in common. Therefore, apart from being bad in itself, this trick is also invariably found out, creates a bad impression, and may become a strong justification for all the funding agencies to reject the application.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div><div class="section" id="ch12lev1sec3"><h1 class="title">CLOSING THOUGHTS</h1>
<p class="noindent">What has been described above is the procedure for ‘ad hoc’ or unsolicited projects, that is, projects which are voluntarily submitted by the investigator. Sometimes funding agencies may themselves ask an investigator to conduct research on a specified problem. Such research is called contract research and is directed at solving a national problem which the government wants to be solved (e.g. efficacy of domiciliary treatment in tuberculosis, or study of medical problems among tsunami victims). Pharmaceutical companies may also offer money for clinical trials on their drugs. On one hand, contract research is an enviable situation – one gets money without asking for it. On the other hand, it may be something that is not academically exciting, and may be demanding in terms of asking for a clear outcome within <a name="page180"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">180</span></span>a specified time frame. Pharmaceutical firms might also exercise undue haste in the publication of results, and might highlight the benefits while downplaying the negative aspects of their drug in their publicity material based on the research. In contract research, projects move fast, but individuals feel like cogs in a giant wheel.</p>
<p class="indent">It is widely believed that many factors other than the quality of the research project are major determinants of the funding decision. These factors are collectively termed grantsmanship. Grantsmanship includes some innocuous features, which should receive some attention anyway, such as the literary elegance, quality of the paper used, the font(s) used and packaging (e.g. spiral binding vs. stapling). Grantsmanship also includes points such as cultivating friendships and building networks, finding out who the referees are, and contacting them in advance, etc. These are features, which are gossiped around in language too crude to print, and their importance is magnified to levels too difficult to believe. But my experience with funding agencies shows that no amount of grantsmanship can compensate for a poor project. On the other hand, if the project is really good, most aspects of grantsmanship cease to matter. Therefore, we should concentrate on doing a good job instead of bothering about extraneous factors. Further, let us stop wasting time on unproductive gossip blaming the importance of grantsmanship for our failure in research. Instead, let us introspect and ask ourselves if we have any really good ideas for research, or do we just want to do some sort of research for the sake of the material benefits it might bring.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, a few words on what sort of projects <span class="italic">not</span> to write. Young investigators should avoid writing highly ambitious projects, and also projects on ‘shady’ topics. A big project asking for a grant of 1 crore rupees from an investigator who is too young to show much in terms of his past achievements is unlikely to be funded, no matter how promising his academic record might be. On the other hand, a good project coming from a young investigator earns instant sympathy if it has a modest budget, and asks money only for ‘consumables’, and, may be, one or two pieces of inexpensive equipment. If the budget does not include any money for personnel, it means that the investigator will do the work with his own hands: this becomes a specially favourable feature. In fact, some funding agencies have a system for processing such applications faster than the usual ad hoc projects. All India Institute of Medical Sciences has been having for nearly thirty years a laudable scheme for its young faculty under which small annual grants (currently, about Rs.50,000) are given for ad hoc projects. These are processed locally, and therefore, the waiting period is much less. Most medical schools do not have such a provision, <a name="page181"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">181</span></span>but it may be a good idea for funding agencies also to start processing such applications locally. Funding agencies have scientists on their rolls who function as glorified administrators, essentially passing on referees’ comments to the investigators, and the investigators’ responses to the referees. It may help scientific research, and also make the job of scientists working with funding agencies more interesting if all small projects (say, asking for less than Rs.2 lac per year) are evaluated by the agency's own scientists. As a matter of policy, unless the project is clearly hopeless, all such projects should be approved, and the response should be communicated to the investigators within one month of receipt of the project. Young investigators should also avoid writing projects on ‘shady’ subjects such as ‘effects of awakening of the kundalini on the brain’ or ‘physical and physiological correlates of the subtle body’. Such projects are unlikely to get funded; moreover, the referees may doubt even the sanity of the investigator!</p>
<p class="indent">A humble ‘don't’ also for senior investigators. Some senior scientists, retired or on the verge of retirement, get into a megalomaniac mood and submit ridiculous ‘projects’. For example, establishing a centre for research in molecular biology is a proposal for an institute, not a research project. Or, a project on ‘nutritional problems associated with aging’ is a topic for an essay, not a research project. When a senior scientist submits such a proposal and includes in the budget money for staff, a few computers, air conditioners and refrigerators, a Xerox machine, a telephone connection, and a car, it does not take long for anyone who scans the application to see that the primary purpose of the project is to build an empire in which the scientist will continue to find employment and a comfortable environment even after retirement. It speaks a lot for the robustness of the system that most such proposals get rejected. But networking occasionally leads to the approval of even such monstrosities. About the outcome of these projects, the less said the better. What the scientists need to ask themselves is whether this is the type of ‘research’ on which the poor tax-payer's money should be spent.</p>

<p class="aligncenter"><bold>ANSWERS AND SOLUTIONS</bold></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p class="">The title should be a concise statement of <span class="italic">what</span> the investigators propose to do. Apart from giving the reviewer this vital information in very few words, the title also helps the funding agency in sending the project to the right division and the right referees.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Most research grant applications ask for a 100-200 word summary, sometimes with key words. The summary should give the rationale (why) of the study in one, or at the most two short sentences. Most of the words allowed in the summary should be used for describing what will be done. Here the experimental design, the species to be used and the outcome measures are the most important. Summary is not the place to write whether a particular measurement will be made by radioimmunoassay or by ELISA, and the names of the statistical tests or the software that will be used for analysis of data. The summary should end with two to three short sentences on the importance of the project.</p></li>
<li><p class="">No doubt it does, because money is easier to get for certain areas of study, and certain type of projects. However, having said that it may be added that academic freedom is a value which it is fashionable to cherish and feel superior about, but most of us would not know what to do with it if more of it were available. One may expect young people to be brimming over with brilliant but unworkable ideas. I sometimes ask them the hypothetical question, “Suppose money is no problem. You can get any amount of money, any equipment, and any facility you want. You just have to ask for it and you will get it. In such a situation, what would be your dream project?” The response is usually silence or some worthless half-baked idea which has been fabricated on the spot. I don't think senior people would do much better. Coming back to ground realities, it is easiest to get money for ‘safe’ research. Safe research is on common, locally relevant problems and is likely to lead to a clear outcome and publishable results in a limited period of time. This effectively rules out novel and risky ideas, a few of which might lead to breakthroughs. A trick for overcoming the situation is to get money for safe research, and use a small part of it for exciting but unsafe research. If preliminary work on the unsafe ideas is encouraging, it can be written up as a research grant application, and the application could include the preliminary results.</p></li>
