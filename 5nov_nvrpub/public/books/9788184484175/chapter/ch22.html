He has the licence to give shots of opium and deprive people of their appendices and tonsils. At parties, people much older than himself ask for his advice. He is regaled with case histories of doctors having made fortunes. Members of his fraternity are worshipped almost like gods. That is the obverse. Now let us have a look at the reverse. A fresh medical graduate is shaky in his diagnosis and feels panicky in an emergency. He would much rather have the nurse ‘set up the i.v.’, and is sure that a barber's bandage would be better than his. In his own country, he faces the prospects of unemployment. Abroad, he is no longer wanted. He feels like a starving man in possession of a precious stone that can neither be encashed nor eaten. In this paradoxical situation, the big question for a fresh medical graduate is, “What next?”</p><p class="indent">Medicine offers unique opportunities for service. No matter whether one wants to serve oneself, serve mankind, or serve the cause of science, the medical profession has the potential for providing the zenith of fulfillment (<a href="#ch22fig1" class="ulink-inter">Fig. App.II.1</a>). But one cannot hope for fulfillment in all the three spheres; a choice is inevitable. The choice is made difficult by the fact that the situation does not permit much compromise – choosing any one is invariably at the expense of the other two. Such a black and white situation does not suit the grey human temperament. While everybody wants to alleviate suffering, only hypocrisy makes doctors treat money as if it were poisonous. While everybody wants to make money, few would like to be deliberately callous or casual towards fellow beings in pain. Money versus mankind is a constant question faced by a doctor. If serving the cause of science looks like an escape from this conflict, it becomes apparent quite soon that it is not so. The world of a doctor, in the eyes of the society, involves an enviable combination – the satisfaction of alleviating misery, and the satisfaction of rolling in money.<sup><a href="#ch22bib1" class="ulink-inter">1</a></sup> Choosing science as a career implies sacrificing both the components of this twin satisfaction. And the bargain leads to gains that are abstract, inapparent and dubious. Secondly, opportunities for research in medical sciences are extremely limited and can accommodate only a small fraction of graduating physicians. Finally, the minimum abilities required for a research career are probably higher than those required for practising medicine. Thus choosing academics is not an escape route, but an alternative journey to be embarked upon only after a thorough assessment of one's ambitions and abilities. When a person graduates in medicine, he is generally under twenty five.<a name="page299"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">299</span></span></p><div class="figure" id="ch22fig1" data-label="Fig. App.II.1"><div class="title"><span class="item-label">Fig. App.II.1</span> Medicine offers the zenith of fulfillment in at least three widely different spheres. But fulfillment in any one sphere is invariably at the expense of the other two</div><img alt="Fig. App.II.1" src="/MediumImage/299-1.jpg"><div class="additional-markup"></div></div><p class="noindent">It is still too early for him to define his goal – clearly, comfortably, and confidently.<sup><a href="#ch22fn1" class="ulink-inter">*</a></sup> He is made further panicky by the hurry in which he has to take an important decision with an impact that will last a lifetime. The period generally available for this decision is the year of internship. The freedom of choice available is immense. The avenues open are almost infinite. But a choice has got to be made. Further, it has to be a fairly narrow choice. And finally, the choice is, for all practical purposes, irreversible. That is the dilemma of a fresh medical graduate.</p><p class="indent">Although the problem is complex, its resolution ultimately rests on the graduate himself. To start with, he should ask himself what he really wants from life, and answer the question with total honesty. If he decides in favour of money, or the service of mankind, generally there is not much of a problem. For making money, private practice, or going abroad (perhaps to the Middle East) are the routes of choice. Even more money can be made still faster by having a clinic exclusively for rather dubious procedures, such as abortions and hymenoplasty. For serving mankind, working in a rural community offers the best opportunities. A dedicated graduate can easily get entrenched into the community, not as a mere doctor, but rather as a respected and enlightened member of the society who will be looked upon as a guide and counselor for every walk of life. Most fresh graduates, however, want some compromise between these two extremes. In that case, a postgraduate degree in a clinical subject is quite essential.</p><p class="">_________________</p><p class="noindent"><sup class="footnote" id="ch22fn1">[<a href="#d1e13317">57</a>]</sup></p><p class="noindent"><a name="page300"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">300</span></span>Perhaps that is what makes postgraduation the commonest choice.<sup><a href="#ch22fn2" class="ulink-inter">**</a></sup> That gives another three years for making the final choice, and also opens the door to the most-desired jobs.<sup><a href="#ch22fn3" class="ulink-inter">***</a></sup> If the choice is for an academic career in a basic medical subject, the graduate must make doubly sure that he will really not miss the wealth and worship that are within his reach as a doctor.</p><p class="indent">The satisfactory resolution of the dilemma of a fresh medical graduate largely depends on a correct matching of his ambitions, abilities and opportunities (<a href="#ch22fig2" class="ulink-inter">Fig. AppII.2</a>). Gross mismatching makes a person either disgruntled or frustrated. The most contented and happy people are those with average abilities who harbour average ambitions. They are generally able to soon create a niche for themselves. They keep their body comfortable by living a decent life, they keep their conscience clear by relieving the misery of many, and they are not haunted by the quest for a Nobel Prize.</p><p class="indent">P.S. The use of exclusively male pronouns while referring to the fresh medical graduate in the above essay is purely for convenience and not an expression of a male chauvinistic attitude.</p><p class="">_________________</p><p class="noindent"><sup class="footnote" id="ch22fn2">[<a href="#d1e13363">58</a>]</sup></p><p class="noindent"><sup class="footnote" id="ch22fn3">[<a href="#d1e13374">59</a>]</sup></p><p class="">_________________</p><p class="noindent"><sup class="footnote" id="ch22fn4">[<a href="#d1e13388">60</a>]</sup></p><a name="page301"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">301</span></span><div class="figure" id="ch22fig2" data-label="Fig. App.II.2"><div class="title"><span class="item-label">Fig. App.II.2</span> The relationship between ambitions, abilities, opportunities and states of fulfillment. Ability and opportunities have been expressed in arbitrary units. Gradation of ambition is roughly in terms of the author's view of the commonly felt aspirations within the medical profession. Some individuals may have legitimately wide differences of opinion; for instance, a dedicated doctor may correctly feel that devoted work in a rural area should rank higher than getting the Nobel Prize. The dotted line running diagonally indicates that (a) as ability improves, opportunities multiply, and (b) as ambition soars higher, opportunities decline.</div><img alt="Fig. App.II.2" src="/MediumImage/301-1.jpg"><div class="additional-markup"></div></div><p class="indent">If the ambitions are set at a level too high for abilities, the few opportunities that are available are cornered by those with superior ability, making the individual disgruntled. If a person with exceptional abilities chooses a station that does not challenge his abilities sufficiently, he soon gets frustrated. In cases where ambitions and abilities are well-matched at the lower end of the scale, there is often a lurking inferiority complex which disturbs mental peace. If the matching is good at the higher end of the scale, there is a persistent nagging drive for better achievement and recognition. The dotted circle indicates that the most contented and happy are those with average abilities who harbour average ambitions, and have succeeded in finding work commensurate with their ambitions and abilities.</p><p class="indent">AMC, Army Medical Corps; Disp, Dispensary; Hosp, Hospital; Instt, Institute; MC, Medical College; MO, Medical Officer; PHC, Primary Health Centre; PP, Private Practice; Prof, Professor.<a name="page302"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">302</span></span></p><div class="bibliography" id="ch22bib">
