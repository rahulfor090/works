Our current understanding of the scientific method is based on contributions made by two diverse sources. On one hand are the philosophers who go into the minutiae of the science of logic and prescribe the least fallible ways of arriving at the truth. The other set of scholars are the historians of science who examine critically the methods which scientists have used in the past in their work, the methods that have worked the best, and the methods that led to errors. This historical knowledge is then translated into useful wisdom for scientists to use as a guide in their work. The evolution of the scientific method using both these approaches has been going on in the present era for about 400 years. During this period, ideas about the scientific method have been revised several times, and there have also been controversies which have by no means disappeared completely even today. Thus, not only scientific knowledge but also the scientific method is open to revision.</p><p class="indent">Observations are the bedrock of scientific knowledge. While observations are not as infallible as one may think, what adds further sources of error is the fact that the observations may be organized and analyzed in several ways, from several angles. The analyzed data is then subjected to logic, and a permissible dose of disciplined imagination added in order to arrive at a tentative piece of scientific knowledge. While there are statistical safeguards which prevent this <a name="page257"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">257</span></span>composite approach from getting vitiated by error and prejudice, there are some attitudinal traits which are essential for reliable research.</p><div class="section" id="ch18lev1sec1"><h1 class="title">ATTITUDINAL ESSENTIALS</h1>
<p class="noindent">One of the essential features of modern science is that it does not accept anything solely on authority. No matter who has said something, first, it should be based on application of the scientific method, and secondly, it is open to revision if more refined scientific studies indicate that it is not true. This requires a persistent scepticism – doubting what an authority says, doubting what a book says, and doubting what the scientist himself thinks. It also requires a critical attitude – a habit of examining everything with an open mind, always trying to question whether something is amiss, or the same set of facts could have an alternative explanation. It would be unrealistic to say that a scientist should not have any preconceived ideas. What is important is that his attachment to these ideas should not be so strong as to prejudice his observations or their interpretation. He should be able to treat his data in a dispassionate manner irrespective of where they are leading. Finally, he should be able to think clearly and logically. Some creative imagination is also important for formulating good questions, hypotheses and theories, but the scientist should always be clear about the point where facts end and conjecture begins.</p>
</div><div class="section" id="ch18lev1sec2"><h1 class="title">TYPICAL SEQUENCE</h1>
<p class="noindent">The typical sequence which scientific exploration follows has already been discussed (<a href="/9788184484175/chapter/ch3" class="ulink-exter">Chapter 3</a>). Briefly, it starts with a question which may be based on an observation. A provisional answer to the question forms the hypothesis. The hypothesis may be in the form of a prediction based on a cause-effect relationship visualised by the scientist. Alternatively, the hypothesis may follow deductive reasoning (proceeding from general to specific). Then a controlled study is designed to test the hypothesis. The study may be purely observational, or it may be an experimental study. Although the dividing line between the types of studies may be sometimes blurred, in an experimental study the scientist interferes with the conditions of the study in some way so as to make them most appropriate for his purpose. In either type of study, observations form the core of the study. The observations should be accurate, unbiased, and preferably quantitative. The observations are organised, analysed and interpreted. The result <a name="page258"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">258</span></span>is that the hypothesis is either supported or refuted. If the hypothesis is refuted, another study may be performed to test an alternative hypothesis. If the hypothesis is supported, it provides a framework for more studies. If the hypothesis, and predictions based on it, are supported by a large number of studies, all these studies may form the basis of a theory. Development of the theory involves inductive reasoning. Proceeding from specific facts uncovered by individual studies, we arrive at a general truth. So long as subsequent studies go on giving results consistent with the theory, the theory keeps getting strengthened. But if some studies give results which cannot be explained by the theory, depending on the nature and degree of disagreement, the theory may be refined, modified, or rejected completely. This is referred to as the self-correcting tendency of science.</p>
<p class="indent">Besides new studies based on the hypothesis, replication of older studies also has an important place in science. Therefore, in scientific reports, description of methodology should be adequate to enable any other scientist to repeat the experiment. Reproducible results are an important criterion of reliable science.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<h2 class="title">OCCAM'S RAZOR</h2>
<p class="noindent">The 13th century British philosopher William of Occam (also spelt Ockham) enunciated the principle that “entities should not be multiplied unnecessarily.” In science, the expression Occam's razor refers to the principle that if two alternative hypotheses or theories are consistent with observations, the simpler of the two is chosen. This is only a working principle: there is no reason why the simple one should be correct and the complicated one wrong. In science, research based on the theory chosen continues. If observations continue to be consistent with the chosen theory, it is considered valid. If some inconsistent observations compel us to add some complications to the theory, science is quite open to them.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch18lev2sec1"><h2 class="title">Scientific Revolutions</h2>
<p class="noindent">Thomas Kuhn made an important contribution to the history and philosophy of science through his classic <span class="italic">The Structure of Scientific Revolutions.</span> Kuhn points out that most scientists spend all their life practising ‘normal science’. Normal science selects problems for exploration, and interprets observations, within the framework of a set of beliefs (called paradigms) which are shared by all scientists working in that area. Problems which do not fit into the prevailing paradigm are generally avoided by scientists because they are generally considered outside the purview of science.<a name="page259"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">259</span></span></p>
<div class="sidebar">
<h2 class="title">CAUSE, EFFECT, OR NEITHER</h2>
<p class="">A lot of interesting research investigates the cause-effect relationship between variables. A mere significant association does not prove a cause-effect relationship: the relationship may be causal or casual. If variables A and B are significantly correlated, A may be the cause and B the effect; B may be the cause and A the effect; or A and B may be both influenced by a third variable – the third variable is called a confounding variable. For example, malaria (literally, bad air) is significantly correlated with poor environmental hygiene. But poor environmental hygiene is not directly the cause of malaria.</p>
<p class="indent">The basic principles suggesting a cause and effect relationship are that first, the cause precedes the effect in time; and second, the absence of the cause always prevents the effect. However, things are not always so simple. For example, cancer causes weight loss; but absence of cancer does not always prevent weight loss because weight loss may result from poor eating, malabsorption or hyperthyroidism. Experiments are designed for testing cause-effect relationships based on the method of agreement or the method of difference.</p>
<p class=""><bold>1. Method of Agreement</bold></p>
<p class="">If all the circumstances which lead to an effect have one factor in common, the common factor is likely to be the cause. This method is highly flawed. The classic example to illustrate its fallacy is that soda + whiskey, soda + brandy, and soda + vodka may all make a person drunk. The common factor is soda, but soda is not the cause of drunkenness.</p>
<p class=""><bold>2. Method of Difference</bold></p>
<p class="">If two sets of circumstances are identical except with respect to one variable, and the effect is seen only when that one variable is present, that variable is the cause. This is how a control group may differ from an experimental group. The flaw in this method is that it is almost impossible in medicine to have two identical groups: there are always several uncontrolled and uncontrollable differences (known and unknown) between the two groups in addition to the difference built into the experimental design.</p>
<p class=""><bold>3. Combination of the method of agreement and the method of difference</bold></p>
<p class="">The combination of the two methods tends to be less faulty than either method alone.</p>
</div>
<p class="noindent">And, the interpretation of data collected on problems that are selected has an element of arbitrariness that arises from the beliefs shared by the profession. The shared beliefs are absorbed without conscious effort in the course of learning about science, specially the area of specialization. Thus ‘normal science’ resembles puzzle-solving activity. Only pieces which seem to belong to the puzzle are of interest to the one trying to solve the puzzle; the pieces have to be arranged within the framework of some rules (e.g. the plane surface should be down, all the space in the puzzle should be filled up, all the pieces should be used up, no piece should jut out, etc.); and last but not least, the person is confident of solving the puzzle within the framework of the rules.</p>
<p class="indent">But every once in a while, there are anomalous observations which just do not fit into the accepted paradigm. In the beginning, there is great resistance to changing the paradigm, but if such anomalies multiply, there is a re-thinking about the paradigm itself. At this stage, <a name="page260"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">260</span></span>the outstanding problems which had defied exploration within the old paradigm are also resurrected. Gradually, the prevailing paradigm is either rejected, or assimilated into a new broader paradigm. A paradigm shift in science is what Thomas Kuhn calls a scientific revolution. From the areas that I am familiar with, I can visualize at least three major paradigm shifts in our beliefs about the etiology of disease.</p>
<p class="indent">When Eijkman discovered in 1897 that a polished rice diet was the cause of beriberi, and that the condition could be cured by feeding unpolished rice, he interpreted it as follows: rice husk contains an antidote to a nerve poison produced in the intestine by a starchy diet. The reason was that in 1897 the prevailing paradigm about the etiology of disease was that the disease was caused by the presence of an agent, such as bacteria, in the body. As more and more similar discoveries were made, a new paradigm emerged: disease could also be due to the <span class="italic">absence</span> of an agent. This did not invalidate the former paradigm: the two co-existed, or one might say that the two were synthesized into the broader paradigm that disease may be caused by the presence (e.g. bacteria or toxins) <span class="italic">or absence</span> (e.g. vitamins or hormones) of an agent.</p>
<p class="indent">The paradigm that disease could be caused by the presence or absence of the agent also received a jolt when it was observed that the decline in the prevalence of tuberculosis in Western Europe and North America preceded the use of anti-tubercular drugs by at least 20 years: the decline in prevalence coincided with improvements in nutritional status and sanitation. Observations such as this one multiplied, and finally the paradigm expanded to include not only the agent but also the host and envionrment in the etiology of disease.</p>
<p class="indent">In the 1950s, cardiovascular diseases (coronary artery disease, hypertension and stroke) emerged as the major killers in the developed countries. The etiology of these diseases was even more complex, and therefore could not be explained fully in terms of the prevailing paradigm, which may be called the biosocial model of disease. The initial research (roughly, 1950-1970), on the role of psychological factors in the etiology of cardiovascular disease (CVD) was dismissed as ‘unscientific’. Then came research which led to the emergence of psychoneuroimmunology (1970-1990), which placed the mind-body relationship on a scientific footing. This gave scientific sanction for the use of mind-body approaches (e.g. biofeedback, relaxation techniques, yoga, etc.) for treatment. As evidence accumulated about the efficacy of these treatment modalities, our accepted beliefs about <a name="page261"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">261</span></span>etiology expanded further: the new paradigm has been called the biopsychosocial model of disease.</p>
<p class="indent">There is no conflict between ‘normal science’ and scientific revolutions; in fact, there would be no revolutions without ‘normal science’. Science does not seek novelties – it has an in-built mechanism for discovering them from time to time. The game of science is played under one set of rules; in the course of playing the game, new facts are discovered which call for refinement, replacement or relaxation of the rules. That is how a new set of rules is generated. As Kuhn puts it, tradition-shattering complements the tradition-bound activity of normal science. In short, scientific revolutions are a part of the self-correcting nature of science on a larger scale.</p>
<p class="indent">The initial resistance of ‘normal science’ to a revolution also serves a purpose. It protects science from getting distracted by sub-standard or unscrupulous research. A new paradigm becomes acceptable only when a critical mass of research shows clearly the inadequacies of the old paradigm in explaining a series of observations or in solving problems. Further, the new paradigm should be consistent with not only the new findings, but also with established knowledge. Finally, paradigm shift is not a conscious process or a clearly defined event. It is a gradual process which can be understood only in retrospect.</p>
</div>
</div><div class="section" id="ch18lev1sec3"><h1 class="title">ATYPICAL METHODS</h1>
<p class="noindent">While there is a systematic sequence in which scientific research typically proceeds, it is not essential that it should always be so. In fact, real science often deviates from the standard method. The most romantic deviation is the intuitive flash of insight that leads the scientist to a discovery by a short-cut. Typical examples are the ‘Eureka experience’ of Archimedes leading to the concept of specific gravity, and the ‘snake-dream’ of Kekule leading to the discovery of the structure of the benzene ring. It is true that deviations from the formal process of scientific activity get eliminated in today's research papers because the present norms of an ideal report require a concise, impersonal and dispassionate description of research. The deviations may be discovered only in lab notebooks, or in interviews with the investigators. On the other hand, there are also a few sobering facts about accidental discoveries and intuitive flashes which are worth mentioning.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="italic">First,</span> the contributions of atypical routes to scientific progress are generally exaggerated. Much of scientific progress is the result of essentially systematic research. <span class="italic">Secondly,</span> the descriptions of accidental <a name="page262"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">262</span></span>discoveries and intuitive flashes are often compressed, simplified, and even distorted to make them look romantic. There is a universal yearning for the spectacular. As a result, some spice gets added to the story every time it is retold. For example, it is often said that Newton suddenly discovered gravity by questioning why apples fall down instead of flying up after an apple fell on his head. It is doubtful if it was as dramatic as that. What Newton himself has said is something to the effect that he had often wondered <span class="italic">for a long time</span> how an apple, when it got detached from the tree, moved towards the earth. Even in this description, Newton might have used ‘falling apples’ as an example of ‘falling objects’ in general in order to drive home a point effectively. Similarly, the long period of intense engagement with a difficult problem which Archimedes and Kekule had experienced before their dramatic discoveries is well known. It is this intense and prolonged engagement which prepares the background for the intuitive flashes which emerge from ill-understood depths of the mind. Accidental discoveries are also not as accidental as they seem. Many bacterial cultures might have been spoilt by fungi before Fleming converted the accident into the discovery of penicillin. To quote Louis Pasteur, himself credited with several accidental discoveries, “Chance favours the prepared mind”. <span class="italic">Finally,</span> one cannot engineer at will an intuitive flash or a fruitful accident. If a person has decided to become a scientist before experiencing any such dramatic event, he has to start with normal systematic research. With passionate long-term involvement in his work <span class="italic">and</span> good luck, one day he might also benefit from some supra-normal events.</p>
</div><div class="section" id="ch18lev1sec4"><h1 class="title">CLOSING THOUGHTS</h1>
<p class="noindent">In general, scientists have a healthy distaste for the scientific method. They prefer to pick up its most essential elements while actually doing the research. The method itself has also evolved to become more flexible during the twentieth century. Till the beginning of the twentieth century, the crux of the scientific method was a combination of empiricism and logical positivism, or to put it simply, observation and logic. Experimental observations were used for answering a question in terms of the probability with which the answer was true. The process involved inductive reasoning, that is, generalizing from a limited number of observations. Karl Popper objected to this method on the ground that it is not proper to make a universal statement on the basis of a limited number of observations even on a probabilistic basis. To overcome this problem, he proposed a deductive model in which the emphasis is on falsification. A hypothesis is proposed, which <a name="page263"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">263</span></span>is unlikely to be true, i.e. just the opposite of what the scientist intuitively expects the study to show. The hypothesis is a general statement. Then the study is conducted, which gives specific observations. The observations are analysed, and if the hypothesis fails the test, it is falsified. However, if it passes the test, it is considered provisionally true. Since the reasoning proceeds from the general statement (hypothesis) to specific observations, the reasoning is deductive. By his emphasis on deductive reasoning, Karl Popper succeeded in checking inductive speculation in science. But now the trend once again is to propose a hypothesis which is likely to be true rather than false. However, in some cases falsification seems more natural. For example, David Spiegel, a psychiatrist, could easily accept that psychosocial interventions in cancer might help the patient feel better, but he was highly sceptical about claims that these interventions affect the biology of the cancer favourably, and thereby actually prolong life. To test such claims, he set up a randomized controlled trial on stage 4 metastatic breast cancer. Contrary to his expectation, the patients who received his psychosocial intervention survived, on an average, twice as long as the control patients, and all the patients alive at the 5-year follow up belonged to the experimental group (Spiegel 1989). Thus his hypothesis was falsified by the study. The rigidity of the scientific method has been further relaxed by Thomas Kuhn and his colleague Paul Feyerabend. According to Kuhn, along with observations and logic, the broad notions that scientists pick up in the course of their education also influence the interpretation of experiments. Thus the scientific community is itself one of the ingredients that shape the content of science. Feyrabend has gone further in defending creative freedom of the scientist in relation to the stifling influence of a rigid, although rational, method. In short, experimentation with the scientific method itself during the twentieth century has made the method receptive to various approaches. The result is that today every branch of science has its own way of designing experiments, and analyzing and interpreting data, which is most suited to the type of problems it investigates. What is left of the universal scientific method is just the two broad principles with which we started at the beginning of the twentieth century, i.e. observations are supreme, and rationality is to be respected.<a name="page264"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">264</span></span></p>
