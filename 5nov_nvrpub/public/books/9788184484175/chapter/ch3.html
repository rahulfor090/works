In this chapter, we shall briefly outline the steps. Some steps which merit a more detailed treatment will be discussed again in the subsequent chapters.</p><div class="section" id="ch3lev1sec1"><h1 class="title">IDEA</h1>
<p class="noindent">Every piece of research is born as an idea. The idea may occur as an intuitive flash, or may emanate logically from a previous study. The intuitive flash may occur in bed or in the bathroom, or while reading a book. The idea on which a research study is based is of capital importance because the impact of the study depends on the quality of the idea behind it. Since research is time-consuming, and the time required for working on a poor idea is just as much as that required for working on a good idea, it is extremely important to select the idea with great care. The tragedy of life is that the best of ideas do not occur when needed the most. The way to solve this problem is to store ideas for opportune moments. All good research workers collect ideas the way children collect stamps or coins. Whether you are actually engaged in research, or intend getting into it later in life, it is a good idea to keep a paper and pen handy all the time, and jot down the idea as soon as it occurs. It is futile to depend on memory: in spite of the best intentions most ideas are lost unless recorded immediately. Just as important as recording ideas is building up a system for storing them. Otherwise, instead of the ideas getting lost, the scraps of paper on which they have been noted will get lost! The old fashioned way of storing ideas is to use either index cards or a file; now there are <a name="page14"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">14</span></span>electronic options available. But seeing the frequency with which accidents wipe out stuff stored electronically, I would still prefer the old fashioned storage systems. At the first available opportunity, transfer the idea from the scrap of paper to an index card or an A4 sheet (only one idea per card or sheet). Elaborate upon the idea a bit as you copy it, and add the card or sheet to your collection. You may also add the date to the idea: it may give you some nostalgic pleasure when you flip through several virgin ideas a quarter of a century later.</p>
<p class="indent">Let us assume that the great day has finally arrived when you have the opportunity for research, and you have to take out your collection of ideas to select one gem. As you go through your collection, you may find that many of your own ideas do not appeal to you any more for one reason or the other. Among the ideas which deserve a second look, some may be fascinating but impractical; some others may be feasible but you may not have the facilities to pursue them. Finally, you may be left with very few ideas worth considering in your present circumstances. To narrow down your choice further, search the literature for work already available on the idea. This search has been made very easy by the internet. You should consider yourself lucky if nobody has done something <span class="italic">similar</span> to what you have in mind. At the same time, it is quite likely that nobody has done <span class="italic">exactly</span> what you have in mind. After considering how significant your study would be in view of the work already available, select one or two most promising ideas. Now discuss these ideas with a few friendly colleagues over a cup of tea. This process would further help you make a good choice, and will also sharpen the focus of your ideas. Now that you have selected your idea, it will have to be followed up with a lot of work. Without that work, the idea will just remain an idea; it will never get translated into a real study. Do not wait endlessly for that dream idea which is sure to change the world. While selecting a good idea is important, waiting indefinitely for the best idea to arrive is unwise: one can spend the whole life rejecting one idea after another in the hope of getting the perfect idea one fine day.</p>
<p class="indent">It is indeed important to give a good thought to the selection of the idea before going any further because time and other resources are limited. Doing a couple of studies emanating from an idea is easily a five-year job, and an individual does not have too many five-year blocks in his working life. At the beginning of one's career, the student invariably works on the ideas of his research guide; towards the end of one's career, a scientist's most important task is to encourage his <a name="page15"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">15</span></span>younger colleagues to pursue their own ideas. That leaves only about ten years to work on one's own ideas. If during those years the scientist builds up facilities for a particular type of work and a reputation which attracts research grants, younger colleagues may find it tempting to continue working in the same area. That is how schools of research are built up.</p>
<p class="indent">A few words specially for the young person entering research as part of a degree programme. That is the stage when one may have (or at least should have) many dreams about subjects for research and also the confidence to achieve breakthroughs. Paradoxically, this is also the stage when the student cannot afford any romantic fantasies. The student is dependent on the guide for advice as well as resources, and has to accomplish a publishable piece of work within a limited time frame. These constraints make it necessary for the student to work on an extension of the work already going on in the guide's laboratory. Accepting this reality avoids friction and frustration, and allows completion of the work within the stipulated time. This arrangement should not be viewed as a waste of time because the principal gain from the first few research projects is first-hand knowledge of the process of research. The knowledge so gained can be applied to any project on any subject undertaken in future. While all this is important for the student, an understanding guide should also keep in mind that this is an arrangement which represents a compromise between the academic freedom of the candidate and the ground realities. Therefore, the propensity of the student regarding the subject of research should be accommodated as far as possible. Further, the guide should create an atmosphere which inspires the student to develop a liking for the subject he has been asked to work on. What achieves this best is the passionate involvement of the guide himself in the subject of research.</p>
</div><div class="section" id="ch3lev1sec2"><h1 class="title">THE PROBLEM</h1>
<p class="noindent">Once the idea has been selected, the next step is to identify the problem. Searching the literature must have already revealed to the student the areas of ignorance, commonly called the lacunae. Based on the lacunae, the problem may belong to one out of three broad categories (<a href="#ch3fig1" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 3.1</a>). <span class="italic">First,</span> it may be an area of total ignorance. Nobody ever did anything on the subject ever before. Here is an opportunity to be a pioneer, but such problems are extremely rare today. <span class="italic">Second,</span> it may be an area of controversy. There may be several studies available on the subject, but their results are conflicting. Now you can <a name="page16"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">16</span></span>dream of designing that decisive study which will resolve the issue once and for all. However, do not be disappointed if your study succeeds in only adding to the controversy. <span class="italic">Third,</span> the literature search might reveal an ocean of knowledge. However, you may find that for each question that has been answered by the studies available, several new questions have been raised. In short, in spite of all that is known, there is scope for more studies which would extend the limits of knowledge. Most of the problems tackled by research today fall in this category.</p>
<div class="figure" id="ch3fig1" data-label="Fig. 3.1"><div class="title"><span class="item-label">Fig. 3.1</span> The three broad categories of research problems:(1) total ignorance, (2) controversy, and (3) extension of existing knowledge</div><img alt="Fig. 3.1" src="/MediumImage/16-1.jpg"><div class="additional-markup"></div></div>
</div><div class="section" id="ch3lev1sec3"><h1 class="title">THE QUESTION</h1>
<p class="noindent">Once the problem has been identified, the next step is to formulate one or more clear questions which the research will seek to answer. Let us assume the problem belongs to the third category, i.e. there is scope for extending existing studies. Although a variety of extensions in different directions may be desirable, we have to choose the direction which is relevant, exciting, and feasible in terms of available expertise and facilities. Depending on the direction selected, a few clear questions should now be formulated. For example, suppose our original idea was to study the relationship between diet and coronary heart disease (CHD). We survey the literature and find thousands of studies on the subject, and also discover that the relationship between dietary fat and CHD is a fertile area of research in which controversies <a name="page17"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">17</span></span>persist and further work is warranted. Further, we discover that the blanket ban on desi ghee being imposed by doctors is not based on studies specifically on ghee but on other saturated fats. We start wondering whether the blanket ban is justified in view of the fact that ghee has been consumed by Indians for centuries whereas the high incidence of CHD is a recent phenomenon. Therefore we decide to study the relationship between ghee and CHD. Now, several questions suggest themselves, and we have to select one of them (<a href="#ch3tbl1" class="ulink-inter">Table 3.1</a>). The Table illustrates the kinds of considerations which guide us towards the selection of the final question. The final question forms the basis of the ‘objectives’ of the project. Continuing with the same example, the objectives of the study are:</p>
<p class="indent">In a corn-oil based diet, to study the effect of replacing one third of the corn oil with ghee on:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p class="">Serum total cholesterol and its fractions</p></li>
<li><p class="">Serum triglycerides</p></li>
<li><p class="">Platelet aggregation</p></li>
</ol>
</div><div class="section" id="ch3lev1sec4"><h1 class="title">EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN</h1>
<p class="noindent">Experimental design is the first step in translating a question into an actual study. It includes a consideration of the subjects that will be used (humans or animals, healthy or diseased), the groups into which they will be divided, the treatment<sup><a href="#ch3fn1" class="ulink-inter">1</a></sup> each group will receive and for how long, and the variables that will be studied. The principal outcome measures are identified, and how much effect on the outcome measures would be considered significant is also decided. Based on these considerations, the minimum number of subjects is also determined.<sup><a href="#ch3fn2" class="ulink-inter">2</a></sup></p>
<div class="section" id="ch3lev2sec1"><h2 class="title">Controls</h2>
<p class="noindent">Simply the fact that an experimental treatment leads to an effect does not necessarily mean that the effect is due to the treatment.</p>

<p class="noindent">One precaution which minimizes errors of interpretation is the use of controls. Depending on the nature of the study, there can be many types of control. We shall go into details in <a href="/9788184484175/chapter/ch4" class="ulink-exter">Chapter 4</a>, but here the concept will be illustrated through a few examples.</p>
<p class="indent">Suppose we wish to study the efficacy of a new drug for a certain disease. If the drug seems to help, it may be the genuine effect of the drug, or it may be because the disease is self-limiting. In order to resolve this issue, we take two groups of patients. One group gets the drug, the other does not. The untreated group is called the control <a name="page19"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">19</span></span>group. If the group on the drug recovers faster than the untreated group, we may conclude that the drug is genuinely helpful.</p>
<p class="indent">However, it is possible that the drug-treated group recovers faster because the patients believe that the drug would help. In order to resolve whether the effect of the drug is chemical or ‘psychological’, we give to the control group a pill or capsule which looks like the preparation being given to the treated group. But the pill or capsule being given to the control group does not contain the drug; instead, it contains an ‘inert’ substance such as sugar (called the placebo). Now our trial would be called a placebo-controlled trial. Obviously, the patients should not know whether they are getting the drug or the placebo. But if the investigators interacting with the patients know which patient is getting what, the investigators’ behaviour might influence the results (e.g. cheering up the patients on the drug, and sympathizing with the patients on the placebo). Therefore the pills should be coded, and the investigators interacting with the patients should not know the code. The code should be broken only at the end of the study. Now we have the design for a double-blind placebo-controlled trial, so called because both the patients and the investigators are blind to the treatment being given to a particular patient.</p>
<p class="indent">But the study is still not foolproof. The patients in the two groups may not be similar. If the patients in the drug-treated group are milder cases of the disease, they would in any case recover faster. In order to make the two groups well-matched, a popular technique is to randomize the allocation of patients to the two groups. If this is done, we have the design for a randomized double-blind placebo controlled trial. The importance of having well-matched groups may be understood from an extreme hypothetical example. Suppose a study has been designed to assess the efficacy of a drug for prevention of sea sickness. Even the most worthless treatment would seem wonderful if those who receive the drug happen to be all seamen, and those who get the placebo are passengers!</p>
<p class="indent">However, in spite of all precautions, our observations may still get affected by unforeseen accidental factors, leading to incorrect conclusions. That is why observations have to be subjected to a statistical analysis.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch3lev2sec2"><h2 class="title">Statistics</h2>
<p class="noindent">The role of a statistician begins when a research problem is conceived, and continues till the work has been published. Statisticians are experts in advising on the best experimental design, the minimum number of <a name="page20"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">20</span></span>subjects required, and the most appropriate tests for the analysis of the data. Therefore the right time to consult a statistician is when the study is being designed. The experimental design is so crucial to the success of the study that the time and effort spent on it is always worthwhile. Well begun is truly more than half done.</p>
<p class="indent">(For details, <span class="italic">see</span> <a href="/9788184484175/chapter/ch4" class="ulink-exter">Chapter 4</a>).</p>
</div>
</div><div class="section" id="ch3lev1sec5"><h1 class="title">METHODS</h1>
<p class="noindent">After the experimental design is ready, one has to get serious about the techniques to be used for the various measurements involved. Some of these might be already established in the lab, or in a friend's lab. The rest have to be either established, or one has to find a reliable place from where one can get the measurement done on payment. Establishing new techniques has become easier now because of the ready availability of user-friendly kits and computerized equipment. But still there are enough imponderables left for quality control to be an essential requirement (see <a href="/9788184484175/chapter/ch9" class="ulink-exter">Chapter 9</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">Once most of the techniques to be used are in place, it is always a good idea to perform a few pilot experiments. The experience gained from these experiments is very useful in improving the study before it is too late.</p>
</div><div class="section" id="ch3lev1sec6"><h1 class="title">APPLYING FOR A RESEARCH GRANT</h1>
<p class="noindent">If the project is such that it needs only pen, paper and at the most a computer, and the scientist can do it all by himself, a research grant may not be necessary. But if a grant is necessary, an application has to be made to a funding agency. The steps outlined earlier are nearly enough to prepare the skeleton of the application. However, some padding is needed, and the information has to be adapted to formal headings. In addition, the agency also has to be told what the investigators want and how much it will cost, and how important the project is (<a href="#ch3tbl2" class="ulink-inter">Table 3.2</a>).</p>
<p class="indent">(For details, <span class="italic">see</span> <a href="/9788184484175/chapter/ch12" class="ulink-exter">Chapter 12</a>).<a name="page21"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">21</span></span></p>

</div><div class="section" id="ch3lev1sec7"><h1 class="title">THE STUDY</h1>
<p class="noindent">Assuming that the grant has been sanctioned, or is not necessary, we begin the study. Utmost attention should be paid to the conditions of the experiment because the observations depend on that. Next, the maximum possible care should be taken to record the observations correctly. Besides what was planned, any unplanned and unexpected observations should also be recorded. The recording should be immediate, and in a notebook or register. Leaving things to memory is unreliable, and noting down observations on scraps of paper is unsafe. Considering the effort it takes to reach this stage, it would be a pity to lose observations through avoidable negligence.</p>
</div><div class="section" id="ch3lev1sec8"><h1 class="title">ANALYSIS AND INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS</h1>
<p class="noindent">Raw data is often too voluminous and does not make much sense. The first step is to organize it into appropriate tables, charts and graphs. Multiple observations are condensed by calculation of measures of central tendency (e.g. mean) and dispersion (e.g. standard deviation). Condensation of data is always a compromise. It needs a fine judgment to decide how much detail may be sacrificed in the interest of clarity and convenience while still leaving the essentials intact. Looking at the raw data again and again may require repeated analysis from different angles. This is an effort which is enjoyable as well as immensely rewarding.</p>
<p class="indent">A tentative interpretation of the data is generally possible after the analysis. But truly objective interpretation would require the <a name="page22"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">22</span></span>application of appropriate statistical tests. For example, whether the difference observed in an outcome measure following two different treatments is a genuine difference is assessed statistically in terms of probability. The calculated probability is expressed in terms of ‘P’ value. Thus P&lt;0.05 means that the probability of the observed difference being due to chance factors is less than 5%. In other words, the probability of the difference being genuine is greater than 95%. When P&lt;0.05, the result is generally considered statistically significant. In other words, science does not prove or disprove anything with absolute certainty. Scientific evidence is in terms of probability. If the probability of something being true is greater than 95% it is tentatively accepted as a scientifically proven truth. It is because of the doubt up to the tune of 5% that we keep our mind open to a revision if observations made anytime in the future indicate that a revision is necessary. Being always open to revision is both a weakness and a strength of science. It is a weakness because scientific knowledge is always tentative; it is a strength because it enables scientific knowledge to improve and grow constantly without being obstructed by tradition or authority.</p>
<p class="indent">There are numerous examples of major revisions in medical knowledge. In the 1950s, vasopressin and oxytocin were thought to be synthesized in the posterior pituitary; today we know they are synthesized in the hypothalamus. In the 1960s, patients having peptic ulcer were advised a low residue diet; by the 1980s, the advice was withdrawn. Till the 1980s, all the known effects of polyunsaturated fats (PUFA) were favourable, and therefore these fats were advised as the exclusive visible fat; by the 1990s we also learnt about some of their adverse effects. Therefore today it is recommended that PUFA should provide only about one-third of the fat energy in the diet. Till recently there was a blanket ban on sugar for diabetics. Today they are allowed up to 10% of the energy intake as sucrose, provided the glycaemic index of meals is kept low by other constituents of the diet. That is why when a professor of medicine was retiring, he made two confessions to his students: first, that only half of what he had taught them was true; and second, that he did not know which that half was.

</div><div class="section" id="ch3lev1sec9"><h1 class="title">WRITING UP THE WORK</h1>
<p class="noindent">Talent for doing good research and the flair for writing do not necessarily go together. Therefore it is helpful to have in the research group at least one person who will relish writing up the research in <a name="page23"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">23</span></span>readable prose. Writing up the research is a necessity as well as a responsibility. It is a necessity for getting jobs, promotions, and further research grants. It is also a responsibility because the benefits of research, which is largely funded by the tax-payer, should reach the society. The benefits cannot reach the society unless the findings of the research become authentic public knowledge, which happens best through scientific publications. Therefore the tyranny of sloth or impulses of self-denial should not be allowed to justify sleeping over publishable research data.
