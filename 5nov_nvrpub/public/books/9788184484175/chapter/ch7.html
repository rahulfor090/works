First, it goes beyond the individual since it addresses the concerns of the society, of which the individual is a part. Secondly, it emphasises prevention–primary, if possible; if not, at the earliest level possible. Accordingly, there are certain types of studies which fall more directly within the ambit of public health, and the special characteristics of some of these studies will be discussed in this chapter.</p><div class="section" id="ch7lev1sec1"><h1 class="title">MEASUREMENT OF FREQUENCY</h1>
<p class="noindent">Studies which measure the frequency of a disease are observational studies in which the investigator, interfering as little as possible, merely tries to find out how often the disease occurs in the population under study. The aim of such studies goes beyond data collection. These studies reveal the magnitude of the problem and thereby give an objective yardstick to policymakers for determining how much attention and outlay is justified for the prevention and treatment of the disease. Further, by measuring the frequency of the disease in subgroups of the population that have or have not been exposed to certain suspected risk factors, these studies can determine the strength of the association between the risk factors and the disease and thereby suggest preventive strategies. Finally, the same techniques of measuring frequency can be used for assessing how often the disease leads to certain specified outcomes. For example, how many patients who have had diabetes for 20 years have retinopathy? Such studies suggest the strategies for prevention of complications. Further, measuring the frequency of specified outcomes of the disease in treated and untreated groups of patients tells us how beneficial the treatment is.<a name="page88"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">88</span></span></p>
<p class="indent">The two standard measures of frequency are prevalence and incidence. <span class="italic">Prevalence</span> is the proportion of a population having a disease at a given point of time. Prevalence is expressed as a fraction, e.g. 50 cases per population of 1000. Thus prevalence is a count of all the people who have the disease at the time of the study. On the other hand, <span class="italic">incidence</span> is a count of the new cases of the disease that develop in the population over a given period of time. Incidence is measured as the proportion of a population, initially not having the disease, that develops the disease over the period of observation. Incidence is expressed as a rate, e.g. 25 cases/population of 1000/year.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch7lev2sec1"><h2 class="title">Prevalence Studies</h2>
<p class="noindent">Prevalence studies estimate the total number of cases of a disease in a population. Generally it is not the entire population that is surveyed, but only a sample. Care should be taken that the sample is truly representative.</p>
<p class="indent">The results of the study depend markedly on what method is employed for identifying cases: are people simply asked whether they have the disease, or does the investigator ask a few probing questions regarding manifestations of the disease before coming to a conclusion, or are some laboratory tests also done before labelling a person as a case. For diseases such as diabetes, the prevalence is much higher if lab tests are the criteria for identification. But for diseases such as ‘acidity’ or ‘migraine’ the prevalence is higher if the identification is based simply on asking the patient whether he has the disease.</p>
<p class="indent">Prevalence is considered to be the total number of cases ‘prevailing’ at a <span class="italic">point in time</span> although it might take several months to collect the data. Prevalence studies are also called cross-sectional studies. Although prevalence studies have several flaws and limitations, they are conducted quite commonly because they are much more convenient than incidence studies. In spite of their drawbacks, prevalence studies are useful for a rough assessment of the magnitude of a problem and for comparing the magnitude of problems such as iodine deficiency, anemia or AIDS in different geographical areas. Physicians also use, at a subconscious level, prevalence studies for diagnosing individual patients in their practice. If a disease is highly prevalent in a geographical area, it creates a bias in the physician's mind which generally works in favour of a correct diagnosis. For example, in a patient having pleural effusion, whether a physician considers the possibility of tuberculosis higher than malignancy, or the other way round, depends on the prevalence of tuberculosis in the geographical area where the patient is seen.<a name="page89"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">89</span></span></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch7lev2sec2"><h2 class="title">Incidence Studies</h2>
<p class="noindent">Incidence studies start with a representative sample of the population which is free of the disease under study. This sample is called a cohort. The cohort is followed up, and every new case of the disease is recorded. For reasons which are easy to visualize, incidence studies are also called cohort studies, longitudinal studies or prospective studies. Incidence is a more reliable indicator of the magnitude of the problem arising from a disease than prevalence. Since incidence studies can go on for a long time, they also give the trend of change. For example, if the incidence of a disease rises year after year, it can serve as a warning for urgent action and also suggest factors which might enhance risk for the disease. On the other hand, the efficacy of the action can be measured in terms of the degree of fall in incidence. Further, if the incidence shows a falling trend without any active intervention, it can provide valuable leads regarding the environmental or nutritional factors which might have been responsible for the favourable change: these factors can then be investigated in appropriately designed studies.</p>
</div>
</div><div class="section" id="ch7lev1sec2"><h1 class="title">MEASUREMENT OF RISK</h1>
<p class="noindent">Prevalence and incidence studies, particularly the latter, give valuable leads regarding factors which might enhance the risk for a particular disease. The ideal way to confirm the role of a risk factor is to have two comparable groups free of the disease, expose only one of the groups to the risk factor, and then follow up both groups for incidence of the disease. Such experiments, for obvious ethical reasons, can, if at all, be done only on animals. The best human substitute for such experiments is observational cohort studies.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch7lev2sec3"><h2 class="title">Cohort Studies</h2>
<p class="noindent">In the simplest situation, we start with a sample which is free of the disease under study. The sample is classified into two groups depending on whether or not they are exposed to the suspected risk factor. Both groups are followed up for incidence of the disease, and the incidences in the two groups are compared (<a href="#ch7fig1" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 7.1</a>). In real life situations, several risk factors may be studied simultaneously, and therefore, the number of groups may be much larger.</p>
<p class="indent">A few important considerations in cohort studies are:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p class="">the number of persons in each group should be sufficiently large,</p></li>
<li><p class="">the follow-up should be for a long enough period,</p></li>
<li><p class="">all the persons should be followed up throughout the period of study, and<a name="page90"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">90</span></span></p>
<p class=""><div class="figure" id="ch7fig1" data-label="Fig. 7.1"><div class="title"><span class="item-label">Fig. 7.1</span> Design of a cohort study for measuring the impact of a suspected risk factor on the incidence of a disease</div><img alt="Fig. 7.1" src="/MediumImage/90-1.jpg"><div class="additional-markup"></div></div></p></li>
<li><p class="">the subjects should not change their habits or environment in such a way that they start in one group and end up in another.</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="indent">These are not easy conditions to meet. That is why cohort studies are difficult, expensive, uncommon, and when conducted, less than perfect. However, several extremely valuable cohort studies are available in the literature. For example, some convincing evidence for the role of psychological factors in midlife diseases came from a few cohort studies conducted on college students who were classified in terms of psychological characteristics such as the love and intimacy they had enjoyed with their parents. When followed up about thirty years later, there were striking differences in the prevalence of midlife diseases such as hypertension, coronary artery disease, diabetes and cancer which correlated with the psychological characteristics (Thomas and Duszynski 1974; Russek and Schwartz 1997).</p>
<div class="section" id="ch7lev3sec1"><h3 class="title">Interpreting Cohort Studies</h3>
<p class="noindent">The results of cohort studies are expressed in terms of one of the following indices which basically compare the risk of getting the disease in the exposed and non-exposed groups.</p>

But their relative contribution to the prevalence of cirrhosis in a population would depend on how contaminated the drinking water supply is compared to how many people consume alcohol regularly. This fact is taken care of in the population attributable fraction (PAF), which gives the fraction of the disease attributable to a given factor in the population.</p>

<div class="section" id="ch7lev2sec4"><h2 class="title">Case-control Studies</h2>
<p class="noindent">Case-control studies are a relatively convenient substitute for cohort studies, which are very difficult to conduct. The design of case-control studies is, in a way, opposite that of cohort studies. In cohort studies, we start with two groups: exposed and non-exposed, and over time find out how many in each group get the disease. In case-control studies, we start with two groups: diseased and disease-free, and look back in time to find out how many in each group were exposed to the risk factor under study. Since case-control studies involve looking back, they are also called retrospective (<a href="#ch7fig2" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 7.2</a>.). Cohort studies and case-control studies have been compared in <a href="#ch7tbl1" class="ulink-inter">Table 7.1</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">In case-control studies, cases as well as controls are selected by the investigators, and need careful attention for the study to be valid. Although cases are frequently picked up from hospitals, population-based cases are better because they are more representative of the disease as it occurs in the community. New cases are better than all existing cases because existing cases are a product of two factors: incidence of the disease and its duration.<a name="page92"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">92</span></span></p>

<div class="figure" id="ch7fig2" data-label="Fig. 7.2"><div class="title"><span class="item-label">Fig. 7.2</span> Design of a case-control study for measuring the impact of a suspected risk factor on the incidence of a disease. If the suspicion is valid, a retrospective look will probably reveal that those exposed to the risk factor were more numerous in the group having the disease</div><img alt="Fig. 7.2" src="/MediumImage/92-1.jpg"><div class="additional-markup"></div></div>
<p class="noindent">If the factor being studied causes a particularly lethal form of disease, using all existing cases may lead to underestimating the risk posed by the factor. Selecting controls that are comparable to the cases is also not easy. The usual tendency is to match cases and controls for age, sex and area of residence. But that may not be enough, and many factors of importance such as diet, smoking, drinking, physical activity, etc. might make the groups dissimilar. The controls may be selected from the same hospital where the cases are selected, or from outside the hospital. In case of doubts about comparability, more than one control group may be constructed from different sources. If computation of risk based on <a name="page93"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">93</span></span>the two or more control groups gives the same estimate, it points towards absence of bias in the control groups. On the other hand, if the estimates are different, it calls for an investigation of the source of the bias, which means at least one more study! In any case, no matter how many control groups are constructed, the inclusion and exclusion criteria for cases should be the same as for controls. When only one control group is constructed, it is customary to have one control for each case. However, having more controls improves the precision of the study. But having more than 4 controls for each case does not add much to the precision.</p>
<p class="indent">Besides the dissimilarity between the cases and controls, one more source of bias in case-control studies is that the exposure to the risk factor is recorded after the disease has occurred. This fact might affect, first, the recollection of exposure. A person who has cancer might recollect all sorts of carcinogenic chemicals to which he might have been exposed long ago even for short periods. On the other hand, a person who does not have cancer is unlikely to remember any such exposures. Secondly, the person who is recording the data might also question the cases more intensively than the controls for exposure to the risk factor. Both these sources of bias might be avoided by two precautions. First, the information about exposure should be collected from multiple sources: not just by questioning the subjects, but also from relevant documents and from the interviews with relatives of the subjects. Secondly, both the subjects and interviewer may be blinded about the purpose of the study. While ethical considerations require that the subject be informed about the general nature of the study, it is quite acceptable not to tell the patient the exact risk factor(s) being investigated.</p>
<p class="indent">In spite of all their pitfalls and drawbacks, case-control studies are popular because they are relatively convenient, inexpensive, and give quick results. The last of these advantages has academic as well as public health importance because of the nature of the health problems currently asking for a solution. The major unresolved public health problems today are diseases which result from slow accumulation of damage over a long period of time, such as hypertension, coronary artery disease, diabetes, osteoporosis and cancer. Cohort studies for evaluation of risk factors for these diseases have to go on for decades. On the other hand, case-control studies on these topics can provide quick answers to questions relevant to public health.<a name="page94"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">94</span></span></p>
<div class="section" id="ch7lev3sec2"><h3 class="title">Interpreting Case-control Studies</h3>
<p class="noindent">The results of case-control studies are expressed in terms of the <span class="italic">odds ratio.</span> Unlike cohort studies, case-control studies are handicapped by ignorance about the incidence of disease in exposed and non-exposed groups. Therefore, the relative risk cannot be calculated. What can be done, however, is that we can calculate the odds that a person having the disease (case) has been exposed to the risk factor.</p>
<p class="indent">Suppose among the cases, P have been exposed to the risk factor and Q have not been. Then, the odds that a case has been exposed to the risk factor are P/Q (<a href="#ch7fig3" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 7.3</a>.).</p>
<p class="indent">Suppose among the controls, R have been exposed to the risk factor and S have been not been. Then, the odds that a control has been exposed to the risk factor are R/S.</p>
<p class="indent">Odds ratio is the ratio of the two odds calculated above. Hence, in the above example,</p>
<div class="informalfigure"><img alt="" src="/MediumImage/94-1.jpg"></div>
<p class="indent">If the suspected risk factor actually poses a major risk for the disease, in the cases, P will be greater than Q, and in the controls, S will be greater than R. If both the values in the numerator are greater than both the values in the denominator, odds ratio will be greater than one. Thus odds ratio can be taken as an index of the degree of risk posed by the risk factor. That is why the odds ratio is sometimes also called the ‘estimated relative risk’.</p>
<div class="figure" id="ch7fig3" data-label="Fig. 7.3"><div class="title"><span class="item-label">Fig. 7.3</span> Assuming that the hypothesized risk factor is genuine, a case control study would reveal that among the cases, those who were exposed (P) are greater in number than those who were not (Q). In the control group, the situation is likely to be just the opposite. The odds ratio = PS/QR. For details, see the text</div><img alt="Fig. 7.3" src="/MediumImage/94-2.jpg"><div class="additional-markup"></div></div>
<p class="noindent"><a name="page95"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">95</span></span>In case of cohort studies, the calculated index is simply called relative risk because it is based on actual observation of incidence of disease. In case of case-control studies, disease incidence has not been observed. Therefore, the computed index (odds ratio) is only an ‘estimate’ of the relative risk.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch7lev2sec5"><h2 class="title">Closing Thoughts on Risk Assessment</h2>
<p class="noindent">For evaluation of risk posed by a factor, the best are cohort studies, next come case-control studies, and the least reliable are prevalence studies. But the common dictum, what is good is not easy, and what is easy is not good, applies here exactly. Case-control studies are a golden mean, not the best, but reasonably reliable; not the easiest, but feasible. If in a prevalence study, data is collected about exposure to a risk factor, odds ratio can be calculated in the same way as in case of case-control studies.</p>
<p class="indent">Exactly the same study designs which are used for evaluating the impact of risk factors can also be used for evaluating the degree of protection offered by protective factors such as physical exercise or green leafy vegetables. In these cases, ‘exposure’ to protective factors is expected to yield a relative risk or odds ratio of less than 1.</p>
</div>
</div><div class="section" id="ch7lev1sec3"><h1 class="title">STUDY OF PROGNOSTIC FACTORS</h1>
<p class="noindent">Prognosis refers to the future course of a disease. Two terms are often used for describing the future course of a disease: natural history and clinical course. Natural history of a disease is the sequence of events that unfolds in the absence of any medical intervention. Clinical course is the course the disease runs if appropriate medical care is provided. For example, the natural histories of typhoid or diabetes mellitus are very different from their clinical course. Whether it is natural history or clinical course, every patient does not have exactly the same destiny. The future course of the disease is modified by known, and often many unknown, prognostic factors. Knowledge of the impact of various prognostic factors enables us to predict the likely future course of illness in a given patient. In a disease like cancer, the prediction may be in terms of how long the patient is likely to live. But prediction may be in terms other than survival, such as whether the course of the disease will be, on the whole, uphill, downhill, or will it be characterized by relapses and remissions, and whether there are known factors which affect the frequency of relapses or the duration of remissions. The patient may also want to know whether the disease is likely to turn painful, or likely to affect his ability to walk, talk, eat, see, hear, or take care of himself without assistance: in short, how will his quality of life be affected over time. Doctors do <a name="page96"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">96</span></span>not have answers to all these questions for all the diseases, and that is why studies on prognosis are needed.</p>
<p class="indent">Prognostic factors are generally evaluated through cohort studies. A group of patients having the same disease of the same severity, stage, duration, etc. are assembled, and followed up. If some factor is suspected to be of prognostic significance, two groups of patients are assembled, similar in every respect, except that the prognostic factor being investigated is present in one group but not in the other. The time at which the study is begun is called zero time. The follow-up after zero time should be long enough for the outcomes of interest to occur. The outcomes of interest may be clinical or scientific, such as reversal of hepatomegaly, or improvement in blood chemistry; or more patient-oriented such as ‘becoming ambulatory again’.</p>
<p class="indent">A major pitfall of prognostic studies is that the two groups may not be exactly similar. This cannot be achieved by randomization in these studies because the allocation to groups is based on the presence or absence of the prognostic factor being investigated. Matching of the two groups is useful, but it is difficult to match for more than two or three factors, and the factors usually chosen (age and sex) are not necessarily the most important from the prognostic angle. Yet another strategy for achieving similar groups is to have rigid and well-defined inclusion and exclusion criteria: this strategy is called restriction. Restriction might make it difficult to enlist enough subjects; moreover, it also reduces the generalizability of the study. Some strategies to overcome the errors arising from dissimilarity of groups can be applied after data collection. One of these is stratification, i.e. dividing each group into sub-groups based on the presence or absence of some factors other than the prognostic factor being investigated. This strategy might help in getting pointers to some additional prognostic factors as well, and thereby multiplies the value of the study. Yet another strategy used by statisticians after collection of data is to ‘adjust’ for the effect of extraneous factors: this can be done simultaneously for several factors (multivariate adjustment). All these methods are not mutually exclusive: several of these can be used in the same study to reduce or neutralize the unequal representation of extraneous factors in the two groups being followed up.</p>
<p class="indent">Another pitfall of prognostic studies is that the patients are generally enlisted in hospital settings. These patients may not be truly representative of all the persons who get the disease. The sample available in the hospital is biased in favour of a particular geographical area, and sometimes also a narrow range of socio-economic status.<a name="page97"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">97</span></span></p>
<p class="indent">Further, in case of diseases which kill rapidly (e.g. myocardial infraction), the sample coming to the hospital might represent the fortunate few who survived long enough to reach the hospital. Studying only the patients reaching the hospital would miss the prognostic factors which determine whether the patient dies rapidly, or lives long enough to reach the hospital. Conversely, in case of diseases characterized by self-healing or long remissions, the patients coming to the hospital represent the unfortunate few in whom the disease persists.</p>
<p class="indent">Another source of error in prognostic studies involving long follow-ups is that the initial classification may not hold throughout. A person who was assigned to a group based on the absence of a given prognostic factor might come to have the factor present during the follow-up, or the other way round. Further, some patients who get lost to follow-up might become impossible to trace. The characteristics of patients who drop out might differ from those who continue in ways that are important to the outcome of the study.</p>
<p class="indent">Finally, errors might creep into the study at the level of measurement. To avoid these, first, the person making the measurements of outcomes should be blind regarding the groups to which the patient belongs. Secondly, even subjective outcomes, such as quality of life, should be measured through well-designed questionnaires which allow objective scoring.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch7lev2sec6"><h2 class="title">Survival Analysis</h2>
<p class="noindent">Suppose we wish to find out what percentage of patients having a disease (e.g. Stage 3 breast cancer) are alive after 5 years (5-year survival). A simple way to answer this question is to start with a cohort of such patients, follow them up for 5 years, record each death as and when it occurs, and plot the data as shown in <a href="#ch7fig4" class="ulink-inter">Figure 7.4</a>. If we wish to study also the impact of a prognostic factor (e.g. age), we can start with two cohorts: one below 50, and another above 50 years of age, and after 5 years we may get curves as shown in <a href="#ch7fig5" class="ulink-inter">Figure 7.5</a>, showing that 5-year survival is better in younger patients. However, there is one major difficulty with this simple approach. It is generally impossible to follow <span class="italic">all</span> the patients for 5 years. Some may be lost to follow-up due to change of residence or some other reason, and their fate may remain unknown to the investigators. To overcome this problem, Kaplan and Meier came up with a method of analysing such data which is known by their name.<a name="page98"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">98</span></span></p>

<p class="indent">The data given in <a href="#ch7tbl2" class="ulink-inter">Table 7.2</a> are an example of very bad research: they are based on a cohort of only 15 patients, and within 10 months, 8 patients have been lost to follow-up! Such data are fit only for the dustbin, but here they have been used for the sake of simplicity. It may be noted that, first, what we get in the end is not actual survival but only the probability of survival based on the assumption that patients who have been lost to follow up would have followed the same trend as those available. Secondly, the data at the beginning of the study are more reliable than those collected towards the end because in the end we are left with very few patients. In spite of these drawbacks, Kaplan-Meier analysis is very useful and widely used because it enables us to deal with the very real problem of drop outs. Further, if we start with a big cohort of patients, and the drop outs are relatively few, the analysis gives pretty reliable results. The data from <a href="#ch7tbl2" class="ulink-inter">Table 7.2</a> has been plotted in the conventional manner in <a href="#ch7fig6" class="ulink-inter">Figure 7.6</a>.</p>

<div class="section" id="ch7lev2sec7"><h2 class="title">To Tell or Not to Tell</h2>
<p class="noindent">When a person is diagnosed as having cancer, he generally wants to know how long he will live. In response, some doctors have a tendency to make a prediction based on survival curves; they generally tell the patient the period for which there is a 50% probability of survival. The reason why this practice is considered justifiable is that the patient should know the truth; an additional unstated reason is that it makes the doctor look competent. However, the practice fails on both these counts. The patient should know the truth, but why only part of the truth? Doesn't the same survival curve which tells that only 50% of the patients are alive after one year, sometime, also tell that 10% of the patients are alive even after 5 years? How can the doctor know that the patient in front of him is one of those who will die after one year, not one of those who will be alive even after 5 years? If the doctor truly believes that all his patients are at the 50% survival level, he cannot be considered very competent either. What makes these comments important is the realization that has grown particularly during the last few decades that the period of survival is <span class="italic">not</span> a random event. That the survival would depend on the type of tumor and its stage is understandable. But what is interesting is that survival depends also on who has the tumor and what the patient believes in. After the surgery and other conventional methods of treatment have removed <a name="page101"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">101</span></span>bulk of the tumor from the body, the tumor cells that still remain in the body can be eliminated by the patient's own immune system. Advances in psychoneuroimmunology have generated enough evidence to suggest strongly that the efficiency with which the patient's immune system is able to do so would depend on what is going on in the patient's mind. This contention is further borne out by the studies which show that patients with a positive attitude and a robust fighting spirit, and those who receive the benefit of some psychosocial intervention, survive longer than control patients who receive only conventional medical treatment (Spiegel et al 1989). In short, predicting the survival of an individual patient on the basis of statistics is wrong. Statistics apply to populations, not to individuals. Further, a patient who treats the doctor's prediction as God's word may oblige by dying on schedule, although with a more optimistic attitude he could have lived longer (Siegel 1990).</p>
<p class="indent">What, then, should the doctor do? Should he deny the truth to the patient? No, the truth must be told; the important thing is how the truth is told. First, there is no harm in admitting to the patient that nobody can tell exactly how long he will live. Secondly, he should be told that while some patients die quite early, many live long and even overcome the disease so well that they die a few decades later of something quite unrelated to cancer. Finally, he should be told that this is a battle in which the patient also has to participate. What the doctor does will do only part of the job; the rest of the job has to be done by the patient and his family by creating a positive outlook and a cheerful atmosphere. All these are scientifically validated truths, and expressing them in this fashion has a very desirable placebo effect.<sup><a href="#ch7fn1" class="ulink-inter">1</a></sup> Incorporating the mind-body approach in the treatment of cancer, and using spiritual disciplines like yoga for influencing the patient's mind positively, are now an integral part of mainstream scientific medicine (Bijlani 2003).</p>

</div><div class="section" id="ch7lev1sec4"><h1 class="title">WRITING A SYSTEMATIC REVIEW</h1>
<p class="noindent">Writing a review which integrates existing knowledge on a topic and evaluates it critically is a time-honored tradition in science.</p>
<p class="">_____________</p>
<p class="noindent"><sup class="footnote" id="ch7fn1">[<a href="#d1e5844">16</a>]</sup></p>
<p class="noindent"><a name="page102"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">102</span></span>But since 1990 there has been an explosive growth in reviews which are based on attempts to retrieve all available studies on a subject and combine data from these studies using statistical techniques. The resulting conclusions are more precise and powerful than from any of the single studies which have been incorporated in the review. Such reviews are called systematic reviews. In evidence-based medicine, a systematic review has been considered the highest level of evidence.</p>
<p class="indent">It is tempting to believe that writing a systematic review may be only slightly more difficult than the traditional narrative review. But, in fact, the time, effort and resources required for writing a systematic review are comparable to those for conducting an original study. Therefore, preparation of a systematic review requires planning, and one should embark upon it only if the necessary resources are available. Most of the systematic reviews written so far have synthesized information from randomized controlled trials, but there are reviews based on other categories of studies as well. A systematic review may synthesize information from cohort and case-control studies which study risk or prognostic factors, or it may integrate studies which have compared a new diagnostic test with a standard established test.</p>
<p class="indent">Systematic reviews are extremely important today because of the overwhelming increase in the volume of biomedical research. It has become almost impossible for anyone to stay abreast of all the latest research on the area of his interest. Further, the quality of published research is highly variable. Finally, single studies rarely provide definitive answers to controversies. Therefore medical practice or policies cannot be founded on single studies, no matter how well conducted. Systematic reviews have provided an acceptable answer to all these difficulties. The steps involved in planning and preparing a systematic review have been discussed briefly below, and you would observe that they bear a remarkable resemblance to the steps which primary research follows.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch7lev2sec8"><h2 class="title">Formulating the Question</h2>
<p class="noindent">This is a crucial first step. Since a systematic review is a major commitment, the question should be worth answering, and should be framed clearly and in sufficient detail.</p>
<p class="noindent">Examples of a few such questions are:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p class="">Does adding yoga to conventional treatment improve glycemic control in non-insulin dependent diabetes?</p></li>
<li><p class="">Does routine addition of MRI to a CT scan in every case of headache improve diagnostic accuracy significantly?<a name="page103"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">103</span></span></p></li>
<li><p class="">Does the addition of chemotherapy to surgery enhance quality-adjusted life years significantly as compared to surgery alone in estrogen receptor-positive stage II breast cancer?</p></li>
<li><p class="">Is 6-monthly administration of a high dose of Vitamin A to every child below ten in India more cost-effective than health education for prevention of malnutrition-related blindness?</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="indent">These are questions, answers to which may influence clinical decisions or government policies in an important way, and a large volume of research of variable quality is likely to be already available on these topics in published literature. Therefore, the synthesis of information from <span class="italic">all</span> good quality published studies is likely to provide a much more definitive answer than yet one more original study.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch7lev2sec9"><h2 class="title">Deciding on Studies to be Included</h2>
<p class="noindent">The studies are the ‘subjects’ of a systematic review. Therefore, appropriate inclusion and exclusion criteria should be framed based on the following considerations:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p class="">How far back will the review go: e.g. it may be decided that all studies conducted after 1966 will be considered for inclusion<sup><a href="#ch7fn2" class="ulink-inter">2</a></sup>.</p></li>
<li><p class="">What type of studies will be included: e.g. if the review is on a modality of prevention or treatment, will only randomized controlled trials be included; or if the review is on risk factors, will only cohort or case-control studies, or both, be included?<sup><a href="#ch7fn3" class="ulink-inter">3</a></sup></p></li>
<li><p class="">Criteria by which the studies will be screened so that only good quality studies get included in the review.<sup><a href="#ch7fn4" class="ulink-inter">4</a></sup></p></li>
<li><p class="">How one will handle multiple publications from the same study. For example, a preliminary report might be published after a one year follow up, and another one after a five year follow up. Since the population studied is the same, it is proper only to include the 5-year follow up. Or, if the first report includes fewer subjects than the second one, the subjects of the first report have been included in the second report. Hence once again only the second report needs to be included. All multiple publications might not be so clear cut, and may, therefore, need a close look for a decision. Including results from the same study more than once may bias the conclusions of the review unduly in favour of the data from this study.</p>
<p class="">_____________</p>
<p class="noindent"><sup class="footnote" id="ch7fn2">[<a href="#d1e5937">17</a>]</sup></p>
<p class="noindent"><sup class="footnote" id="ch7fn3">[<a href="#d1e5944">18</a>]</sup></p>
<p class="noindent"><sup class="footnote" id="ch7fn4">[<a href="#d1e5951">19</a>]</sup></p>
<p class="noindent"><sup class="footnote" id="ch7fn5">[<a href="#d1e5958">20</a>]</sup></p></li>
<li><p class=""><a name="page104"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">104</span></span>Whether only full reports in journals will be included, or whether abstracts, proceedings of conferences, book chapters, dissertations, and unpublished work available with individual scientists also be included. Here it may be noted that such work is not necessarily bad in quality. Further it has been observed that only about one-third of abstracts get published as full reports within 5 years. Thus ignoring abstracts might miss a considerable volume of good research.<sup><a href="#ch7fn5" class="ulink-inter">5</a></sup></p></li>
<li><p class="">Whether only research available in the English language will be used, or efforts will be made to obtain research published in other languages and get it translated: this is a difficult question because if non-English language literature is ignored, some good research may be missed; if it is included, the resources required for preparing the review are much greater.</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch7lev2sec10"><h2 class="title">Search for Articles</h2>
<p class="noindent">The most productive method is to use electronic databases, of which MEDLINE is available free on the internet and has the largest collection. It can be accessed through PubMed. The search can produce two types of problems. First, it may not give all the relevant references – this problem can be solved by using alternative Medical Subject Headings (MeSH). Second, it may give too many references, many of them irrelevant to the systematic review – this problem can be solved by using strategies which limit the search. Some training in expert features of PubMed can be very useful in making the most efficient use of the database. Another important resource, specially designed for systematic reviews, is the Cochrane Library. It has a register of controlled trials, guidelines on preparation of systematic reviews, and it also helps disseminate the results of systematic reviews. For access to European research, EMBASE is the best database. Then there are other databases dedicated to specific topics, such as AIDSLINE, CANCERLIT and TOXLINE.<a name="page105"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">105</span></span></p>
<p class="indent">Additional literature may be accessed by a manual search of journals and monographs, study of references cited by the selected articles, contacting individual institutions and investigators, etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch7lev2sec11"><h2 class="title">Retrieving Articles</h2>
<p class="noindent">Search for references, screening for selection, and getting hold of the full text of articles are overlapping processes. In some cases, looking at the title may be enough to reject the article. In some cases, only on seeing the full text one may realise that the article does not satisfy the inclusion criteria. The aim is to first get hold of <span class="italic">all</span> the relevant literature on the subject.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch7lev2sec12"><h2 class="title">Selecting Articles</h2>
<p class="noindent">Selecting articles for inclusion in the systematic review from amongst those retrieved may seem a simple task because inclusion and exclusion criteria have already been laid down. But in practice it is not so simple because of the discretion available in interpretation of the criteria. Everything else being equal, an investigator screening the articles is more likely to select than reject an article from a reputed institution by a well-known scientist published in a good journal which has reported positive results, or the type of results which the screening investigator believes in. On the other hand, an article which lacks some of these features might be looked at more critically, almost as if the purpose of the screening is to find a reason for excluding the article. Three remedies have been suggested for overcoming this type of prejudices:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p class="">Blinding: The names of authors, institutions and journal may be erased before the articles are provided to the person responsible for screening them.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Task separation: The articles may be split into two parts – Introduction and Methods in one part, and Results and Discussion in the other part. The results of screening should be based primarily on the first part. Further, the two parts should be seen with a reasonable gap of time so that one is unlikely to link them mentally.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Independent screening by two or more persons: There are obvious practical difficulties associated with ‘blinding’ and ‘task separation’. Therefore, the most commonly used method to avoid selection bias is to have two or more persons screen the articles independently. They should record the attributes of each article with respect to <a name="page106"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">106</span></span>inclusion and exclusion criteria in a proforma. In cases of disagreement<sup><a href="#ch7fn6" class="ulink-inter">6</a></sup>, the persons involved may have a discussion to arrive at a consensus, or the articles may be screened by a third person as well.</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch7lev2sec13"><h2 class="title">Collecting Data from Articles</h2>
<p class="noindent">The data from individual articles should be recorded on carefully designed forms. That makes the task both convenient and thorough. The recording, filing and storage of the data should be just as meticulous as in an original study. The results in an article are often given not only in the ‘Results’ section, but to some extent also in the ‘Abstract’ and the ‘Discussion’. In case of a discrepancy in the results in different sections of the article (it is surprisingly common!), the authors should be contacted for clarification.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch7lev2sec14"><h2 class="title">Pooling the Data</h2>
<p class="noindent">There are two basic conditions for pooling of data to be appropriate. First, the studies should be similar in design and execution. No two studies are exactly alike, but at least the essentials of the studies from which the data are derived for pooling should be similar. <span class="italic">Second,</span> the results of these studies should be homogeneous. Homogeneous here means that the results should be at least in the same direction. It is meaningless to pool data from studies with contradictory results, let them cancel each other out, and conclude on a neutral note!</p>
<div class="section" id="ch7lev3sec4"><h3 class="title">Meta-analysis</h3>
<p class="noindent">The systematic review is itself sometimes called a meta-analysis. But, strictly speaking, meta-analysis is the term used for pooling of data from several studies using appropriate statistical techniques. Although the statistical techniques for pooling of data started evolving in the 1930s, the term meta-analysis was coined by Glass in 1976. In 1987-88, three articles appeared almost simultaneously in leading journals on how to do a meta-analysis (L'Abbe et at 1987, Sacks et al 1987, Bulpitt 1988). Following that, there has been an exponential growth in the publication of meta-analyses.</p>
<p class="indent">In general, pooling of binary (dichotomous) data (e.g. alive vs. dead) should aim at calculation of a single figure for number needed to treat (NNT), risk ratio or odds ratio.</p>
<p class="">_____________</p>
<p class="noindent"><sup class="footnote" id="ch7fn6">[<a href="#d1e6064">21</a>]</sup></p>
<p class="noindent"><a name="page107"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">107</span></span>On the other hand, the pooling of continuous data should aim at the calculation of a single figure for effect size (standardized mean difference) or the correlation coefficient between two variables.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch7lev3sec5"><h3 class="title">Handling Heterogeneity</h3>
<p class="noindent">It was mentioned earlier that only homogeneous data should be pooled. What if data are not homogeneous? Heterogeneity should not be ignored but explored. Pool only homogeneous data, and study in detail the studies which do not fit in to find reasons and explanations for the heterogeneity. After all, the non-conforming studies are also good quality studies which have been selected on the basis of pre-determined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Therefore, they cannot be ignored, and plausible explanations must be found for their results being different. The explanations may generate hypotheses for further research.</p>
<p class="indent">If the number of studies with contradictory results is quite large on either side of the divide, one may be able to discover some consistent differences in patient characteristics or study characteristics which explain the contradiction. In that case, data from different sub-groups may be pooled separately.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch7lev2sec15"><h2 class="title">Drawing Conclusions</h2>
<p class="noindent">Finally, from the pooled data, conclusions may be drawn. In general, these conclusions are more dependable than those based on any of the individual studies included in the systematic review.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch7lev2sec16"><h2 class="title">Closing Words on Systematic Reviews</h2>
<p class="noindent">Systematic reviews are a summary of what we know, and what we still do not know, about a topic. In controversial areas, they provide a balanced and reasonably objective view of the direction in which current knowledge is pointing. They are the best available resource for the practice of evidence-based medicine. They can be used for addressing sharply defined clinical questions or policy issues requiring a difficult decision. The techniques used for such tasks, closely related to meta-analysis, are called decision analysis and cost-effectiveness analysis. Systematic reviews also have great relevance to medical education. First, these reviews go beyond the textbook in providing the latest consensus on a contentious issue because, besides the knowledge in textbooks being somewhat outdated, the textbook verdict on controversies is based on expert opinion of the author <a name="page108"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">108</span></span>rather than a meta-analysis of <span class="italic">all</span> available evidence. Second, participating in the preparation of a systematic review can be a very good academic exercise for a postgraduate student.</p>
<p class="aligncenter"><bold>QUESTION</bold></p>
<p class="noindent">What is the difference between meta-analysis and secondary analysis?</p>
<p class="aligncenter"><bold>ANSWER</bold></p>
<p class="noindent">Meta-analysis is secondary research, but it is different from secondary analysis. Secondary analysis means looking at the data of a primary research study once again from a different angle. For example, in a series of studies involving glucose or meal tolerance tests, it was observed that, in general, in a given subject the tolerance seemed to be a shade worse on the first test than on subsequent tests. A secondary analysis done on the data from this angle confirmed this impression (Bijlani et al 1992). Another example: in 1975, Meyer Friedman and Ray Rosenman discovered an association between Type A personality and coronary heart disease (Rosenman et al 1975). There were problems with replicating the original findings (Shekelle et al 1985). The controversy was resolved when secondary analysis of Friedman and Rosenman's data revealed, as had a few other studies, that it is ‘hostility’ rather than other features of the type A personality that are associated with coronary heart disease (Hecker et al 1988).</p>
