<p class="noindent">Before the seventeenth century, the goals of science were wisdom, understanding the natural order, and living in harmony with it. In the seventeenth century this attitude, which one would call an ecological attitude, changed into its opposite. Ever since Bacon the goal of science has been knowledge that can be used to dominate and control nature, and today both science and technology are used predominantly for purposes that are dangerous, harmful, and anti-ecological.</p>

<p class="noindent">Smart people spend time alone. They don't fill their days with appointments from 8 am to 10 pm, as many politicians and executives do. Great science does not emerge from hard logic and grinding hours. It comes from the mysterious resources of the human brain and soul. Inspiration is nurtured by activities like chopping wood and raking leaves, preparing dinner and reading to the kids. These activities soften the rigid pace of the day's pursuits and allow all our God-given intuition to work its unlogical magic. Only then can we reach our fullest potential. Only then can we leap from thinking to understanding.</p>

<p class="noindent">It is now proved that in science India went farther than any country before the modern era, and even Europe owes the beginning of her physical science to India as much as to Greece, although not directly but through the medium of the Arabs.</p>

<p class="noindent">Not only was India in the first rank in mathematics, astronomy, chemistry, medicine, surgery, all the branches of physical knowledge which were practiced in ancient times, but she was, along with the Greeks, the teacher of the Arabs from whom Europe recovered the lost habit of scientific enquiry and got the basis from which modern science started.</p>
<p class="alignright"><span class="italic">—SRI AUROBINDO</span></p>
<p class="noindent">In many directions India had the priority of discovery, — to take only two striking examples among a multitude, the decimal notation in mathematics or the perception that the earth is a moving body in astronomy, — <span class="italic">chala prthvi sthira bhati,</span> the earth moves and only appears to be still, said the Indian astronomer many centuries before Galileo.</p>

<p class="noindent">Science at its limits, even physical science, is compelled to perceive in the end the infinite, the universal, the spirit, the divine intelligence and will in the material universe.</p>
<p class="alignright"><span class="italic">—SRI AUROBINDO</span></p>
<p class="noindent">The beginning of science is the examination of the truths of the world-force that underlie its apparent workings such as our senses represent them to be; the beginning of philosophy is the examination of the principles of things which the senses mistranslate to us; the beginning of spiritual knowledge is the refusal to accept the limitations of the sense-life or to take the visible and sensible as anything more than phenomenon of the Reality.</p>
<p class="alignright"><span class="italic">—SRI AUROBINDO</span></p>
<p class="noindent">What Science does for our knowledge of the material world, replacing first appearances and uses by the hidden truths and as yet occult powers of its great natural forces and in our own minds beliefs and opinions by verified experience and a profounder understanding, Yoga does for the higher planes and worlds and possibilities of our being which are aimed at by the religions.</p>
<p class="alignright"><span class="italic">—SRI AUROBINDO</span></p>

<p class="alignright"><span class="italic">—FRITJOF CAPRA</span></p>
<p class="noindent">The mystic looks within and explores his or her consciousness at its various levels, which include the body as the physical manifestation of the mind. … … In contrast to the mystic, the physicist begins his enquiry into the essential nature of things by studying the material world. … … the mystic and the physicist arrive at the same conclusion; one starting from the inner realm, the other from the outer world. The harmony between their views confirms the ancient Indian wisdom that <span class="italic">Brahman,</span> the ultimate reality without, is identical to <span class="italic">Atman,</span> the reality within.</p>
<p class="alignright"><span class="italic">—FRITJOF CAPRA</span></p>
<p class="noindent">I see science and mysticism as two complementary manifestations of the human mind; of its rational and intuitive faculties.</p>
<p class="alignright"><span class="italic">—FRITJOF CAPRA</span></p>
<p class="noindent">Although their theories are leading to a world view which is similar to that of the mystics, it is striking how little it has affected the attitudes of most scientists.

<p class="noindent">A long and hard struggle was necessary to establish natural science as an independent mode of inquiry, free of the tyranny of theology and the church, which had been coupled with temporal power.
