If it is a medical subject, the next milestone is inevitably Galen (200 A.D.), a physician of Green origin working for the Roman emperor, Marcus Aurelius. Then, after a gap of about 1500 years, termed the Dark Age, we jump to the 17th or 18th century. After that there is no looking back; only steady progress. Taking off more or less from where the Greeks and Romans had left it, we find uninterrupted spectacular progress at a rate unprecedented in the history of mankind, culminating in where we stand today. As we contemplate the phenomenal achievements of modern science, we, as Indians, cannot but feel hurt by the fact that the scene of these achievements has been primarily Europe, which has now been joined by North America. India is nowhere in the picture. We might respond by saying that these accounts have been written by prejudiced Western historians. We may also point out, quite correctly, that much before the Greek civilization, we had brilliant scientists such as Aryabhata, Bhaskara, Charaka and Susruta, who are completely ignored by these historians. While that is true, the fact remains that modern science is essentially the product of the European Renaissance, the beginning of which has been arbitrarily fixed in the year 1543 by Charles Singer (Singer 1958).<sup><a href="#ch19fn1" class="ulink-inter">1</a></sup></p><p>________________</p><p><sup class="footnote" id="ch19fn1">[<a href="#d1e11903">46</a>]</sup></p><p><a name="page266"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">266</span></span>Taking away all the scientific discoveries made in India during the last 500 years, including those made after independence, will inflict no serious damage on modern science. This is in spite of the fact that after independence there has been a mushroom growth of science colleges in the country. The result is that although India has only one-sixth of the world's population, it has one-third of the world's scientific manpower. Why is it that in spite of having so many scientists, we do not have top quality scientific research in the country?</p><div class="section" id="ch19lev1sec1"><h1 class="title">THE USUAL SCAPEGOATS</h1>
<p>Now we shall discuss some of the usual explanations given for our backwardness in original scientific activity.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch19lev2sec1"><h2 class="title">Our Culture</h2>
<p>It is often said that we are a spiritual country, and therefore perform poorly in worldly activities such as science. This argument, although specious, is very weak. Let us examine the holes and cracks in our spiritual armour.</p>
<p>There is enough evidence to show that India originated much of the world's mathematics, astronomy, philosophy, linguistics and technology until about 700 A.D. (Nadkarni 2006). Until about the 10th century, our science and technology was at par with the best in the world. That is why, Arabian science, which was at its peak around the 10th century, borrowed at least as much from India as from Greece. The Unani Tibb is essentially an amalgam of Ayurveda and Greek medicine. The situation started changing in the 14th century when Europe started recovering from its fear of the Arabian empire as well as domination by the Church. India had by then started losing its vitality. It is because we lost our vitality that we were invaded and conquered, and the rest is history.</p>
<p>When India was the world leader in science, it was no less spiritual than it is today. Further, the West today is no less spiritual than India. If by spirituality we mean belief in a common spirit pervading all creation in the universe, behaviour reflecting that belief is more visible in the West than in India. Examples of such behaviour are dedication to duty, respecting the environment, humanitarian help to victims of disasters, and even a simple thing such as being in a queue happily and voluntarily rather than trying to jump the queue.<sup><a href="#ch19fn2" class="ulink-inter">2</a></sup> Finally, a world-negating spirituality was never the Indian ideal.</p>
<p>________________</p>
<p><sup class="footnote" id="ch19fn2">[<a href="#d1e11941">47</a>]</sup></p>
<p><a name="page267"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">267</span></span>A balanced approach to life was not a monopoly of the Greeks as is now commonly stated – the Indian ideal, formulated long before the Greek civilization, was a balanced pursuit of <span class="italic">kama</span> (desires), <span class="italic">artha</span> (the means to fulfill desires), <span class="italic">dharma</span> (right conduct, within the framework of which <span class="italic">karma</span> and <span class="italic">artha</span> had to be pursued) and <span class="italic">moksha</span> (spiritual liberation) (Aurobindo 1971). Thus there is no basic conflict between science and spirituality. In the West, the Renaissance scientists came in conflict with the Church because many of their findings contradicted some statements in the Bible. But India, being the cradle of non-dogmatic insight-based (not revelation-based) religions, has been free of such conflicts.</p>
<p>In short, Indian spirituality is inherently life-affirming, and does not prevent us from pursuing science. The dichotomy between spirituality and worldly action in India paralleled the overall decadence of its inherent culture which began about a thousand years ago. In recent times, Swami Vivekananda, Mahatma Gandhi and Sri Aurobindo have been powerful advocates of bringing spirituality into worldly action. Spirituality and external activity are not just compatible; a spiritual attitude enriches external action by taking away from it elements of egoism, selfishness and greed, and adding to it the motive of consecration.</p>

<h2 class="title">THE INDIA THAT WAS</h2>
<p>In civil engineering, metal technologies, textiles, shipping and ship-building, water harvesting systems, forest management, farming techniques, traditional medical systems – in each one of these subjects India has a fund of traditional knowledge which for long has been dismissed as mere folklore and superstition. We can see from the planning of complex towns of the Saraswati-Sindhu civilization to Delhi's Qutub Minar that India's indigenous technologies were very sophisticated in design, planning, water supply, traffic flow, natural air-conditioning, complex stone work, and construction engineering. Indian textile exports were legendary. Roman archives contain official complaints about massive cash drainage because of imports of fine Indian muslin. Our navigation system was famous throughout the world because India had a thriving ocean trade system for centuries before the Europeans arrived on the scene. You will be surprised to know that Vasco da Gama's ships, which discovered the trade route to India, were captained by a Gujarati sailor.</p>

<div class="section" id="ch19lev2sec2"><h2 class="title">Our Slavery</h2>
<p>As pointed out above, we were enslaved because we had started losing our vitality. It is also true that enslavement led to further degeneration. It was India's wealth that attracted the conquerors; by the time the British left, they made sure that India would be counted among the poorest countries of the world. What is relevant to the <a name="page268"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">268</span></span>present discussion is the fact that the British impoverished us not only materially but also intellectually; it is the latter which is more important in the present context. The decadent phase of its culture that India was going through, together with their ignorance of India's rich cultural heritage and the arrogance that comes naturally to a ruler had convinced the British that Indians were a primitive and barbaric tribe, and that they had been sent here by Providence to civilize us.</p>
<p>Thomas Macaulay, who designed our system of education, wrote in his famous Minute of 1835 that a single shelf of a good European library was worth the whole native literature of India and Arabia.<sup><a href="#ch19fn3" class="ulink-inter">3</a></sup> Accordingly, the system of education that they designed for us made us lose confidence in ourselves, filled us with an inferiority complex, and convinced us that our salvation lay in imitating the West. In any case, we have to remember that the education that they wanted Indians to get was meant to generate a supply of yes-men for the bureaucracy rather than to revive and reinforce our capacity for original and critical thinking. However, the past is dead and gone, and it does not help in any way to go on using the British as our whipping boy.<sup><a href="#ch19fn4" class="ulink-inter">4</a></sup> What is deplorable is that although we are politically free, we continue to be a colony of the West, intellectually and culturally (Nadkarni 2006). This is because we have not used our political freedom to make well-considered radical reforms in our system of education. For sixty years, we have continued to tinker with the system of education that the British left us. On the other hand, the system of education in Britain itself has been reformed beyond recognition in these sixty years. The ex-slaves have been more loyal to the system than the masters! The British deserve a pat on the back for devising a system that has been so successful in decimating us so completely.</p>

<div class="section" id="ch19lev2sec3"><h2 class="title">Our Working Conditions</h2>
<p>Many Indians are not as harsh in judging our system of education as I have been. They point out that the products of our system have a better handwriting, they know more facts, and are better at oral maths than the products of Western education. Young people in the West use a calculator in the grocery store even to add up the cost of two items, they point out. Some scientists blame not the system of education but the poor working conditions in our scientific institutions for the poor state of Indian science. In support of this, they point out that our scientists abroad, who are products of the same system of education, do extremely well. This argument is only partly valid. There will always be a few exceptional individuals who would beat any system of education and do well in spite of the system. It is also probably true that most of these exceptional individuals choose to go to the West because the working conditions there are better. But let us examine the issue a little more closely. There have been only two Nobel laureates of Indian origin in science over the last sixty years – Hargobind Khurana and S. Chandrashekhar. This is a dismal record, considering the number of scientists we have exported to the West over these sixty years.</p>
<p>All India Institute of Medical Sciences has existed for more than 50 years, and more than 50 per cent of its products are working in the West. Most of its products have done well in medical practice, relatively fewer are in academics, and still fewer are engaged in full-time research. Not even one of them has received the Nobel Prize, and those who have an outstanding international reputation in research can be counted on the finger tips of one hand. The best known AIIMSonian in USA today – Deepak Chopra – is known for the ingenious manner in which he has interpreted ancient Indian wisdom to the West and linked it to modern medicine, not for his scientific research. It is true that young Indian scientists are easily able to secure doctoral and post-doctoral positions in top American universities. But let us see what reputation they have in USA, and why they are received with open arms. In general, the reputation of Indian students there is that they know more facts than the native students, but are poorer at coming up with good original ideas. However, they are still welcomed because they know English better than the Chinese or Koreans; they are willing to work harder than the native students; they are soft-spoken and obedient; they know quite a few lab techniques, and are keen and willing to learn more; if taught a <a name="page270"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">270</span></span>technique, they pick it up fast and reproduce it exactly; and with a little training they can help write research grant applications and research papers. All these qualities make the young Indian scientist a precious pair of hands in the laboratory. With experience, these qualities may even take him to a professorial position one day. But these qualities are not enough for doing pathbreaking research. And, the handicap can be traced to the system of education the Indian scientist went through.</p>
</div>
</div><div class="section" id="ch19lev1sec2"><h1 class="title">INDIAN SCIENCE TODAY</h1>
<p>A famous saying tells us, as you sow, so shall you reap. The seeds of science education are sown in school. My first exposure to serious study of science was in Class IX. My school was not among the top schools of the town, but the interesting thing is that some students from the top schools used to migrate to my school in class IX. The reason was that the top schools were affiliated to ‘Senior Cambridge’ whereas my school was a ‘Higher Secondary’ school affiliated to the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE). And, the dominant public opinion then was that although English was taught better in Senior Cambridge schools, Science and Maths were taught better in CBSE schools. Let us see how I was taught science in class IX in a good school affiliated to the CBSE, where science was supposed to be taught better than in Senior Cambridge schools.</p>
<p>I entered class IX with a good deal of enthusiasm because although I had topped in class VIII, I hated studying history and geography which required several facts to be remembered. From class IX onwards I did not have to study history and geography; instead, I would be spending a lot of time studying science, about which I had a romantic picture. The picture roughly was that in science facts have to be understood rather than remembered, and study of science is not just about knowing facts but may also lead to discoveries which bring name and fame. But I was in for a rude shock within a few days of entering class IX. In the first class we had on chemistry, the teacher turned towards the blackboard as soon as he entered the class, and wrote on it ‘Sodium Na, Potasium K, Hydrogen H ……..’. After writing about 30 symbols and formulae, he announced that by the next class in chemistry we must know all this stuff by heart. In the first class we had on physics, the teacher wrote on the blackboard the definition of ‘force’, read it out, asked a couple of students to read it out, rubbed the definition off, and again asked a few students to repeat the definition. After a few students had done it successfully, he assumed that the class <a name="page271"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">271</span></span>knew what ‘force’ is, and proceeded to repeat the process with the definition of ‘velocity’.<sup><a href="#ch19fn5" class="ulink-inter">5</a></sup> The result was that I was confused, puzzled, depressed, and could not see what was going on. I failed in three consecutive class tests in science. Science seemed worse than history and geography: at least I had never failed in as many tests in those subjects. But somewhere deep within I knew that I was not being introduced to science properly. I decided to go to the school library. Luckily I found a few science books by Western authors which seemed good. I borrowed them one by one, and read primarily their ‘Prefaces’ and ‘Introductory Chapters’. My image of science being an interesting subject of study requiring thinking and reasoning rather than memory was confirmed. I returned to my books with renewed vigour, and started reading them with my own attitude to science. The result was that now I enjoyed the process of learning and knew my stuff. By the time I took my final exams in class IX, I had again floated to the top layer of the class, and stayed there throughout the subsequent studies.</p>
<p>If I look back and analyse the situation, I would find at least two faults with the system of science education that I had to go through. One, it encouraged the student to learn science the wrong way – i.e. by rote memory. Two, it did not inculcate the process by which new knowledge is generated. My response to the system was essentially a coping strategy. I learnt science the right way, but I gave the system what it wanted: it asked for facts, and I gave it facts, but I made the process easier and interesting by adopting a healthy learning style.</p>
<p>________________</p>
<p><sup class="footnote" id="ch19fn5">[<a href="#d1e12074">50</a>]</sup></p>
<p><sup class="footnote" id="ch19fn6">[<a href="#d1e12082">51</a>]</sup></p>
<p><a name="page272"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">272</span></span>But I could not change the system, and therefore did not learn much about the process of discovery except by reading some historical snippets from good books<sup><a href="#ch19fn6" class="ulink-inter">6</a></sup>. However, this much must be said in favour of the system that I not only survived it, but in fact thrived on it, in the sense that I did better than my friends who depended on rote memory for learning science. But the point is that the healthy learning style had to be discovered by the student by swimming against the current: the system did not encourage it. The result is that some crazy non-conformers with tremendous potential for scientific discovery, who neither cooperate with the system nor come up with a survival strategy, get eliminated because they score poorly in the exams. One wonders how many such seeds are lost because they do not get favourable conditions for germination.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<h2 class="title">CHEMICAL CHANTING</h2>
<p>During his early days in India, the renowned scientist JBS Haldane woke up one morning to the chanting of some loud rhyming sounds. He had heard that many Indians recite mantras early in the morning as part of the prayers, and assumed that these sounds must be some such mantras. But when he tried to hear the sounds carefully, he felt that the sounds were some chemical equations. He looked out of the window and discovered that the voice belonged to a young boy who was pacing up and down with a book in his hands. Haldane was shocked to see the way students (at least some!) learnt science in india.</p>
</div>
<p>The result is that essentially the first time that a medical scientist is expected to generate new knowledge is when he joins for MD or PhD. By this stage, not only he has not learnt anything about the process of research, but even his instinct for inquiry has been murdered by a system which has equated studying science with uncritical accumulation and recycling of known facts, and even for that he might have depended on rote memory. The result is that when an MD or PhD student is asked what he would like to work on, he starts fumbling for an answer. It does not take long to discover that the student does not look upon the course as an opportunity to answer some questions which have haunted him sometime in the past – there are no such questions. The fact is that he is interested in the degree, not in working on anything. He needs the degree because it would entitle him to a job much better than a mere MBBS or MSc degree would. And, to get the degree he is prepared to work on any topic the guide wants him to. Hence, after a little tete-a-tete through which the guide as well as the student have paid a formal tribute to the ideals of research and academic freedom, the topic of work is provided by the guide.</p>
<p>It is interesting that although the major component of a PhD course is research, the entrance examinations for admission to PhD assess the student essentially on recall of facts. Even the examiners do not seem to take this anomaly seriously, because if a student does not clear the entrance exam, they often advise him to read more and reappear after 6 months. What the student can do in 6 months is merely to accumulate more facts; it is too late and too short a period to acquire aptitude for research. Hence if a PhD student has an aptitude <a name="page273"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">273</span></span>for research, it is incidental; it is not there because of the way the entrance test was designed. That is why the weakness that handicaps PhD students the most is that, in general, their thinking is sloppy. They just cannot grasp the significance of controls, they cannot distinguish between facts and conjectures, they cannot go to the core of a study, and they have no feel for statistics. It is a nightmare to teach them how to read a graph properly, and to refrain from expressions such as ‘slight increase’ and ‘slight decrease’ when the change is not statistically significant. They simply have no intuitive grasp of the relationship between cause and effect, dependent and independent variables, or assertion and reason.<sup><a href="#ch19fn7" class="ulink-inter">7</a></sup></p>
<p>Once a student has been admitted to the PhD course, he works on a topic for a few years, writes the thesis, and if the examiners are satisfied with the thesis, he appears for the viva. It is in the viva that the weakness of our system of science education surfaces once again. If the student is asked why he chose one type of control for his experiments and not another, or which flaws did he discover in his work which he would like to correct if he had to repeat the study, one seldom gets good answers. The reason is that the student never asked such questions over the 5 years that he spent on his PhD, and does not even understand the significance of such questions. However, the examiners sometimes do ask such questions and feel superior; the student hangs his head and tries to seem ashamed and sorry. At the end of the viva, the examiners go through the usual arguments in their head: “the poor boy has worked hard for 5 years, written the thesis, and the examiners’ reports on the thesis are also satisfactory. You cannot fail him just because he could not answer a few questions in the viva.” Possibly the examiners think back and realise that even they could not have answered such questions at that stage. So, the student walks away with the highest degree a university can award after working as a glorified technician for 5 years.</p>

<p><a name="page274"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">274</span></span>He could do so because he somehow survived the system which eliminated some better-gifted individuals at earlier stages. Now his PhD will entitle him to better jobs. One day he will be a Professor or a senior scientist. Over time, he will get some training abroad, present work at international conferences, guide some students, and in the process get polished. But because of the initial weaknesses of the system he went through, his work will remain second rate. No matter what the quantity of the work is, second rate work will not make India a leader in science.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<h2 class="title">WHAT KILLS CREATIVITY?</h2>
<p><span class="italic">Ramesh Bijlani</span></p>
<p>During a recent visit to a European country, I met a professor of medicine who, till recently, was the head of his department but was currently engaged in a research job. He explained that as a department head, he was spending a lot of his time on administration, which he did not relish. Hence he had jumped at this opportunity of a research professorship although it involved some loss of status. Such a case history would be difficult to find in India. I have been reflecting over the deeper reasons for, and the wider consequences of, this difference. The search for reasons has taken me to the earlier period of our lives, and that for the consequences seems to explain to a considerable degree our dismal performance as a nation in creative spheres – be they scientific, artistic or literary.</p>
<p>In India, a child is expected to like milk because children should take milk, and he should recite nursery rhymes to guests because all nice children do. At school, right from kindergarten through college, the tasks as well as goals are well defined. Someone else has determined for the student what he should learn and at what pace. The courses are so cramped that there is little time left for the learner to reflect on what he is doing, his inner urges, or his cherished goals and aspirations. There is no opportunity for the child to experiment with optional activities to discover what really interests him, absorbs him and moves him. The result is a routine jam-packed with tasks which have to be completed to please, or rather to avoid displeasing, teachers and parents. Since these tasks do not necessarily interest him, and since there is not too much time to spend on even those that do, everything is completed in a perfunctory manner without bothering about perfection. In such circumstances, getting passionately involved in any activity is a risky proposition since it would lead to the neglect of other ‘compulsory’ activities.</p>
<p>Not only is all available time filled with activities defined by somebody else, the goals of the individual are also determined by others. The school, home and society put together send enough direct and hidden signals to tell the person what is expected of him ‘in his own interest’. The expectations, at different stages, are to pass examinations with good marks, to get admitted to a professional course, to have a good job, a good income, and to lead a good life, which generally means a life full of all the ‘good things’.</p>
<p>Since these goals are everybody's goals, the most important goal is to beat others at reaching these goals. Thus competitiveness, including its most unhealthy and ugly forms, assumes far greater importance than achieving excellence for its own sake. Further, even a superficial look at the cherished goals of society reveals that irrespective of the stage of life, the common thread that unites them all is that they are all very concrete, objective and measurable. None of these is an intangible goal aimed at gratifying some deep-seated yearning of the soul. Consequently, we grow up without being aware that such yearnings can even exist, leave alone think of satisfying these or actually experiencing the immense and incomparable pleasure which results from their gratification.<a name="page275"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">275</span></span></p>
<p>Is it any wonder, then, that when a doctoral student joins an institution, and his prospective guide asks the routine question, “What are you interested in working on?”, the reply is, as a rule, most disturbing. The student may be frank enough to leave the subject of research to the guide, which indirectly means that he is not much interested in anything except the doctoral degree. Alternatively, he may give a perfunctory reply, but it is quite obvious that he is fumbling for words. He fails to hide the fact that all through his previous school and college life, there is nothing that has fascinated him, there has been no question which has disturbed him, and there has been no urge to create new knowledge which has moved him.</p>
<p>What, then, do we expect of this person when he has obtained his doctorate? He will try to get the most paying and most prestigious job, and his future goal will be to climb higher and higher in the hierarchy. When he becomes the head of a department, he would perhaps feel contented, or dream of becoming the head of the institution. It would be unthinkable for him, or for those around him, that he would give up the ‘headship’ to find more time to pursue his research interests. To him, research has only been a means to an end. How can he give up the end itself to mess with the means? The intoxicating effect of having participated in generation of new knowledge is foreign to him, as is the thrill that can come from the creation of a unique piece of art or literature. No, our head of the department will never do such a ‘silly’ thing as giving up the ‘headship’ to become a mere research worker or teacher. In short, through a prolonged pursuit of stereotype goals, we lose the opportunity to identify what we are really made for.</p>
<p>Life becomes for us a task to be completed according to cut and dried rules. There is no place for emotion, adventure and enthusiasm in such an existence. Does it mean then, that we have lost the capacity to feel strongly? That is also, unfortunately, far from true. As a society, we are very touchy about money, marriage and many minor matters. When it comes to religion, we are very fanatic about its ritualistic aspects, which are the least important, while we are quite willing to let the neglect of ethical aspects pass. In academic institutions, there is no lack of emotion when the discussion is about pay scales and promotions. In other words, our emotional palsy is restricted to the creative sphere.</p>
<p>The result is that although we produce a large volume of scientific, literary and artistic work, its overall quality leaves a lot to be desired. Its quality is not the very best because wholehearted, single-minded devotion has not gone into it. The creative activity has been a small part of the creator's life, not the strongest reason for his existence.</p>
<p>It would be less than fair to terminate this exercise in breast beating at this point without suggesting what we can do about it. The problem needs a radical cure, which means we have to begin at the beginning. We have to teach our children to be honest with themselves, and tell us what they really enjoy doing. They must identify what it is that absorbs them so much that they lose track of time and forget their food and play. They must know what they would like to go on doing for ever.</p>
<p>To make it possible for our children to know all this, three things are very important. Firstly, we should not coax them to achieve predetermined goals. It is not essential for every child to be ‘first’ in the class because it is not possible. It is undesirable for every adult to be a doctor or an engineer because a dedicated carpenter who is genuinely interested in his work makes a better contribution to society than an indifferent doctor or engineer. Secondly, if a child displays an intense interest in an unconventional activity such as music or drawing, it should be possible for him to spend plenty of time on it, and eventually make an honourable living out of it. And finally, it is most important that we leave our children enough time to discover themselves.</p>
<p>In kindergarten, there should be enough time for playing with sand and painting with fingers; in primary school, there should be enough time for plasticine; and in middle and secondary school, there should be enough time for drawing, music, acting, handicrafts, creative writing, amateur science, and almost everything, including nothing. Yes, time for doing nothing is also important. That is the time when we discover ourselves.<a name="page276"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">276</span></span></p>
<p>Neurophysiologists now believe that linear, logical and analytic thinking uses the left side of the brain, while the right side of the brain is involved in intuitive and reflective thinking. While activity of the left brain is important for the necessary background knowledge, creativity depends on leaving time for the right brain to wander apparently aimlessly. This type of approach would help our children grow into self-confident adults who know what they want. They would seek and find happiness in spheres which truly please them. They would also have the courage of conviction to renounce their ‘headship’ even if the whole world feels they have lost their head.</p>

</div><div class="section" id="ch19lev1sec3"><h1 class="title">EDUCATION, AS IT SHOULD BE</h1>
<p>Progress in science cannot be an isolated phenomenon. Therefore, general measures to improve our system of education are as relevant to scientific progress as to overall progress of the country.</p>
<p>One of the first aims of our education should be to uproot the negative self-image which we have as a legacy of the system of education imposed on us by the British. Our textbooks should familiarize the student with the past glory and innate genius of the nation, and contrast it with our present misery. For this, no empty rhetoric is required: there are enough facts from which the student can himself draw these conclusions. As a corollary, the idealism and courage of youth would get channelized towards the vital task of making India realise its potential.</p>
<p>Comprehensive guidelines for a system of national education were published by Sri Aurobindo and the Mother over a period of about 40 years (ca.1910-1950), and their success demonstrated at the International Centre of Education at Pondicherry. In some of his essays, Sri Aurobindo discussed the case for a universal (read western) system of education and demolished it with dispassionate but deeply convincing arguments. Next, he discussed what the guiding principles of the national system should be. He wrote that our system should be “an education proper to the Indian soul and need and temperament and culture that we are in quest of, not indeed something faithful merely to the past, but to the developing soul of India, to her future need, to the greatness of her coming self-creation, to her eternal spirit. …… the scientific, rationalistic, industrial, pseudo-democratic civilization of the West is now in the process of dissolution and it would be a lunatic absurdity for us at this moment to build blindly on that sinking foundation. When the most advanced minds of the occident are beginning to turn in this red evening of the West for the hope of a new and more spiritual civilization to the genius of Asia, it would be strange if we could think of nothing better than to cast <a name="page277"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">277</span></span>away our own self and potentialities and put our trust in the dissolving and moribund past of Europe… within the universal mind and soul of humanity is the mind and soul of the individual with its infinite variation, its commonness and its uniqueness, and between them there stands an intermediate power, the mind of a nation, the soul of a people. And of all these three education must take account if it is to be, not a machine-made fabric, but a true building or a living evocation of the process of the mind and spirit of the human being.”</p>
<p>Not only did Sri Aurobindo and the Mother emphasize that our system of education should be true to the genius of India but also that it should take into account the totality of the individual. The totality of the individual is constituted by his body, mind, intellect and his Divine essence, often called the soul. A good system of education should strengthen, sharpen and refine the body, mind and intellect, and also help the child become aware of his Divine essence and the positive role it can play in daily life. Such education may be called integral (total) because it educates the whole being. In contrast, education today neglects the body and mind (emotions), and rejects the soul; it is essentially all mental education. What makes matters worse is that we do a very poor job of even mental education.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch19lev2sec4"><h2 class="title">Mental Education</h2>
<p>Although all components of integral education are as relevant to science education as they are to education in any other field, let us assume for simplicity that it is only the mental education component that is most intimately related to the quality of science education. It is a well-worn cliché in education that it is more important for the student to know how to learn than to learn (you give a man a fish, and you feed him for a day; you teach a man how to fish, and you feed him for life, etc. etc.). But what happens in practice is that the emphasis is on learning facts, and the examinations are centred around factual recall. For the tools that the student may choose for learning the facts, the student is left to his own devices. Leave aside sharpening the tools of learning, the student is not even told what the best tools are.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch19lev3sec1"><h3 class="title">Mental Education, as it Should be</h3>
<p>Much of our knowledge about the world is based on sensory perception – present and past. Therefore one of the first tasks in mental education should be to enhance the accuracy and sensitivity of sensory perception. Memory is also important for learning. Memory is <a name="page278"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">278</span></span>essentially a function of attention and concentration. A child pays attention to what he is interested in. Therefore, it is important to, one, make interesting what is essential for every child to learn; two, find out what is interesting to an individual child; and finally, create opportunities for each individual child to discover what he is most interested in. Concentration is essentially a process of focussing on what is important, and neglecting what is unimportant. By doing so, all the energies get directed to the desirable goal. Therefore, for mental concentration, the ability to control thoughts is important. This is not easy because the mind, by its very nature, is turbulent. That is why we have myriad thoughts criss-crossing the mind at any point in time. During meditation, mental silence is achieved by using strategies which reduce the genesis of thoughts, and also facilitate ignoring or rejecting thoughts. Therefore meditative techniques have great relevance to developing the power of concentration.</p>
<p>Memory is important but not creative. For creative use of the intellect, we need the faculties of organisation of ideas, analysis, comparison, differentiation, expression – spoken and written, and last but not least, reasoning. Further, as the Mother has said, the child should develop the capacities of expansion, wideness, complexity and richness, and also enhance his receptivity to inspirations coming from the higher regions of the being. Regarding the last, this is an ability which is not only neglected, but even deliberately suppressed in formal education. Intuition is considered not only unreliable and inferior as compared to sensory perception and logic, but even ridiculed. The result is that the child tends to hide any such insights. On the other hand, we know that several problems in research have been conceived or solved by intuitive flashes of insight, interpretation of all research needs a few intuitive leaps, and pathbreaking revolutionary research always deviates from the formal route of processing facts statistically and logically.</p>
<p>Returning to logic, our training is so poor that it is not at all surprising that our thinking, in general, remains sloppy in spite of being highly educated. The basic principles of logic, according to Sri Aurobindo, are that the starting facts should be correct and complete, and after a plausible conclusion has been deduced logically from the facts, other possible or impossible conclusions from the same facts should be eliminated. For example, based on the observation that if an animal bleeds beyond a point, it dies, one may logically conclude that the seat of life is blood. This is obviously wrong because although the observation as well as reasoning are correct, the facts available <a name="page279"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">279</span></span>are <span class="italic">not complete.</span> An animal also dies if its heart stop beating, or if it stops breathing, or if it is brain-dead. There need be no blood loss in any of these situations. How can all this be taught to a child, and how early can it be taught? Sri Aurobindo makes the important point that logic itself should not be taught as a subject of study. One should proceed from examples to a spontaneous appreciation of the rules of logic. Given below are two examples which may be used in schools for study of logic – the first one of them being suitable even for very small children.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Present the children a situation in which ‘a child said that he did not like cabbage. When asked why, he said that he did not like its looks’. Help the children deduce that the conclusion about the taste of cabbage has been drawn from its looks, which is inappropriate (not only the facts available here are incomplete, the relevant facts are not available). The discussion may continue. Suppose the child agrees to taste it, and still finds it unpalatable. Does this single observation indicate a consistent relationship between appearance of a food and its taste? Could the child's conclusions be wrong because he was already prejudiced against the cabbage?</p></li>
<li><p>Present the children the following situation. ‘A went to B's house. He found the door locked. He returned and said that B was not at home. The discussion of this simple, and apparently correct application of logic can bring out some basis rules of logic.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Are the facts correct? If the observation was not carefully made, it is possible that the lock was behind the latch, not in front of it.</p></li>
<li><p>Are the facts complete? Did the house have only one door? It is impossible that another entrance to the house was not locked.</p></li>
<li><p>Could the conclusion be prejudiced? It is possible that A did not want to see B. He might have gone there expecting that B would not be home. Therefore, it is possible that the slightest hint of a locked house relieved A and he hastily concluded that B was not home. Is it possible that the expectation with which he went to B's home prejudiced not only A's application of logic but even the observation that the door was locked?</p></li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<p>As Sri Aurobindo says, through examples “the mind can be trained to reason as correctly as the fallibility of human logic will allow, minimizing the chances of error. The study of formal logic should be postponed to a later time when it can easily be mastered in a very brief period, since it will be only the systematising of an art perfectly well known to the student.”<a name="page280"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">280</span></span></p>

</div><div class="section" id="ch19lev1sec4"><h1 class="title">WHAT CAN WE DO RIGHT NOW?</h1>
<p>A thorough overhaul of the system of education is necessary not only for better Indian science but also for overall progress of the country and for individual fulfillment. But even if education were to be reformed today, its impact on scientific research will be perceptible only half a century later. Is there something we can do which will improve our visibility in the world of science within ten years? There are three measures which could help in this respect.</p>
<p>First, the quality of our scientists is more important for a good image of Indian science than their quantity. Therefore, only those who are really interested in science and have an aptitude for it should go in for science. To some extent, this has already started happening because management and several other non-science jobs are today more popular than scientific research.</p>
<p>Secondly, those who are really fit for science should be able to go in for science. For this, our entrance exams need reforms. In these exams, the ability to think clearly and logically should carry much more weightage than factual recall.</p>
<p>Last but not least, we should draw inspiration for the problems we choose to work on from our own environment and culture. The significance of this point is best illustrated through an example. The renowned Indian physiologist, Prof. B.K. Anand, discovered the hunger centre in the hypothalamus in 1951 and continued to work on neural regulation of food intake for about 25 years after that. He also did a few pioneering studies on yoga for about 5 years, most of which were published in 1961. If one looks up the chapter on food intake in a textbook of physiology or nutrition, or a monograph or review on food intake, there is only a 50-50 chance that Prof. Anand's work has been cited. What it means is that in spite of his discovery and subsequent work being significant, many authors are able to give a seemingly complete and comprehensive account of the physiology of food intake without citing Prof. Anand's work. On the other hand, no respectable chapter or review on the scientific aspects of yoga can be complete without citing at least one or two of the 1961 publications of Prof. Anand. A Google search in Feb. 2007 under ‘B.K. Anand and Food intake’ yielded 28,300 hits; a search on the same day under ‘B.K. Anand and Yoga’ yielded 23,500 hits. The visibility of work inspired by our own unique heritage needs no further comment.</p>
</div><div class="section" id="ch19lev1sec5"><h1 class="title">PREDICTING THE FUTURE</h1>
<p>The journey of modern science began with the European renaissance. The renaissance generated the scientific spirit first, next came science, <a name="page281"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">281</span></span>and technology came last. While Europe was performing this journey, we were grappling with foreign invasions and foreign rules. After independence, expediency compelled us to borrow technology first, we tried to develop our science next, and are now waiting for the scientific spirit to arrive (Bhide 2000). Many of us wonder whether this journey can really be performed successfully in the reverse direction.</p>
<p>However, the outlook might change if we look further back in history. The European renaissance was preceded by the scholastic age in the 13th Century. Further, European science could not have taken off without the foundations laid by the Indians, Greeks and Romans in 500 B.C. – 200 A.D. (the Golden Age), which were preserved by the Arabs in the form of translations. Going still further back, the achievements of the Golden Age might not have been possible without the foundations laid by the ancient civilizations (c. 3000 B.C.) of India, China and Egypt. What makes these events appear independent is long gaps separating them (<a href="#ch19fig1" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 19.1</a>). The gaps are periods of political instability, religious intolerance, feudalism, obscurantism and the like, but with the return of more favourable circumstances, the human spirit has repeatedly bounced back, and science has taken off from the point where the previous enlightened period had left it. Therefore, the perception that the modern miracles of technology are the culmination of a chain of events that began with the European renaissance can only be maintained by refusing to look back far enough. It ignores the achievements of the Indus valley civilization in mathematics, astronomy and city planning, the achievements of Chinese medicine and the architectural marvels of Rome, the remains of which survive to this day. There was sufficient communication even in the distant past to ensure continuity in successive periods of enlightenment across long distances. Finally, a little introspection would reveal that the development of science and technology is a bit like the chicken and egg story, it is difficult to say which came first. The first concern of man is to achieve physical comfort, which needs technology.</p>
<div class="figure" id="ch19fig1" data-label="Fig. 19.1"><div class="title"><span class="item-label">Fig. 19.1</span> Long gaps between spurts of activity. An interesting conclusion which may be drawn from the long gaps is that peak achievement is possible only when everything is right, and everything is right only occasionally and briefly in a small part of the world</div><img alt="Figure 281-1" src="XML/9788184484175/Chapters/images/281-1.jpg"><div class="additional-markup"></div></div>
<p><a name="page282"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">282</span></span>The primitive man who observed that by rubbing two stones one can generate fire no doubt had a scientific temper, but he must have looked at fire primarily as a potential tool for cooking rather than as a physical phenomenon worthy of detached scientific study. The same would apply to the man who translated the sight of a rolling log of wood into the invention of the wheel. These technological developments would have made life somewhat comfortable for man, and ensured the basic necessities with very much reduced effort, generating thereby mental peace and leisure. Only after that could luxuries like literature, music and art have found a place on the human agenda. These intellectual luxuries have a tendency to boost our innate scientific temper, which in turn leads to development of science.<sup><a href="#ch19fn8" class="ulink-inter">8</a></sup> Science leads to technology, which generates still more leisure, and so on. Thus the course of civilizations has a circular rather than a linear configuration (<a href="#ch19fig2" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 19.2</a>). This circular model give us a historical basis for optimism because we can start at any point in the cycle and hope to progress further.</p>

<p><a name="page283"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">283</span></span>Rays of hope consistent with the circular model have already started illuminating the horizon in India. With pragmatic considerations in view, immediately after independence we invested in a strong industrial and technological base, much of which had to be transported from the West and transplanted in the Indian soil which did not seem ready for it. We followed it up with a geometric expansion of science education and the establishment of institutions for advanced scientific research. This enormous effort has, so far, generated quantity rather than quality. In spite of India having the dubious distinction of having one-third of the scientific manpower of the world, her impact on science has been negligible. However, the efforts made since independence have not been a waste. We have given way to a generation that is inquisitive, creative, articulate, and has a sense of national pride. We have the likes of Vikram Seth, Deepak Chopra, Amartya Sen, Arundhati Roy, Amjad Ali Khan, Mira Nair, Leander Paes and Sachin Tendulkar, to name just a few, to boast of. We have a huge middle class whose basic needs have been satisfied and who have the leisure to take interest in finer aspects of life. The world is suddenly interested in our culture, and has started looking up to us for our spiritual heritage. In short, India now counts. Haven't we unwittingly moved part of the circle (<a href="#ch19fig3" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 19.3</a>) and aren't we poised for a leap to the next stage, i.e. flowering of the scientific attitude?</p>
<div class="figure" id="ch19fig3" data-label="Fig. 19.3"><div class="title"><span class="item-label">Fig. 19.3</span> We seem to have traveled one half of the circle depicted in <a href="#ch19fig2" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 19.2B</a> in the last 60 years</div><img alt="Figure 283-1" src="XML/9788184484175/Chapters/images/283-1.jpg"><div class="additional-markup"></div></div>
<p><a name="page284"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">284</span></span>In short, there is no inherent reason why India cannot contribute to science. The phase of decline of the Indian civilization is over. There are several pointers suggesting that in the cycle of scientific development (<a href="#ch19fig2" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 19.2</a>), we are at a very favourable point for take-off. Our leaders, Nehru onwards, have shown a deep commitment to science. As a society, we are developing a sense of national pride. During the last couple of decades we have seen a remarkable surge of indigenous literature and arts, somewhat comparable to that seen in thirteenth century Europe. We have an active educational and cultural exchange with the West, and we are not restricted by any orthodoxy which may prevent us from absorbing the best features of the outside world. We are the repository of timeless wisdom, which includes novel instruments for arriving at the truth. If only we can capitalize on our strengths while being aware of our weaknesses, we can safely predict a very bright future for Indian science.<sup><a href="#ch19fn9" class="ulink-inter">9</a></sup></p>
</div><div class="section" id="ch19lev1sec6"><h1 class="title">CLOSING THOUGHTS</h1>
<p>While there is ample basis to believe that India has the potential to excel in scientific research, there are two qualifications which need to be considered. First, to realize the potential, wishful thinking will not do. We need to work on our weaknesses, the most glaring one being our outmoded system of education, which systematically kills the scientific temper with which we are born instead of nurturing and disciplining it. Secondly, India has excelled in the past in Astronomy and Mathematics, which do not require lab experiments, and in Medicine, which seems to have developed primarily through a combination of intuition and empirical observation. Today Indians have made a mark in computer science, which also depends primarily on imagination, intuition and mental effort rather than experiments requiring a combination of head and hands. These facts point to certain selected areas of science for which the Indian scientists seem to be specially suited. The significance of seeking inspiration locally for topics of research has already been emphasized. In short, India may not do equally well in all sciences. But that is not a problem – we can select areas for which we have special talent. No country in the world has to contribute to every area of science. Some countries need not contribute to any area of science, but India is too great a nation to be one of them.</p>
