For some of them it is their first experience with public speaking. Hence some guidance might be useful in making a better presentation.</p><div class="section" id="ch15lev1sec1"><h1 class="title">SENDING THE ABSTRACT</h1>
<p>The preparation for attending a conference usually begins with sending an abstract. Apart from following meticulously the instructions of the organizers regarding the format and word-limit, the contents are also important. As discussed in greater detail in <a href="/9788184484175/chapter/ch13" class="ulink-exter">Chapters 13</a> and <a href="/9788184484175/chapter/ch14" class="ulink-exter">14</a>, an abstract summarizes the rationale, methods, results and conclusions of the study. The ‘Methods’ should give the experimental design, sample size, characteristics of the sample, and outcome measures briefly, but should not give the techniques used for making the measurements or the statistical tools used for data analysis. The ‘Results’ should include salient observations, including the most important quantitative information.</p>
<p>Abstracts sent to conferences are generally accepted uncritically. But that is not reason enough for not taking adequate care while writing them. However, that is the reason why an abstract published in the proceedings of a conference is looked upon as a less reliable source of information as compared to a research paper in a peer-reviewed journal.<a name="page220"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">220</span></span></p>
</div><div class="section" id="ch15lev1sec2"><h1 class="title">MAKING SLIDES OR TRANSPARENCIES</h1>
<p>The next step after sending the abstract is to prepare material for illustrating the talk. The conventional 2”× 2” slides have become more or less obsolete now. Although most conferences have facilities for overhead projection also, it is much better to make PowerPoint slides.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch15lev2sec1"><h2 class="title">PowerPoint Slides</h2>
<p>The two most important requirements of a visual aid are that it should be legible and it should be easy to grasp. A slide is on the screen for hardly a minute, and during that period the audience has to both listen and see. Therefore a cramped slide is completely useless. By the same token, the number of slides should be limited. The slides serve no purpose, even if they are otherwise excellent, if they make only a fleeting appearance on the screen because the speaker is in a hurry. As a rule of the thumb, the number of slides should not exceed the number of minutes available for the presentation. In a 10-minute presentation, 2-3 minutes are usually for discussion. Hence the slides should be limited to 7 or 8, which may be split into Introduction (1), Methods (1 or 2), Results (2 or 3), and Conclusions (1 or 2) slides.</p>
<p>The slides may consist of text, data, drawings, or pictures, such as clinical photographs, pathological specimens, operative procedures or micrographs. The following guidelines apply mainly to text and data slides: it is difficult to formulate general guidelines for drawings and pictures.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch15lev3sec1"><h3 class="title">The Template</h3>
<p>PowerPoint provides a bewildering variety of backgrounds, colours and fonts. Choose a simple <span class="italic">background,</span> although many complicated ones are available. If the background is complicated and attractive, the audience looks at the background rather than the message. In technical language, an elaborate background increases the noise/signal ratio. My favourite is either a plain or a mildly textured background. The <span class="italic">colours</span> of the background and lettering should be contrasting. This may be achieved by having a light background and dark lettering, or the other way round. Of the two, a light background with dark lettering is better for a variety of reasons. First, it is, on the whole, easier to read. Second, it does not make the room very dark even if the lights have been switched off. Some brightness in the room keeps the speaker visible and the audience awake, and also makes things <a name="page221"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">221</span></span>easier for those who want to take notes. However, a white background is not the best because it can dazzle the eyes in a dark room: a light colour is therefore the ideal choice. My favourites are a light blue background with maroon lettering. Regarding the choice of <span class="italic">font,</span> the ligibility of Times New Roman is not good in slides. The best fonts for slides are Arial and its close cousins, such as Arial Narrow and Arial Black. My favourites are Arial Black for the title of the slide, and Arial (Bold) for the headings and text. The font size of the headings should be slightly larger than that of the text. Arial Narrow (Bold) may be used if more letters have to be accommodated in a single line. If you have a colourful personality, different colours may be chosen for the title and the rest of the material. My favourite for that purpose is deep green for the title and maroon for the rest of the material.</p>
<p>Avoid risky combinations such as yellow lettering on light blue background. Combinations which look beautiful on the computer screen may become hopeless on the big screen because the colours often get modified by projection, and the long distance between the screen and the viewer may also reduce legibility in spite of the magnification.</p>
<p>Once a template has been designed, it should be used for all the slides unless there is a special reason for deviating. A uniform pattern facilitates comprehension because after the first few slides the audience gets used to the format and grasps the information faster.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch15lev3sec2"><h3 class="title">Text</h3>
<p>The slide should not be cramped with the text. As a rule of the thumb, a slide should have no more than 7 lines. Further, the font size should be such that the slide looks aesthetically good and is also legible. As a rough guide, font size 36 for the title, 32 for headings, and 28 for the text is appropriate. If one resolves to never go below font size 20 in a slide, one can ensure legibility. But 20 is the outer limit – as far as possible, one should not go below font size 24. If the matter is excessive, either it should be pruned, or the slide split into two slides.</p>
<p>The material on the slide should be in the form of bulleted clauses rather than full sentences. One thing which should never be done is to write the entire presentation on slides. Reading out from slides does not make it any better than reading out from sheets of paper. The slides should carry only the main points. It is the job of the speaker to elaborate upon them orally during the talk.<a name="page222"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">222</span></span></p>
<p>The text on slides should not be in ‘all capitals’. Contrary to what some people think, that actually reduces legibility because we are not accustomed to reading material which is all in capitals. It might have some justification in overhead projection if the handwriting of the speaker is poor. But when the facility of PowerPoint slides is available, making the audience read ‘ALL CAPS’ is a pain.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch15lev3sec3"><h3 class="title">Data</h3>
<p>As a principle, data in a publication should preferably be tabulated, but in slides it should be in the form of diagrams. The reasons are simple: the time available for reading a publication is unlimited, whereas that for looking at a slide is generally less than a minute. Secondly, the reader of a publication may be interested in detailed results, but the viewer of a slide has to feel contented with trends: if he needs details, he can ask the speaker for a reprint of the work. It takes a little time and work, but all tables with data should be converted into diagrams (<a href="#ch15tbl1" class="ulink-inter">Table 15.1</a>).</p>
<div class="table" id="ch15tbl1"><div class="title"><span class="item-label">Table 15.1</span> Diagrams most appropriate for different types of data</div><div class="table-scroll"><table data-label="Table 15.1" class="download">

</table></div><div class="additional-markup"></div></div>
<p>However, if a Table is unavoidable in a slide, as a rule of the thumb, the number of columns should be less than four, and that of rows, less than seven. An extensive Table projected as a slide creates a ‘Railway Timetable’ effect, and the audience gets nothing from it. If a big Table is absolutely essential, it should be split into a number of smaller Tables.</p>
<p>The above guidelines are often ignored, sometimes even by those who know them. The commonest mistakes are to show too many slides, show them too quickly, and to have too much material on each slide. I have seen some very senior people commit even bigger mistakes, like using colour combinations which make the slide illegible, or writing out the text of their talk on slides. The audience, out of courtesy, lets them get away with it, but the performance does not exactly cover them with glory. In a nutshell, the speaker should put himself in the shoes of the audience, and make sure that the visual aid does not become a visual hindrance.<a name="page223"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">223</span></span></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch15lev2sec2"><h2 class="title">Transparencies</h2>
<p>Unless the organizers of the conference have refused to make a data projector available, which would be rare today, using an overhead projector (OHP) should be considered a sign of laziness, poor planning, or both. However, assuming that sometimes using an OHP may be necessary, a few guidelines for preparing transparencies are given below:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Choose black, blue and purple pens for most of the work. The red pen may be used for highlighting a point. Yellow and orange should not be used because they hardly show when projected. However, yellow or orange may be used for numbering the transparencies because that is only for the speaker's consumption.</p></li>
<li><p>For legibility to be good, as a rule of the thumb, the letters should be at least 5 mm tall. A good scheme is to have capitals 1 cm tall and small letters 5 mm tall. A very easy way to achieve this, as well as uniformity and proper alignment of lines is to keep a graph paper under the transparency while writing. If the transparency is prepared from printed or typed matter by photocopying, the matter should be suitably enlarged to achieve letters of the right size.</p></li>
<li><p>As a rule of the thumb, one transparency should have no more than 10 lines.</p></li>
<li><p>Other principles, discussed while talking about slides, such as writing only bulleted clauses, not using ‘ALL CAPS’, and using diagrams instead of Tables, apply also to OHP transparencies.</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
</div><div class="section" id="ch15lev1sec3"><h1 class="title">SPEAKING</h1>
<p>The first principle of public speaking is that you should know the subject well. Knowing the subject well means that you should know much more than you have to speak. Having said that, it may be emphasized that following the first principle is not enough: the second, third and other principles are also important. The reason is that public speaking is more than a test of your knowledge – <span class="italic">it is a performance.</span> Like all performances, it needs advance preparation. For a beginner, the preparation can stretch to weeks before a 10-minute presentation. If you have both experience and talent, a few minutes of thought just before a 60-minute talk may suffice as preparation: but preparation is still required.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch15lev2sec3"><h2 class="title">The Preparation</h2>
<p>Since the abstract, and in some cases even the ‘full paper’ has already been written before the conference, the speaker already knows <span class="italic">what</span> <a name="page224"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">224</span></span>to speak. Therefore, the preparation consists of determining <span class="italic">how</span> to speak. Both are equally important, and in fact, the time required to prepare for the ‘how’ is much more than that for the ‘what’. The reason is that the contents, sequence and style of the spoken version have to be quite different from that of the written version in order to be effective. For example, the contents in the spoken style may include a joke to make the presentation interesting. Further, in the spoken version, the discussion may not be delayed till all of the results have been presented. It makes more sense to present results in parts, and discuss each part of the results as and when the results are presented. Only the results may be on a slide, and while a slide is on, the results which it is showing are best discussed there and then. The style of a good spoken presentation is typically the narrative style, and the sentences shorter than in the written version. Finally, the presentation has to be confined to the time limit. Therefore, preparation for the oral presentation should include a good deal of thought to the way facts will be presented, and plenty of rehearsals. The rehearsals should begin well before the conference to allow cooling off periods between rehearsals. During these periods, the material keeps roving in the mind, and as a result, newer and better ways of saying the same thing would occur to you. Note down these new ideas on a piece of paper, and use the ideas in the next rehearsal. Regarding time, be very strict with yourself. There is always something redundant that can be eliminated, always something that can be said in fewer words. Make sure that your final rehearsal is one minute less than the time allowed. You may need that extra minute for unforeseen events during the actual presentation.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch15lev2sec4"><h2 class="title">Just Before the Presentation</h2>
<p>Make sure that you have seen the hall in which you have to speak well before the presentation. Use the time early in the morning (before the sessions begin) or during the tea break to become familiar with the lectern, its electrical switches (if any), the microphone, the arrangement for projection, etc. It is highly desirable to hand over the CD carrying the PowerPoint presentation to the organizers well before the talk so that it can be tested and the material moved to the desktop of the computer to be used for projection. If circumstances permit, it is further desirable to have at least the first few slides projected on to the screen beforehand to test the system, and also to see how the slides look after magnification.<a name="page225"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">225</span></span></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch15lev2sec5"><h2 class="title">The Performance</h2>
<p>When the great moment finally arrives and your name is announced by the chairman, walk up to the podium with conscious and confident steps – neither too slow nor too fast – making sure that you do not stumble on a step or a loose wire. Take your place near the lectern. If it is too tall for you, stand on its side rather than behind it because the speaker should not only be heard but also seen. Establish eye contact with the chairperson and the audience. If you get nervous on seeing so many people looking at you, take heart: it happens to almost everybody. If you believe in starting every new activity with a prayer, say one silently – it takes only a moment. The prayer should not be for a brilliant performance, a performance which so impresses your seniors in the audience that they offer you a job. The prayer should be, and you should mean it, that you get the strength and ability to speak in such a way that so many people who have assembled to listen to you gain something from what you say.</p>
<p>If your command over the language of delivery is reasonably good, you need not take out any papers from a file or your pocket: the slides are more than enough as prompters. However, do keep at least an outline of the talk in your pocket just in case the electricity fails, and you have to speak without slides. As far as possible, do not read out from a written speech. However, if your poor knowledge of the language makes it essential to read out your talk, do not use the abstract or a published paper as your script. Prepare a write-up specifically for oral presentation. Further, you may include in this write up a print-out of all your slides, and write down separately what you will say about each slide. That will spare you the inconvenience of looking sometimes at the paper and sometimes at the screen. However, do look at the screen for a split second at every change of slide to make sure you are speaking about the slide on the screen, not the one before or after it. Finally, do not forget to look at the audience periodically, even if you are reading out the paper.</p>
<p>In the actual delivery, there are three points of primary importance: be loud, clear and slow (LCS). To start with, address the chairpersons and the audience. In a long talk, it is desirable to speak at least a few sentences before showing the first slide, but in a 7-8 minute presentation that is not essential. In a short presentation, after addressing the chairpersons and the audience, you may ask for the first slide.</p>
<p>Use the slides primarily as prompters. Expand each point on the slide appropriately in conversational style.<a name="page226"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">226</span></span></p>
<div class="figure" id="ch15fig1" data-label="Fig. 15.1"><div class="title"><span class="item-label">Fig. 15.1</span> Using the pointer in such a way that the speaker does not block the screen. Further, if the tip of the pointer is in contact with the screen, the tip and its shadow coincide with each other</div><img alt="Figure 226-1" src="XML/9788184484175/Chapters/images/226-1.jpg"><div class="additional-markup"></div></div>
<p>Spend enough time on each slide for the audience to grasp the slide and also listen to you. A good slide does not need to much to be ‘pointed out’, but it is good to keep a pointer handy and to use it when necessary. If you are using the good old stick-like pointer, you will have to move close to the screen. Stand on one side of the screen so that you do not cover it (if you are right handed, move to the right side of the screen, <a href="#ch15fig1" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 15.1</a>). The end of the pointer should touch the screen so that the audience is not confused whether you are pointing with the pointer or its shadow. However, touch the screen only lightly – do not strike it with the pointer so hard as to damage the screen. If you are using a laser pointer, switch it on only when necessary and use it in a disciplined manner only to point out something on the screen. Sometimes speakers get so absent-minded that they keep the pointer on long past its utility, and the red point flits all over the walls and ceiling like a firefly.</p>
<p>At the end of the presentation, if there is still some time left, the chairperson might invite the audience to ask questions. Listen to the question carefully, do not interrupt the questioner unless absolutely essential – and even then, politely. Respond briefly: a question is not an invitation for a second lecture. If the question needs a long answer, say a relevant sentence or two, and then request the person to talk to you individually after the session. Some interventions by the audience are not really questions but comments. It is polite to respond even to comments, but the response should be extremely brief: only the <a name="page227"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">227</span></span>questions call for a little longer response. Make sure to appreciate a good question or comment, but do not criticize the bad ones. Leave all the dirty work of interrupting, criticizing, and not allowing questions after the time is over to the chairpersons. You have to cooperate only by keeping your answers brief, and by not answering questions after the chairperson has declared that no more questions would be allowed.</p>
<p>Finally, a few minor points of some importance. Avoid mannerisms such as repeated stereotype movements with the hands, pacing to and fro across the stage, or frequent use of expressions like ‘you see’. Do not keep the hands in the pockets: it is considered impolite. Your dress should be decent – neither too shabby nor too elegant. If the dress is very attractive, the audience may look at you more than they listen to you.</p>
<p>When it is all over, say thank you, and retain your presence of mind as you walk down the podium: do not start walking away with the collar mike. If you started with a prayer, do not forget to say one also at the end.</p>
</div>
</div><div class="section" id="ch15lev1sec4"><h1 class="title">POSTER PRESENTATION</h1>
<p>Posters are an ingenious way of providing a virtually unlimited number of young investigators an opportunity to present their work at a scientific conference. Although the time allotted to poster presentations is very little, the interaction possible is much more than in oral presentations. Posters also spare more time for invited lectures and symposia which enable all the delegates to benefit from the wisdom of eminent scientists attending the conference.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch15lev2sec6"><h2 class="title">Making Posters</h2>
<p>Using computer technology, very elegant posters can be made with relatively less effort. Although special printers are available for making the poster on a single large sheet, there are many advantages in organizing the material on A4 sheets. First, the organizational effort required is less. Secondly, A4 sheets allow greater flexibility in the way the posters are displayed during the conference. Finally, A4 sheets are easier to carry during the journey.</p>
<p>First of all, find out the surface area available for the poster. If the area is rectangular, try to find whether the poster will be displayed in the landscape style or portrait style (<a href="#ch15fig2" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 15.2</a>). This is particularly important if you are thinking of making the poster on large sheets. Based on that, determine how many large or A4 sheets will fit into the area.<a name="page228"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">228</span></span></p>
<div class="figure" id="ch15fig2" data-label="Fig. 15.2"><div class="title"><span class="item-label">Fig. 15.2</span> The landscape and portrait styles of setting up a rectangular board</div><img alt="Figure 228-1" src="XML/9788184484175/Chapters/images/228-1.jpg"><div class="additional-markup"></div></div>
<p>The next step is to draft the material. Besides the title, authors and the place of work, arrange the material under titles such as Introduction, Aims, Methods, Results and Conclusions. You may also add a few references, if necessary; the reference to the work of the poster if it has been published, and the references to related work which might have been published by the same laboratory. The general principles for designing posters are similar to those for slides. The material should be legible from a distance of about 2 metres even to a person whose vision is not perfect. The layout should not be cramped: some empty spaces left in an artistic manner add to the beauty of the poster. The Results should be in the form of readily assimilable diagrams. The versatility available in the colours of the paper and type faces should be used effectively to enhance legibility as well as the aesthetic appeal. Near the title, one may add frills such as the photograph of the person who will be presenting the work, and that of the institution where the work was done. Some photographs of <a name="page229"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">229</span></span>equipment, procedures, X-rays, patients, etc. may also be added at appropriate places. Some relevant objects may also be made a part of the poster display. For example, in a poster presentation on the metabolic effects of buckwheat, I had put some buckwheat in a small transparent plastic bag and pinned it on the poster so that people could see what buckwheat looks like. Further, one may place near the poster a handout on the abstract of the work, or reprints of the work reported in the poster, or related work.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch15lev2sec7"><h2 class="title">Carrying the Poster</h2>
<p>Large sheets should be carried in a stiff cylindrical box (like the ones in which badminton shuttle cocks are packed). A4 sheets may be enclosed in an envelope in the company of a stiff card so that they do not get crumpled, and carried in a brief case. Along with the poster material, carry also the hundouts, reprints, photographs, etc. required for the display. If you are very cautious and meticulous, you may also take some sticking tape, scissors and drawing pins.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch15lev2sec8"><h2 class="title">The Presentation</h2>
<p>Set up your display well in time for the presentation. Put on your best smile, and make yourself available near the poster throughout the period allotted for the presentation. Be prepared for several rounds of brief one-minute presentations on your work. You can also expect a fruitful formal interaction after the poster presentation if it has been arranged by the organizers, or at least an informal interaction during tea break.</p>
</div>
</div><div class="section" id="ch15lev1sec5"><h1 class="title">CLOSING THOUGHTS</h1>
<p>Presenting work at conferences is a great experience, both professionally and socially. It provides an opportunity to get feedback from a diverse group of scientists – some working in almost exactly the same area, and some completely unfamiliar with the field of your research. The responses of both groups are equally important in improving the quality of work, looking at the work from various angles, and generating new ideas for future work. The social interactions during tea breaks, dinners and sight-seeing, at airports and railway stations, and on trains and planes may lead to lasting friendships. Our soul-mates often exist in distant lands, and conferences help in bringing us in contact with them.</p>
