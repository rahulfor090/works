The topics under its umbrella cover an extremely wide range. On one hand is the study of normal human behaviour of different age groups, in various settings, under a variety of circumstances, in contrasting cultures. Then there is research on the etiology, course, outcome and treatment of various psychiatric disorders. The study of specific problems such as alcoholism, addiction, violence, crime and post-traumatic stress disorder is also a part of mental health. The studies may be on special populations such as students, couples in trouble, executives, prisoners or mentally retarded children, or the people in close contact with these populations. Finally, the research may be interdisciplinary, involving collaboration with departments such as neurology, neurophysiology, pediatrics, oncology or community medicine. The setting of research may be a hospital, laboratory, school, prison, factory or the community. Thus, the range of studies possible in mental health is virtually limitless.</p><p class="indent">Clinical trials, which have already been discussed in <a href="/9788184484175/chapter/ch6" class="ulink-exter">Chapter 6</a>, may acquire special difficulties in mental health research. Depending on their personality, the subjects may decide to give responses that would support the investigator's hypothesis (‘good’ subjects) or refute the hypothesis (‘negativistic’ subjects). Alternatively, the subjects may act in a manner that would enhance their social image. Similarly, the characteristics of the investigator could also influence the outcome of the study. Further, the intervention is rarely simple (e.g. an antidepressant drug). More often than not, it is a mixture of various components. Accordingly, the question may be whether the whole package is effective; which component of the package is effective; whether adding a new component to a conventional package is effective; whether changing some characteristic such as duration of treatment, number and frequency of sessions, etc. is effective; and <a name="page111"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">111</span></span>how some characteristics of the patient, therapist, or the system of transaction between the patient and the therapist affect the course of the disease. Finally, the evaluation of the intervention may be not only in terms of the improvement in symptoms, but also in terms of duration, cost and acceptability.</p><p class="indent">Because of many of these complicating factors, mental health research has depended, particularly in the past, on case studies rather than large scale randomized clinical trials. Therefore, some nuances of single-case research will be discussed here, although such studies are by no means restricted to mental health.</p><div class="section" id="ch8lev1sec1"><h1 class="title">CASE STUDIES</h1>
<p class="noindent">There is a wide spectrum of case studies which, for convenience, may be divided into three categories. First, non-formal case studies which are narratives of clinical observations without any particular efforts to make it a piece of research; second, case studies which have followed a rigorous research design; and third, case studies which fall between these two extremes, which may be described as quasi-experimental.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch8lev2sec1"><h2 class="title">Non-formal Case Studies</h2>
<p class="noindent">These are accounts of interesting cases based on carefully recorded and preserved clinical observations. In spite of their anecdotal nature, lack of quantitative data, and absence of controls, they have played an important role in clinical medicine, specially in psychiatry. The present system of psychiatric diagnosis is based largely on thousands of case studies assiduously collected and classified by Kraeplin.</p>
<p class="indent">The major limitations of non-formal case studies is that they are a mixture of the subjective impressions of the patient (or informants) and the therapist. There is no way to prove or refute a hypothesis about the causal relationships between past events and the present state of the patient. The patient's recollections of the past are partial and selective, and the therapist's theorizing is based on subjective interpretation of the available data. That is the reason why in spite of the case study being logical and well-argued, its generalizability is poor.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch8lev2sec2"><h2 class="title">Research Design-based Case Studies</h2>
<p class="noindent">A single-case research design (n = 1 trial) has already been discussed (<a href="/9788184484175/chapter/ch6" class="ulink-exter">Chapter 6</a>). Small variations can be made on that design in keeping with the nature of the study. The basic requirement of a good single-case study in mental health research is that both the baseline information as well as follow-up data should be collected for a sufficiently long duration.<a name="page112"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">112</span></span></p>
<div class="figure" id="ch8fig1" data-label="Fig. 8.1"><div class="title"><span class="item-label">Fig. 8.1</span> Single case-studies. <bold>A.</bold> The baseline suggests stability of symptoms.

Although an intervention might be instituted, its effect will be difficult to interpret</div><img alt="Fig. 8.1" src="/MediumImage/112-1.jpg"><div class="additional-markup"></div></div>
<p class="noindent">The baseline shows the trend before intervention, and allows a reasonable assumption about what would have happened in the immediate future in the absence of an intervention. The follow-up should be long enough to allow deducing the difference, if any, which the intervention has made. Stability, or a clear trend, is important for evaluating the impact of an intervention (<a href="#ch8fig1" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 8.1</a>). Visual inspection of the type of graphs drawn in <a href="#ch8fig1" class="ulink-inter">Figure 8.1</a> is a standard way of interpreting single-case studies because the usual tests of inferential statistics are inappropriate when n = 1.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch8lev2sec3"><h2 class="title">Quasi-experimental Case Studies</h2>
<p class="noindent">Non-formal case studies become more reliable as pieces of research and qualify for the status of quasi-experimental studies if they have some of the following features:<a name="page113"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">113</span></span></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p class="">objective, preferably quantitative, data,</p></li>
<li><p class="">multiple assessments over time, and</p></li>
<li><p class="">large number of cases.</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
</div><div class="section" id="ch8lev1sec2"><h1 class="title">ASSESSMENT METHODS</h1>
<p class="noindent">The most characteristic tool of assessment used in mental health research is the questionnaire. The nuances of developing a new questionnaire are so complex that that can be a research project in itself. Unless that is the intention, the tendency is to use a questionnaire developed and used earlier. Apart from being convenient, it also means that the validity, reliability, sensitivity and psychometric characteristics of the instrument are known, and the results of the study can be compared with those of previous studies in which the same questionnaire was used.</p>
<p class="indent">Sometimes, instead of using a standardized instrument exactly as it is, it may be modified a little, or a few items may be deleted from it. If that is done, its psychometric characteristics have to be determined again, but that is still easier than developing a new instrument altogether.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch8lev2sec4"><h2 class="title">Developing a New Test</h2>
<p class="noindent">The basic principles of psychometry (measuring psychological attributes) are to:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p class="">ask a large number of questions which are directly or indirectly related to the psychological attributes we wish to measure, and</p></li>
<li><p class="">assign marks to alternative modes of responding to questions such that high scores will all point in the same direction (usually presence of the attribute being measured).</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="indent">In this way, a psychological attribute can be quantified, and becomes amenable to statistical analysis in the same way as physical or biochemical attributes.</p>
<p class="indent">There are two types of tests: speed tests and power tests. Speed tests, commonly used for intellectual attributes, measure the number of questions answered correctly in a fixed time. In power tests, the testee can take as long as he likes, and the scoring depends on the responses.</p>
<p class="indent">Another way to classify tests is in terms of the format, i.e. self-report inventories; true/false, yes/no or multiple choice questionnaires; and scales asking for the subject's response along a spectrum (e.g. strongly agree, agree, neutral, disagree, strongly disagree; or a 5 or 7-point digital scale).<a name="page114"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">114</span></span></p>
<p class="indent">The development of a new test involves two major steps: test construction and test standardization.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch8lev3sec1"><h3 class="title">Test Construction</h3>
<p class="noindent">The preliminary steps in the construction of a test are to identify clearly the psychological attribute to be measured, the population in which it has to be measured, the language in which the test will be constructed, and its format. Unless absolutely necessary, it is best to have only one type of questions in the test.</p>
<p class="indent">Once the preliminary steps are over, a draft questionnaire is prepared. It should have more questions than intended in the final questionnaire. The questions should be examined critically for their clarity, lack of ambiguity, relevance to the attribute to be measured, etc., not only by the person who has prepared the draft but also by some of his colleagues and friends. In the process some questions will get deleted or modified, and some new ones will get added. Then a scoring system should be worked out, and the questionnaire administered to a few persons to see how it works. Then it may be administered under standard conditions to a somewhat larger number for determination of reliability and validity.<sup><a href="#ch8fn1" class="ulink-inter">1</a></sup> Then a draft is prepared in which test items with poor reliability and validity are eliminated.</p>
<p class="indent">The next step is to administer the test to a small number of subjects (less than 100). The time taken to answer the test is determined, and any flaws detected at this stage are removed.</p>
<p class="indent">The next step (actual try-out) is to administer the test to about 400 subjects, and compute the difficulty and discrimination indices for each item. At this stage, the subjects may also be given a similar existing and established test (a parallel test). If that is done, the correlation between the scores in the new test and the older parallel test is also determined. After the actual try-out, enough data is available for preparation of the final draft.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Difficulty Index:</span> The difficulty level of each item in the test can be determined by various methods. The simplest formula calculates the percentage of subjects who responded correctly to the test, i.e.</p>
<div class="informalfigure"><img alt="" src="/MediumImage/114-1.jpg"></div>
<p class="">_____________</p>
<p class="noindent"><sup class="footnote" id="ch8fn1">[<a href="#d1e6480">22</a>]</sup></p>
<p class="indent"><a name="page115"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">115</span></span>Another method requires ranking of the subjects into the top one-third (High group), middle one-third and low one-third (Low group) on the basis of the total score.</p>
<p class="indent">Then, difficulty level = 100 – (H+L) / 2, where H is the percentage of correct responses in the high group and L is the percentage of correct responses in the low group. Yet another index of difficulty uses the formula,</p>
<p class="indent">[(H + L) / n] × 100</p>
<p class="indent">where H is the number of correct responses in the high group, L is the number of correct responses in the low group, and n is the total number of testees in the two groups. However, as may be observed, the more difficult a question, the lower will be the value obtained by this formula. Hence this index may be called the ‘easiness index’.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Discrimination Index:</span> The discrimination index measures the efficiency with which the item distinguishes the high-performers from the low performers. It may also be calculated by various methods.</p>
<p class="indent">One method compares the percentage of correct responses in the high group with that in the low group for statistical significance.</p>
<p class="indent">Another method depends on the correlation coefficient between the score in the item being analysed and the total test score. Items with a higher correlation coefficient naturally also have a higher capacity to discriminate between the high and low groups.</p>
<p class="indent">Yet another index of discrimination uses the formula,</p>
<div class="informalfigure"><img alt="" src="/MediumImage/115-1.jpg"></div>
<p class="indent">where H is the number of correct responses in the high group, L is the number of correct responses in the low group, and n is the total number of testees in the two groups.</p>
<p class="indent">The discrimination index is also considered a measure of the validity of a test because items with high discriminating capacity usually also have high validity.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch8lev3sec2"><h3 class="title">Test Standardization</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this step the final draft is tested on large groups for preparation of norms. A norm is the average, typical, or range of scores obtained on a test when administered to a given population. Norms should include the frequency distribution of scores so that the percentile to which a given testee belongs can be determined. The percentile rank of an individual gives the percentage of the population that has scores less than his score.<a name="page116"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">116</span></span></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch8lev2sec5"><h2 class="title">Limitations of Psychometric Tests</h2>
<p class="noindent">Measuring psychological attributes through questionnaires has several limitations apart from the obvious flaw in quantifying an essentially immeasurable entity. Several factors other than the attribute being measured affect the responses of the testee. In general, there is a tendency to agree rather than disagree, to avoid extreme responses, and in intervention studies, to give responses which would make the intervention seem beneficial. In a few negativistic subjects, exactly the opposite type of distortion may be introduced by their tendency to say ‘no’ to everything, to give extreme responses, and to make the intervention appear useless. Distortion may also occur because the subject may try to give socially desirable answers so as to make a good impression.</p>
<p class="indent">However, inspite of these limitations, the score generally gives a good idea of the attribute being measured, and that is why such tests are still around and new ones continue to be developed.</p>
</div>
</div><div class="section" id="ch8lev1sec3"><h1 class="title">CLOSING WORDS</h1>
<p class="noindent">Techniques of qualitative research are being increasingly used in mental health research: these form the subject matter of <a href="/9788184484175/chapter/ch10" class="ulink-exter">Chapter 10</a>. Further, basic studies on behaviour might employ psychophysiological techniques such as autonomic function tests, brain imaging techniques, or the Skinner box. In short, as emphasized previously, there is no rigid boundary that divides the research methods of one area in life sciences or medicine from those of another.</p>
