If done on humans, the question arises whether human beings are guinea pigs. If actually done on guinea pigs, a still more relevant question is what right we have to inflict suffering on animals for our own welfare. Animal research forms the subject of the next chapter. However, so far as human research is concerned, every time a doctor administers treatment to a patient, he performs an experiment. In spite of the best intentions of the doctor, correctness of the diagnosis, and evidence for efficacy of the treatment, in a particular patient the treatment may or may not work. The response of the patient is the outcome of the experiment performed by the doctor. However, routine treatment of patients is generally not considered research. It is only when an investigator does something to a patient which is not ordinarily accepted as essential for diagnosis or treatment that the procedure is considered an experiment. Medical research also depends on healthy human subjects. Any intervention – even administering a questionnaire – to a healthy person is an experiment. However, because of the somewhat negative and school-boyish connotations of the word ‘experiment’, experiments performed by scholars are generally called studies, investigations, inquiries, or simply research.</p><p>All research carries some risk for the subject. He might get injured in a road accident while travelling to participate in the research project. He might develop anxiety while filling up a questionnaire which makes him conscious about his being at high risk for heart disease. Leaving aside these remote and minor risks, there is a risk involved if the patient is given a novel treatment, or is denied established treatment for the sake of research. Further, if the subject is healthy, any risk <a name="page231"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">231</span></span>that he takes, like that of a venipuncture, is not for his personal benefit. The ethical justification for these risks is that the expected benefit from the research is far greater than the risks. Even if the subjects are not personally benefitted by the research, it is expected that the results would benefit humanity at large. In short, the basic premise of ethical considerations in research is that putting a few individuals at some risk is acceptable provided it is likely to lead to general good, and the good expected is much greater than the risk. It is this relativity of ethics which is the root of all conflicts. The scientists conducting the research tend to emphasize and magnify the benefits; the critics of research do the same with the risks. Scientists often have motivations other than the spirit of inquiry behind the research, such as degrees, jobs, promotions, rewards and recognition. The critics of research are also motivated at least by self-righteousness in addition to righting a wrong. Clearly, there are strong emotions involved. Emotions have a way of exploiting the intellect. The result is excellent arguments which justify the stand which was taken primarily on emotional grounds. That is how apparently sensible people may engage in a terrible war of words. Dispassionate evaluation of the risk-benefit ratio of a piece of research is essential to assess it from an ethical angle. Any such evaluation is necessarily subjective, but in spite of this limitation, a remarkable degree of agreement can be achieved among a group of neutral and disinterested individuals. That is why Ethics Committees play an important role in ensuring that research goes on, but stays within acceptable norms.</p><div class="section" id="ch16lev1sec1"><h1 class="title">HISTORICAL BACKGROUND</h1>
<p>The renowned ancient Indian physician, Charaka (c. 1500 B.C.), is the author of probably the first oath which graduating doctors had to take before entering the medical profession. A similar oath was written also by Hippocrates (400 B.C.), the father of modern medicine. Till the second World War (1939-1944), the Hippocratic oath provided the ethical guidelines for the conduct of physicians in patient care as well as medical research. However, after the second World War it came to light that helpless prisoners held in concentration camps in Hitler's Germany had been subjected to inhuman procedures in the name of medical research. What was further regrettable was that doctors had actively participated in these cruel experiments. Apparently, the Hippocratic oath had not been enough in preventing them from committing such crimes. Twenty three persons, mostly <a name="page232"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">232</span></span>physicians, were tried for the crimes at Nuremberg. At the conclusion of the trial, the Nuremberg Military Tribunal issued in 1947 a set of 10 guidelines, rather ‘commandments’, for research on human subjects. The guidelines are now famous as the Nuremberg Code. The World Medical Association (WMA), which also came into being in 1947, adopted in its General assembly held at Geneva in 1948, a contemporary version of the Hippocratic oath. In 1964, the WMA approved at Helsinki its ‘Recommendations Guiding Doctors in Clinical Research’, now known as the Declaration of Helsinki. The Declaration of Helsinki has since been revised in 1975, 1983, 1989, 1996 and 2000.</p>
<p>Drawing on the universal principles underlying international declarations, and adding to them guidelines of local relevance, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has also been issuing guidelines for research on human subjects since 1980. A comprehensive revision was published in 2000, which has been revised in 2006. The ICMR guidelines are available on its website.</p>
</div><div class="section" id="ch16lev1sec2"><h1 class="title">ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS AT DIFFERENT STAGES OF RESEARCH</h1>
<p>Ethical considerations are important at all stages of research from planning through publication and application.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch16lev2sec1"><h2 class="title">Planning</h2>
<p>The right time to think of ethical aspects is when the experiment is being planned. Some of the basic questions that need to be answered before much time has been spent on planning the experiment are whether the information sought is important, whether the necessary and relevant pre-human studies have been done, whether the human studies are necessary, and whether the proposed study is the only way and the best way to get the required information. If the answer to all these questions is ‘yes’, the next question to ask is whether the risk, harm, pain or suffering involved in the study are negligible compared to the benefit expected. A good question which the scientist should ask himself is whether he would be willing to subject himself and his near and dear ones to the experiment. If these questions have also been answered in the affirmative, the next thing to consider is whether the investigator is qualified and skilled to perform the experiment. It is not necessary that a single person should meet this requirement completely. But the team of investigators should together be competent to look after all aspects of the project. For example, all projects on medical research should have a medical doctor associated <a name="page233"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">233</span></span>with the project. In some cases the basic medical degree may not be enough; a specialist may be necessary. If the principal investigator is qualified in one system of medicine but the project has some elements of another system, a physician qualified in the other system should also be a part of the team.</p>
<p>The next question in planning the study is regarding who the subjects will be. The subjects should be free and competent to give their consent for participation. Strictly speaking, prisoners, soldiers, the investigator's patients and his students are not completely free. The prisoners might comply because of fear of punishment if they refuse, or incentive of a reward (such as more comfortable conditions or early release) if they agree to participate. The soldiers might participate under orders from their superiors. The subtle pressure to participate which the investigator's patients or students feel is easy to understand. The subjects should also be competent to give their consent for participation. For example, children and mentally ill persons may not understand the full implications of the study. Therefore, they are not competent to give their consent.</p>
<p>Last but not least, the experimental design should be the most appropriate one for the study. If the study is not designed properly, its results may be invalid or even erroneous. In that case, all the trouble taken by the subjects would be without any benefit to humanity, and therefore the experiment would be rendered unethical.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch16lev3sec1"><h3 class="title">Informed Consent</h3>
<p>Not only should the volunteers be free and competent to give their consent for participation in a study, they should do so after knowing the pros and cons involved. Preparing an ‘informed consent form’ is therefore a part of the planning. The form should be in simple language, preferably in one which the participant can read and understand. If that is not possible, the contents of the form should be translated for the participant before he signs it. A good informed consent form carries the following information:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Purpose of the study, i.e. the likely benefit to society.</p></li>
<li><p>Nature of the study, i.e. how the study will be conducted. Special emphasis should be laid on what will be done to the subject, and what the subject has to do. For example, the frequency with which blood will be drawn, the amount of the blood to be drawn, the number of X-rays that will be done, etc. should be given in precise detail. Further, the subject should know how frequently the subject has to come, how long it will take at each visit, and how long the study will go on.<a name="page234"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">234</span></span></p></li>
<li><p>The subject should be assured that information or data provided by him will be kept confidential. Further, he should be told that if and when published, the publication will be based on statistically processed data provided by a group of individuals. However, if in some case individual photographs or data have to be published, the subject should know it, and should also be assured that his identity will not be revealed in the publications, not even as initials.</p></li>
<li><p>The foreseeable risks to the subject. Even if only blood samples have to be taken, the form should say that ‘blood will be drawn from the antecubital vein using all sterile precautions. The risks involved are no more than in a routine venipuncture’.</p></li>
<li><p>Foreseeable benefits to the subject, if any.</p></li>
<li><p>The assurance that the subject is free to withdraw from the study at any time without assigning any reason. Further, the subject should be reassured that withdrawing from the study will not affect the doctor-patient or therapist-client relationship.</p></li>
<li><p>The assurance that in the unlikely event of a research-related injury or illness, free treatment will be provided by the investigator/hospital where the study is done.</p></li>
<li><p>The magnitude of the compensation, if any. The subject may be paid an ‘incentive’ to compensate for the time spent, loss of wages, inconvenience, conveyance expenses, etc. But the compensation should not be so large as to act as an inducement to participate. Part of the ‘incentive’ may be in the form of food (in a dietary study) or free medicines for treatment.</p></li>
<li><p>The offer that the subject is free to ask any questions about the study at any stage.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The informed consent form should be signed by the subject, the investigator (who certifies that the contents of the form have been explained to the subject), and a witness unrelated to the research study (who could be a relative of the subject).</p>
<p>The subject should also be provided a paper having the names and contact information of the investigators.</p>
<p>The informed consent form should be submitted along with the research proposal when it is submitted for a research grant or ethical approval. If some information has not been included in the consent form, the reason should be explained in the proposal. For example, the subject may be told that half the subjects will be getting a drug and half a placebo. But he obviously cannot be told what exactly he will be getting. In exceptional cases, the informed consent form may not be necessary. For example, if the study involves nothing more <a name="page235"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">235</span></span>than what would be anyway done for the person's treatment, making him conscious that he is being experimented upon might cause avoidable psychological trauma. Or, the study might be based on examination of the medical records or slides of patients treated in the past: here informed consent is neither feasible nor necessary. But in such cases also, ethical approval should be sought, along with the request for a waiver for informed consent.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch16lev2sec2"><h2 class="title">Approval by an Ethics Committee</h2>
<p>A conscientious investigator might feel why a committee should approve his project before he can begin the work. He might argue that he has followed all the ethical guidelines in force, and has also applied the acid test to his project – he would be willing to be a subject himself; in fact, he might be one of the subjects. These arguments are valid, and in most cases would ensure that the project is ethically sound. But still these arguments are not considered enough for the following reasons:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Guidelines seldom take care of all situations. Brief guidelines inevitably have many loopholes and leave behind many unanswered questions. Detailed guidelines which try to plug all loopholes and anticipate all situations are worse because they become so cumbersome that they become difficult to follow (in both senses of the word ‘follow’ – to understand, and to implement!). As somebody has said, too many laws weaken the necessary laws.</p></li>
<li><p>An investigator has personal interest in the project. Therefore he is likely to interpret any lacunae in the guidelines in his favour, magnify the expected benefits of his research, and underestimate the risks involved in the study.</p></li>
<li><p>The fact that the investigator is also a subject in the study is no guarantee of its ethical validity. Because of his personal, and perhaps passionate, involvement in the study, the investigator might be willing to take unreasonable risks. But there is no reason why others should also take the same degree of risk.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In short, even a conscientious investigator cannot be always relied upon to judge his own project objectively. That is why we need a disinterested observer to judge the project. Joseph Fletcher has quoted Roderick Firth, who put together five traits of the ‘ideal observer’: he is omniscient – knows all the relevant facts; omnipercepient – can imagine all human feelings involved; disinterested – is impartial and without self-interest; dispassionate – free of emotional bias; and <a name="page236"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">236</span></span>consistent – uses generalizable principles to fit similar situations. If you have by now concluded that these are the characteristics of God, you are absolutely right. A human being with this set of five traits does not exist. That is why, instead of one observer we should have a group of observers. A group does not automatically acquire the five traits, but is better than an individual because members of the group tend to neutralise one another's bias, error and negativity. Such a group of individuals constitutes the Ethics Committee.</p>
<p>Every institution which conducts human research should have an Ethics Committee for Use of Human Subjects. If your institution does not have such a committee, you may request that it be constituted, and in the meantime seek the guidance of a national agency (like ICMR in India) for the ethical clearance of your proposed project. An Institutional Ethics Committee (IEC) should have 5-10 members as follows: basic medical scientists and clinicians (one or two each), one legal expert, one social scientist or representative of a non-governmental organisation, one philosopher or ethicist, and one lay person. The Chairperson of the committee should be from outside the institution, and the Member-Secretary from the institution. The Member-Secretary is responsible for the administrative work related to the business of the IEC.</p>
<p>An IEC meets periodically to consider the projects received. It does better than the guidelines because it looks at each project on its own merits. Further, it not only approves or rejects, but also suggests how the project might be made more sound from the ethical angle. The function of the IEC does not end with approval of a project. It also monitors the implementation of the project. The investigator is expected to send a periodic (six-monthly or annual) report on the progress of the project and certify that all ethical guidelines are being followed. Further, if a mid-course change has to be made in the protocol, approval of the IEC is sought for the change.</p>
<p>If your institution has an IEC, a good time to submit your research proposal to them is when you also submit it to a funding agency for a research grant. You may tell the funding agency that the proposal has been submitted for approval to the IEC. Since the IEC and the funding agency will both take time to process the proposal, you can generally start the project faster if it is submitted to both simultaneously. Although the IEC may not need some of the details included in the research grant application (<a href="/9788184484175/chapter/ch12" class="ulink-exter">Chapter 12</a>), it is simpler and safer to submit exactly the same document to both. The IEC may, however, be also given some additional facts, viz.<a name="page237"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">237</span></span></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Has the permission of the Drug Controller of India been obtained for the use of drug/vaccine/device to be studied?</p></li>
<li><p>Details of the pre-human studies available on the drug/vaccine.</p></li>
<li><p>Foreign collaborators in the project, if any.</p></li>
<li><p>Will samples of blood or any other biological material be sent out of the country? If so, has permission by the appropriate authority been granted?</p></li>
</ol>
<p>While screening a project, an Ethics Committee first looks at what type, or rather level, of research it is. From the ethical angle, there are three levels of research (Wolfensberger 1967). In level 1 research, data is collected in the course of patient management. It is not consciously recognized as research. In fact, the idea to use the data for research might occur considerably after it has been collected. This type of research does not even need the patient's consent, and the Ethical Committee is pleased to approve it promptly. Level 2 research is also related to patient management, but is planned primarily as an experimental study. However, the procedures used are well-established, the new knowledge sought is modest, and the likely outcome of research can be reasonably well predicted in advance. Such projects also pose no major difficulty in clearance from the ethical angle. In level 3 research, the subject may or may not be a patient. The research is unrelated to the clinical care of the subjects. On top of this, if the procedures or drugs involved are untried, or the likely risk to the subjects is substantial, close scrutiny from the ethical angle becomes essential even if the expected benefits to humanity are substantial.</p>
<p>In short, therapeutic research has fewer ethical dilemmas associated with it. Here the main ethical concern is whether efficacious and established treatment for a serious ailment is being denied to all or some of the subjects. Non-therapeutic research, carried out primarily for acquisition of knowledge, is responsible for most of the ethical issues in human research.</p>
<p>Irrespective of the type of research, a conscientious investigator who has studied the ethical guidelines and has decided to follow them in letter and spirit will seldom have difficulty in getting his project cleared by an Ethics Committee.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch16lev2sec3"><h2 class="title">Execution</h2>
<p>It is when the project is actually carried out that the investigators determine whether the ethical guidelines are followed only in letter or also in spirit. In many situations, it is quite possible to reduce <a name="page238"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">238</span></span>‘informal written consent’ to a ritual involving no more than signing a sheet of paper. To save time, the information to be given to the subjects before they sign the consent form may be given to all of them together in a meeting. In the meeting, they may also ask any questions they might have. The most important points to clarify are that the subjects may withdraw from the study at any stage for any reason whatsoever, and that dropping out of the study will not in any way prejudice the benefits (such as medical treatment) to which they are otherwise entitled. Regarding the incentive, if they withdraw from the study, the incentive should be proportional to the degree of participation irrespective of the value or utility of the data collected on the subject. No subtle pressure or inducement should be used to induce the participant to join or complete the study.</p>
<p>Periodic analysis of data while the study is in progress is desirable anyway, but is also important from the ethical angle. If the benefits or adverse effects of a new treatment are so striking that the difference between the treatment and placebo groups is statistically significant before the planned number of subjects have completed the study (or if the difference is visible to the clinician in spite of double blinding), it is ethical to terminate the study midway. It is clearly unethical to continue the study if there are striking adverse effects because the first principle of medical ethics is ‘do no harm’. It is also unethical to continue the study if the benefits are striking because the new treatment should become generally available as soon as possible rather than wait for the formal completion of the trial.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch16lev2sec4"><h2 class="title">Reporting</h2>
<p>There are important ethical considerations for reporting the results of research at a conference or in a thesis or research paper. Apart from keeping the identity of participants confidential and protecting their privacy, there are also considerations which may not directly affect the participants. The data should not be doctored to appear more convincing or valuable. This can be done not only by tampering with numerical data but also by choosing an inappropriate mode of presentation. For example, the data on subjects too few to be of value may be presented without giving the ‘n value’, or the scales used in graphs may be such as to magnify even small differences. Other fraudulent practices are to publish the same data in slightly different forms more than once, or to split the data in order to inflate the number of publications.<a name="page239"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">239</span></span></p>
<p>The most effective check on unethical reporting is, once again, the conscience of the investigators. However, referees and editors also have a role in safeguarding subjects as well as the integrity of scientific literature. As a principle, journals should refuse to publish a paper unless the authors state that the protocol has been approved by an ethics committee, and that the work has neither been published earlier nor is under consideration with another journal. According to H.K. Beecher, even valuable data, if improperly obtained, should not be published (Beecher 1966).</p>
</div>
</div><div class="section" id="ch16lev1sec3"><h1 class="title">SELF-EXPERIMENTATION</h1>
<p>Medical research has a long and glorious history of self-experimentation. Scientists have exposed themselves to considerable suffering and risk, and in some cases have even died in the course of experimenting upon themselves. Self-experimentation has been extolled for the courage and spirit of sacrifice shown by the scientists, and also criticized for the poor scientific value of foolhardy experiments carried out on a single subject. Altman (1972) has enumerated the reasons for which a scientist might decide to be his own subject. Probably the first and foremost is the freedom to ignore ethical considerations. Werner Forssmann was the first to conduct cardiac catheterization on himself in 1929. In that era the procedure was considered so risky that it would have been unethical to try it on anybody else. Forssmann, then just 25 and full of the reckless idealism of youth, convinced a fellow resident to catheterize him under fluoroscopic control. By the time the catheter had reached Forssmann's axilla, his friend got so scared that he abandoned the effort. Forssmann completed the task himself with a radiographer holding a mirror in front of the screen. He then climbed the stairs to a room with an X-ray machine where the position of the catheter was confirmed and documented in the X-ray of the chest. In the 1940s, a group of biochemists at the University of Illinois conducted studies on essential amino acids on themselves because it would not have been (and even today it is not) permissible for them to use other human subjects since none of them had a medical degree. Besides such ethical or legal reasons, other factors which motivate self-experimentation are a spirit of adventure, burning curiosity and convenience. In some cases, the investigator may be only one of the subjects. Besides being a morale booster, it also includes at least one ‘reference’ subject in the group who can be depended upon to be 100% reliable. This is particularly important in some nutritional experiments which might require difficult dietary restrictions. For example, in experiments on zinc balance, the subject <a name="page240"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">240</span></span>is given zinc-free water to drink. Taking even one glass of ordinary water in the day will lead to bizarre results. However, as pointed out earlier, simply volunteering to be one of the subjects does not free the investigator from following ethical guidelines. Just because he is prepared to take a lot of personal risk for the sake of relatively meagre general good does not give him the right to expose others to the same risk.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<h2 class="title">WILLIAM STARK : A MARTYR TO SCIENTIFIC CURIOSITY</h2>
<p>William Stark, a young medical graduate of age 29, was inspired by anecdotes regarding excellent health preserved on very simple diets, and his observations on the poor who seemed to be healthy in spite of monotonous diets. In order to study for himself the minimum variety of food necessary for life, he repeatedly went on experimental diets which were based on just bread and water. When he found that bread and water alone led to tiredness, bleeding gums and inflammation around the mouth, he added other components such as sugar, olive oil or milk, one at a time, to see which combination was just enough to stay in good health. He observed milk to be a very valuable addition to bread and water. But unfortunately, he did not stick to this combination long enough because of his eagerness to try many other combinations. The result was that his health kept deteriorating as a result of self-experimentation. He developed signs and symptoms which today look like manifestations of multiple nutritional deficiencies. He died in 1770, a victim of his experiments, less than a year after starting them.</p>
</div>
</div><div class="section" id="ch16lev1sec4"><h1 class="title">THE OTHER SIDE: EXPLOITING ETHICS</h1>
<p>As discussed earlier, the essence of ethics of experimentation is a dispassionate assessment of the risk-benefit ratio. Quite understandably, scientists may not be dispassionate while making this assessment, specially when it comes to their own experiments. Therefore, watchdogs such as ethical guidelines and ethics committees are necessary. But quite often the critics of experimentation are also not dispassionate in assessing the risk-benefit ratio of scientific studies. Some of these critics have hardly any background of science, and therefore, do not even understand the studies. However, that does not prevent them from criticizing the studies with the zeal of self-righteousness. With a little effort, they can also get undeserved publicity because journalism thrives on sensationalism. Depending on the tact and influence of the critics, the government might respond by making the rule book thicker and expanding the bureaucracy for implementing it. For the scientists, it all translates into a disheartening amount of very time-consuming paperwork. The sad part is that wasting so much time on infructuous tasks does not improve even the ethical standards. Under these circumstances, following the rules <a name="page241"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">241</span></span>in letter becomes more important than the spirit behind the rules (Ingelfinger 1975). The major preoccupation of the scientist becomes ensuring flawless paperwork. The number and length of forms that the volunteers have to sign multiply so much that even the volunteer is not interested in reading them. He takes it as a mere formality, and signs on all the dotted lines without reading the forms. Incidentally, procedures for ensuring ethics in research have assumed this ridiculous dimension in developed countries rather than in India. But since we are moving in the same direction, it may be worthwhile learning from their experience. The golden mean seems to be achieved by Institutional Ethics Committees which consider each project on its merits in relation to a set of brief and general guidelines provided by a national agency like ICMR.</p>
</div><div class="section" id="ch16lev1sec5"><h1 class="title">BEYOND ETHICS</h1>
<p>An ethical code helps us in resolving the conflict between two desirable activities – in the present context, between avoiding risk to individuals and working towards the benefit to many. In <span class="italic">The Gita</span> also, Arjuna is faced with a similar conflict between two virtues – non-violence on one hand, and fighting a righteous war on the other. The way Krishna resolved the question ‘to fight or not’ can also guide an investigator towards arriving at a supra-ethical answer to the question ‘to conduct a given experiment or not’. Based on Sri Aurobindo's <span class="italic">Essays on the Gita,</span> in order to arrive at such an answer based on absolute values, the investigator should ask himself the following questions. The option for which the answer to all these questions is ‘yes’ is the right choice.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Is the option chosen irrespective of egoistic considerations?</p></li>
<li><p>Is the option chosen irrespective of consideration of any material gain or loss?</p></li>
<li><p>Is the option chosen driven by divine love? Divine love is universal, unconditional and does not expect anything in return.</p></li>
<li><p>Will the option chosen lead to lasting mental peace? This is the final and most crucial question.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The human intellect is so versatile, innovative and creative that it can justify any option chosen on the basis of first three of the above questions. Thus the option might have been chosen primarily on an impulse driven by self-aggrandizement and material gain, but one can deny that, and emphasize the love one feels for the suffering humanity as basis for the choice. The intellect can then go into <a name="page242"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">242</span></span>overdrive and find numerous reasons to prove that divine love for one's fellow beings is the primary motivation behind the decision. By repeating the arguments again and again, one can almost reach a point where not only others can be convinced, even the person himself feels convinced that it is truly so. However, while doing so, there is one faint whisper from somewhere deep within which the person persists in ignoring during this entire process. The faint whisper tells him that he is exploiting his intellect to justify a decision that is basically unethical. This voice is not based on reason but reflects truth and gives an instant intuitive judgement which is far more reliable than clever arguments – one might loosely call it a gut feeling based on the conscience. When a person asks himself whether his decision will give him <span class="italic">lasting</span> mental peace, this voice grows in its intensity and tells him ‘no’ – the voice tells him that the decision will make him feel guilty sooner or later. He may succeed in suppressing this voice with intellectual arguments, but he knows in the heart of his hearts that this voice will continue to make him uneasy periodically; it will haunt him at least on his deathbed, if not earlier. Therefore, when the person asks himself <span class="italic">sincerely</span> the question whether his decision will leave him in peace <span class="italic">for ever,</span> whether he will be at peace even on his deathbed, he gets an instant answer. When he asks this question sincerely, his inner voice becomes loud and clear, it overrides all mental considerations, and tells him ‘yes’, he will be able to die in peace; or ‘no’, he will be disturbed by the feeling that he had cheated himself through clever arguments. If an investigator has screened his project through these four questions, particularly the last one, and still reached the conclusion that the project is ethically sound, no ethics committee will be able to reject the project. The reason is that these questions are based on absolute values, whereas ethics is relative. A project which is valid in terms of absolute values has passed the supra-ethical test, and therefore cannot fail the much more lenient ethical test. This does not mean that if the project has passed the supra-ethical test, it need not be submitted to an ethics committee. Following the law of the land is our first duty – after that, we are always at liberty to behave better than what the minimum legal requirements are.</p>
</div><div class="section" id="ch16lev1sec6"><h1 class="title">CLOSING THOUGHTS</h1>
<p>Once a set of national guidelines for the ethical consideration in medical research have been formulated by an agency such as ICMR, there are three watchdogs to ensure their implementation. First, the institutions <a name="page243"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">243</span></span>where research is conducted should have institutional ethics committees. Approval of the IEC should be mandatory for all research projects carried out in the institution. As a safeguard, the institution should not forward any research grant application to a funding agency unless the project has at least been submitted to the IEC. Second, the funding agencies should not release the research grant unless it has been approved by an ethics committee. Third, the referees of research articles should point out any doubts about the ethical validity of the research, and the editors of journals should refuse to publish even otherwise satisfactory articles if there is any doubt about the work being ethically sound. In fact, the editors should insist that the protocol of the study should have been approved by an ethics committee for the article to qualify for being accepted. All these check posts serve a useful purpose, but none of them can guarantee ethics in research. They cannot determine the several decisions which the investigators have to make everyday while the study is on. The ultimate guarantee is the conscience of the investigators, who should feel personally responsible for implementing at least the ethical guidelines in letter and spirit.</p>
