<p class="noindent">The endocrine glands are ductless glands. They secrete hormones in the interstitial spaces from where they are absorbed into the bloodstream. Most of the biological phenomena of body are under control of both endocrine and nervous system so they are regarded as a single neuroendocrine system. The endocrine glands exist either as discrete organs or tissues found in association with other organs. The discrete endocrine glands are:</p>

</div><div class="section" id="ch16lev1sec2"><h1 class="title">PITUITARY GLAND/HYPOPHYSIS CEREBRI</h1>
<p class="noindent">It is regarded as master of endocrine orchestra because some of the hormones secreted by it control the secretory activity of other endocrine glands. However, its own activity is under the influence of hormones produced by the hypothalamus.</p>
<p class="noindent"><bold>Structure:</bold> This gland consists of two lobes anterior or adenohypophysis which produces and secretes most of the hormones and posterior or neurohypophysis that stores and releases neurohormones received from the hypothalamus.</p>
<p class="noindent">The adenohypophysis is divided into three parts by a cleft or cyst:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Pars distalis/anterior</span>—lies in front of hypophyseal cleft</p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Pars tuberalis</span>—a cranial projection of pars distalis which surrounds the infundibulum</p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Pars intermedia</span> between hypophysial cleft and neurohypophysis.</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="noindent">The neurohypophysis is divided into two parts:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Pars nervosa</span>—posterior to pars intermedia</p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Infundibulum</span>—the stalk that connects the pars nervosa to the hypothalamus.</p></li>
</ol>
<div class="section" id="ch16lev2sec1"><h2 class="title">Microscopically</h2>
<p class="noindent">Pars distalis consists of anastomosing cords or clumps of cells and sinusoids. About 50% cells are chromophobes which do not take any staining (due to no secretary granules), remaining 50% cells are chromophils which take staining (due to presence of secretary granules). The chromophils are divided into acidophils or alpha cells (35–40%) and basophils or beta cells (10–15%). Pars intermedia consist of groups of polygonal cells and colloid filled cysts. The cells take light basophilic staining. Some of them take deep basophilic staining like basophils. Pars nervosa consists of large number of unmyelinated nerve fibers and modified highly branched neuroglial cells called pituicytes which are not stainable with H/E staining.</p>

Deficiency of ADH in lesion of hypothalamus leads to diabetes insipidus in which there is excessive thrust for liquid/water, excretes excess of urine about 20 liter/day called polyuria.)</p>

</div><div class="section" id="ch16lev1sec3"><h1 class="title">ADRENAL GLAND/SUPRARENAL GLAND</h1>
<p class="noindent">Each gland has a peripheral cortex and a central medulla.</p>
<p class="indent">Microscopically, each gland is covered by a thick capsule which sends septae along with blood vessels. Just beneath the capsule lies a subcapsular plexus of arterioles.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Cortex</span> consists of three zones namely zona glomerulosa, zona fasciculata and zona reticularis from superficial to deep.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Zona glomerulosa</span> forms arches of columnar/pyramidal cells having acidophilic cytoplasm with few lipid droplets. The capillaries are present between arches.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Zona fasciculata</span> is the thickest zone which forms parallel cords of polyhedral cells having faint cytoplasm with many lipid droplets. The lipid droplets give a spongy appearance, so the cells are called spongiocytes. The capillaries are present between the cords of cells.<a name="page165"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">165</span></span></p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Zona reticularis</span> forms small irregular anastomosing cords of cells having more acidophilic cytoplasm than those of the other two zones. The cytoplasm contains few lipid droplets, lipofuscin pigments and glycogen. In between the cords are present dilated sinusoids.</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="noindent"><bold>Medulla</bold> forms cords/clumps of chromaffin cells/pheochromocytes (modified sympathetic neurons). The cells are supported by the fine reticular fibers. The capillaries are present in between the cords. Apart from the chromaffin cells, few parasympathetic ganglion cells are also present. The chromaffin cells take dark brown staining with chromium salts like potassium dichromate, due to oxidation of catecholamine in the cytoplasm, a process known as chromaffin reaction.</p>
<p class="indent">The cortex produces steroid hormones. The zona glomerulosa secretes mineralocorticoids (primarily aldosterone) which maintain water and electrolyte balance of the body. The zona fasciculata secretes glucocorticoids (mainly cortisol and small amount of corticosterone and cortisone) which regulate carbohydrate, protein and fat metabolism. The zona reticularis secretes small amount of androgen and glucocorticoids. The medulla produces catecholamine (epinephrine and norepinephrine/adrenaline and noradrenaline).</p>
<p class="indent">Hyperadrenalism/hyperfunction of cortex results into Cushing's syndrome (increased glucocorticoids) and Conn's syndrome (increased aldosterone). Hypoadrenalism/hypofunction of cortex results into Addison's disease (decreased glucocorticoids). During emotional reaction such as fright, the medulla secretes more catecholamine causing vasoconstriction, hypertension, increased heart rate and increased blood glucose level. Tumors of medulla/phaeochromocytoma causes transient rise of blood pressure.</p>
</div><div class="section" id="ch16lev1sec4"><h1 class="title">THYROID GLAND</h1>
<p class="noindent">It is covered by two capsules, an inner fibro-fatty true capsule and an outer fascial false capsule. Microscopically, this gland is composed of connective tissue stroma and glandular parenchyma.</p>
<p class="indent">The stroma or connective tissue framework includes the fibroelastic capsule sending delicate septae inside dividing the gland into ill-defined lobules. The intralobular loose areolar and reticular tissue provide bed for parenchyma and blood vessels. The parenchyma includes thyroid follicles. Each follicle is the structural and functional unit of the gland and lined by simple cuboidal epithelium of follicular cells. The follicular cells synthesize and secrete thyroid hormones tri-iodothyronine (T3) and tetra-iodothyronine (T4). The lumen of the follicles contains a homogenous gel like substance called colloid or thyroglobulin which is stored inactive thyroid hormones. The follicles may be in active or resting phase and their secretory activity is controlled by the TSH of adenohypophysis. Some large pale staining cells are present either singly or in small groups within the follicles or between the follicles in the interfollicular space called parafollicular or clear or C cells. Those found within the follicular epithelium never reach the follicular lumen. These C cells synthesize and secrete the hormone calcitonin which is antagonist to parathormone. Calcitonin lowers blood calcium by inhibiting bone resorption. The differences between resting and active follicles: (i) Large and small, (ii) lining epithelium squamous with few microvilli on luminal surface and cuboidal or low columnar with more microvilli, (iii) Nucleus dark or pale and (iv) large amount of colloid and small amount of colloid with scalloped border.</p>
<p class="indent">(In iodine deficiency, enlargement of thyroid is called Goitre in which there is decreased thyroid hormone synthesis called hypothyroidism leading to cretinism in children and myxedema in adult. In Grave's disease or exophthalmic Goitre there is hyperthyroidism or thyrotoxicosis leading to raised basal metabolic rate, heat intolerance, tachycardia, weight loss, tremors etc.)</p>
</div><div class="section" id="ch16lev1sec5"><h1 class="title">PARATHYROID GLAND</h1>
<p class="noindent">It secretes parathormone which controls metabolism of calcium and phosphorus. Parathyroid glands are essential for life because they regulate calcium and phosphorus levels in blood. In the event of their removal, blood calcium level falls resulting into tetanic contraction of respiratory and laryngeal muscles leading to death.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">A thin connective tissue capsule with capillaries and blood vessels separates the thyroid gland from the parathyroid gland.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Connective tissue trabeculae from the capsule extend into the parathyroid gland and bring larger blood vessels into its interior, where they branch into capillaries around the parathyroid cells.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The parathyroid gland cells are arranged into anastomosing cords and clump</p></li>
<li><p class="">Cells are of two types: the chief (principal) cells and the oxyphil cells.<a name="page166"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">166</span></span></p></li>
<li><p class="">The chief cells are smaller and more numerous and have round, pale and slightly acidophilic cytoplasm.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The oxyphil cells are found singly or in small clumps and are larger and less numerous than the chief cells, and have eosinophilic cytoplasm with smaller, darker-staining nuclei.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Numerous blood vessels surround the secretory cells.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">(In hyperparathyroidism, increased secretion of parathormone due to depletion of bone calcium, calcium deposition in several organs like kidney, bones become weak, more fracture condition called ‘Osteitis fibrosa cystica’. Hypoparathyroidism is rare, due to surgical removal during thyroidectomy, decreased blood calcium level, bones become denser and more mineralized, muscles undergo convulsion called tetany.)<a name="page167"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">167</span></span></p>

<div class="section" id="ch16lev2sec5"><h2 class="title">Clinical Correlation/Vertical Integration</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Lesions of the hypothalamus that destroy the neurosecretory cells that produce antidiuretic hormone, cause <bold>diabetes insipidus,</bold> a disease characterized by loss of renal capacity to concentrate urine. As a result, an individual suffering from this disease may excrete up to 20 L of urine per day (polyuria) and will drink enormous quantities of liquids.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Tumors of the hypophysis:</bold> Tumors of the hypophysis are usually adenomas and thus are benign, although the tumor may compress neighboring structures (such as the optic nerves). About two-thirds of them produce hormones that cause clinical symptoms. These tumors can produce growth hormone, prolactin, adrenocorticotropin, and, less frequently, thyroid-stimulating hormone. Clinical diagnosis of these tumors can be confirmed by immunocytochemical methods after surgical removal.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Because of the feedback mechanism of adrenal cortex control, patients who are treated with corticoids for long periods should never stop taking these hormones suddenly. Secretion of ACTH in these patients is inhibited, and thus the cortex will not be induced to produce corticoids, causing a severe misbalance in the levels of sodium and potassium.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Epinephrine and norepinephrine are secreted in large quantities in response to intense emotional reactions, such as fright, that are part of an alarm reaction (the fight-or-flight response). Secretion of these substances is mediated by the preganglionic fibers that innervate medullary cells. Vasoconstriction, hypertension, changes in heart rate, and metabolic effects such as elevated blood glucose result from the secretion and release of catecholamines into the bloodstream. During normal activity, the medulla continuously secretes small quantities of these hormones.</p></li>
<li><p class="">One disorder of the adrenal medulla is <bold>pheochromocytoma,</bold> a tumor of its cells that causes transient elevations of blood pressure. These tumors can also develop in extramedullary sites.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Disorders of the adrenal cortex can be classified as <bold>hyperfunctional</bold> or <bold>hypofunctional.</bold> Tumors of the adrenal cortex can result in excessive production of glucocorticoids (<bold>Cushing syndrome</bold>) or aldosterone (<bold>Conn syndrome</bold>). Cushing syndrome is most often (90%) due to a pituitary adenoma that produces excessive ACTH; it is rarely caused by adrenal hyperplasia or an adrenal tumor. Excessive production of adrenal androgens has little effect in men. However, hirsutism (abnormal hair growth) is seen in women, and precocious puberty (in boys) and virilization (in girls) are encountered in prepubertal children. These adrenogenital syndromes are the result of several enzymatic defects in steroid metabolism that cause increased biosynthesis of androgens by the adrenal cortex.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Adrenocortical insufficiency (<bold>Addison disease</bold>) is caused by destruction of the adrenal cortex in some diseases. The signs and symptoms result from failure of secretion of both glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids by the adrenal cortex.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Carcinomas of the adrenal cortex are rare, but most are highly malignant. About 90% of them produce steroids.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Insulin-dependent</bold> or <bold>type I diabetes</bold> (juvenile diabetes) results from partial or total destruction of B cells due to an autoimmune disease, the individual susceptibility to which is controlled by several genes. <bold>Insulin-independent diabetes</bold> or <bold>type II diabetes</bold> occurs at a later stage in life and is frequently associated with obesity.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Tumors of islet cells may produce insulin, glucagon, somatostatin, and pancreatic polypeptide. Some pancreatic tumors produce two or more of these hormones simultaneously, generating complex clinical symptoms.</p></li>
<li><p class="">A diet low in iodine hinders the synthesis of thyroid hormones, causing increased secretion of TSH and compensatory growth of the thyroid gland, a condition known as <bold>iodine deficiency goiter,</bold> which occurs endemically in some regions of the world. Some of these patients may suffer from hypothyroidism, whereas children who are hypothyroid from birth may present <bold>cretinism,</bold> characterized by arrested physical and mental development.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Adult hypothyroidism may result from diseases of the thyroid gland (e.g., due to defects in hormone synthesis and release), or may be secondary to pituitary or hypothalamic failure. Autoimmune diseases of the thyroid, such as Hashimoto's disease, may impair its function, with consequent hypothyroidism. In this disease it is possible to detect antibodies against thyroid tissue in the patient's blood. As with other autoimmune malfunctions, Hashimoto's disease is more common in women.<a name="page173"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">173</span></span></p></li>
<li><p class="">Hyperthyroidism may be caused by a variety of thyroid diseases, of which the most common is <bold>Graves’ disease,</bold> characterized physically by bulging of the eyes (exophthalmos). This thyroid hyperfunction is due to an immunological dysfunction, with production of a circulating immunoglobulin (long-acting thyroid stimulator—LATS) that binds to thyrotropin receptors in thyroid follicular cells stimulating their function. In addition to eye protrusion, patients with Graves’ disease exhibit decreased body weight, nervousness, asthenia, and accelerated heart rate.</p></li>
<li><p class="">In <bold>hyperparathyroidism,</bold> concentrations of blood phosphate are decreased and concentrations of blood Ca<sup>2+</sup> are increased. This condition frequently produces pathological deposits of calcium in several organs, such as the kidneys and arteries. The bone disease caused by hyperparathyroidism, which is characterized by an increased number of osteoclasts and multiple bone cavities, is known as <bold>osteitis fibrosa cystica.</bold> Bones from patients with osteitis fibrosa cystica are less resistant and are prone to fractures.</p></li>
<li><p class="">In <bold>hypoparathyroidism,</bold> concentrations of blood phosphate are increased and concentrations of blood Ca<sup>2+</sup> are decreased. The bones become denser and more mineralized. This condition causes spastic contractions of the skeletal muscles and generalized convulsions called <bold>tetany.</bold> These symptoms are caused by the exaggerated excitability of the nervous system, due to the lack of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the blood. Patients with hypoparathyroidism are treated with calcium salts and vitamin D.</p></li>
