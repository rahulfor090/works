<p class="noindent">The teeth are anchored (secured firmly in position) to the sockets of the alveolar processes of maxilla and mandible. The alveolar processes are covered by gingival or gum. In human being there are two sets of teeth namely:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">The deciduous or milk teeth</span>—10 in each jaw, which are later replaced by permanent teeth</p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">The permanent teeth</span>—16 in each jaw.</p></li>
</ol>
<div class="section" id="ch12lev2sec1"><h2 class="title">Histological Structure of a Tooth</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Crown:</bold> It is the visible part of tooth above the gum.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Root:</bold> It is the concealed part of tooth embedded in the gum. It has an apical foramen at the tip.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Neck:</bold> It is the constricted junctional region between crown and root.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">The pulp cavity and root canal are found in the interior of crown and root respectively and filled with the dentinal pulp.</p>
<p class="noindent">The tooth is made of two types of tissues:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p class="">Hard tissue—which includes dentine, enamel and cementum</p></li>
<li><p class="">Soft tissue—which includes dentinal pulp and periodontal ligament.<a name="page108"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">108</span></span></p></li>
</ol>
<p class="noindent"><bold>Dentine:</bold> It is avascular and hard tissue forming the main bulk of the tooth. It surrounds the pulp cavity and the root canal. It is composed of organic and inorganic components similar to bone. It is formed by odontoblasts (mesodermal in origin) that line the pulp cavity and root canal (formation of dentine is continuous but slow process occurring throughout life). It presents dentinal tubules radiating from the pulp cavity and root canal containing the processes of odontoblasts.</p>
<p class="noindent"><bold>Enamel:</bold> It is avascular and hardest substance in the body which covers the dentine of crown. It is composed of inorganic salts. It is formed by ameloblasts (ectodermal in origin) that disappear after the tooth has erupted (so no capacity of regeneration). It presents enamel rods or prisms radiating from dentino-enamel junction towards the surface.</p>
<p class="noindent"><bold>Cementum:</bold> <bold>It</bold> is bone like tissue which covers the dentine of root. It is secreted by cementoblasts which later become cementocytes surrounded by their own secretion and found in lacunae. Cementum is laid continuously throughout life like dentine.</p>
<p class="noindent"><bold>Dentinal pulp:</bold> It is present in the pulp cavity and root canal. It is composed of loose areolar connective tissue containing neurovascular structures which enter through apical foramen at the tip of the root. It is covered externally by a layer of odontoblasts.</p>
<p class="noindent"><bold>Periodontal ligament:</bold> It fixes the root of tooth to alveolar socket. It is composed of dense fibrous connective tissue.</p>
</div>
</div><div class="section" id="ch12lev1sec2"><h1 class="title">LIPS</h1>
<p class="noindent">The upper and lower lips are fleshy mucocutaneous flaps forming the boundaries of oral fissure or orifice. Each lip is covered externally by dry hairy skin and internally by wet mucous membrane enclosing in the middle circularly arranged skeletal muscle orbicularis oris. The skin is lined by stratified squamous keratinized epithelium containing hair and glands. The mucous membrane is lined by stratified squamous non-keratinized epithelium which is very thick and indented by deep vascular papillae of lamina propria. The submucosa contains large labial glands which are predominantly mucous. Oral orifice is one of the mucocutaneous junctions of the body. It shows a transition of keratinized epidermis of skin to non-keratinized epithelium of labial mucosa. This transitory zone is called red line or vermilion border of the lip.</p>
</div><div class="section" id="ch12lev1sec3"><h1 class="title">SALIVARY GLANDS</h1>
<p class="noindent">Secrete saliva and are mainly present in three pairs: Parotid gland, submandibular gland and sublingual gland.</p>
<p class="indent">Apart from these major salivary glands, there are some minor salivary glands in oral mucosa which are named according to their situation, e.g., labial glands in lips, lingual glands in tongue, buccal glands in cheek and palatine glands in palate.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch12lev2sec2"><h2 class="title">Parotid Gland</h2>
<p class="noindent">It is compound alveolar and serous type. Acini are purely serous type and amongst them many ducts of varying caliber. The gland is infiltrated by adipocytes, encapsulated by a collagenous capsule sending septa to divide the gland into lobes and lobules. The main duct called Stenson's duct opens in the vestibule of mouth opposite the crown of upper 2nd molar tooth. This main duct divides into interlobar, interlobular and intralobular ducts. The ramifications of intralobular ducts are called striated and then intercalated ducts which open into acini. The lining epithelium of duct system is as follows:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Intercalated duct—simple cuboidal.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Striated and intralobular duct—simple columnar.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Interlobular, interlobar and terminal duct—stratified columnar. Terminal part of Stenson's duct—stratified squamous.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">Myoepithelial or Basket cells are fusiform cells with long cytoplasmic processes and situated around the acini. By their contractile nature they squeeze the acinar cells and help in expulsion of secretion of acini.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch12lev2sec3"><h2 class="title">Submandibular Gland</h2>
<p class="noindent">It is a compound tubuloalveolar and mixed or seromucous type gland. Acini are predominantly serous type. Some mucous acini present serous demilunes. Rest of the feature is same as that of the parotid gland. The main duct called Wharton's duct opens on the top of sublingual papilla in the floor of mouth cavity on either side of frenulum linguae.<a name="page109"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">109</span></span></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch12lev2sec4"><h2 class="title">Sublingual Gland</h2>
<p class="noindent">It is also a compound tubuloalveolar and mixed or seromucous type gland. Acini are predominantly mucous type. Number of serous demilunes is more. Rest of the feature is same as that of parotid gland. The gland is drained by many ducts called ducts of Rivinus which open directly on the surface of sublingual fold in the floor of mouth cavity. Some ducts may join Wharton's duct.</p>
<p class="noindent"><bold>Demilune of Heidenhain or crescent of Giannuzzi:</bold> When serous cells form a cap or crescent over the blind end of a mucous acinus, it is called a Demilune of Heidenhain or crescent of Giannuzzi or serous demilune.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch12lev2sec5"><h2 class="title">Tongue</h2>
<p class="noindent">It is a muscular organ made of skeletal muscles (intrinsic and extrinsic) covered by mucous membrane. It is divisible into two parts (1) oral/anterior 2/3 and (2) pharyngeal/posterior 1/3.</p>
<p class="indent">The <bold>mucous membrane</bold> consists of stratified squamous epithelium with keratinization at places especially at the tips of filiform and fungiform papillae and the underlying lamina propria.</p>
<p class="noindent">The lamina propria contains lingual glands which are of three types namely:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li><p class="">Anterior lingual glands/seromucous glands/glands of Nuhn which are present at the tip</p></li>
<li><p class="">Posterior lingual glands/mucous glands which are present at the posterior 1/3 and are related to lingual tonsil and</p></li>
<li><p class="">Serous glands/Von Ebner's glands and are close to circumvallate and foliate papillae.</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="noindent">The epithelium shows regional variations. The anterior 2/3rd of dorsal surface of tongue presents lingual papillae and posterior 1/3 presents lingual tonsils whereas ventral surface of tongue is smooth and featureless. On the dorsal surface a ‘V’ shaped sulcus terminal is with its apex directed posteriorly lies between anterior 2/3rd and posterior 1/3rd of tongue.</p>
<p class="noindent">Lingual papillae are the projections of epithelium containing subepithelial connective tissue or dermal core. They are of four types:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Filiform</span> are uniformly distributed on the anterior 2/3rd of the dorsum of tongue (numerous at the tip). They are conical in shape. Its epithelium is keratinized and no taste buds are present in it</p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Fungiform</span> are also distributed on the anterior 2/3rd of dorsum among filiform (mostly on the sides and tip). They are knob like with rounded top and narrow base. The epithelium is keratinized and few taste buds are present at the top</p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Circumvallate</span> are 10–12 in number arranged in V-shaped row in front of sulcus terminalis. Each papilla has a circular broad top and narrow base. It then sinks into the mucous membrane from which it is separated by a circular trench, the outer wall of which is known as the vallum. The epithelium is non-keratinized and numerous taste buds are present at the sides of the papillae and the vallum. Into the trench open the ducts of von Ebner's glands.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Foliate</span> are rudimentary in human being but well developed in rodents and present at the posterior part of lateral margin of tongue. They are cylindrical in shape and present taste buds at their sides.</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="indent">The taste buds are end organs or receptors for the taste sensation and present in the epithelium of fungiform, circumvallate and foliate papillae of tongue. Each taste bud is barrel shaped or oval body which extends through full thickness of the stratified squamous epithelium to open on the surface through a gustatory pore.</p>
<p class="noindent">There are three types of cells present in the taste bud:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Taste or gustatory cells</span> are lightly stained elongated cells having microvilli at the apical ends</p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Sustentacular or supportive cells</span> are darkly stained elongated cells having microvilli at the apical ends. They support the taste cells</p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Basal or stem cells</span> are small pyramidal cells lying close to basement membrane and do not reach the gustatory pore. They give rise to taste and sustentacular cells.</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="noindent"><bold>Muscles:</bold> Are skeletal type and include both extrinsic and intrinsic groups.</p>
<p class="noindent"><bold>Lymphoid tissue:</bold> Presents aggregated lymphatic nodules situated underneath the epithelium of the posterior 1/3rd of tongue and forms lingual tonsil, a part of Waldeyer's ring.</p>
<p class="noindent">(The four basic taste sensations are sour, bitter, sweet and salty. Each of them can be perceived maximum at certain regions of the tongue. For example, sweet at the tip, saline at the margin, sour over the dorsum and bitter over the posterior part of the tongue. However, there are no structural differences in the taste buds for various sensations.)<a name="page110"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">110</span></span></p>

<div class="section" id="ch12lev2sec6"><h2 class="title">General Plan of Gastrointestinal Tract</h2>
<p class="noindent">Basically, the alimentary canal has four coats in its wall:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p class=""><bold>Mucous coat:</bold> Presenting lining epithelium, lamina propria or subepithelial tissue containing glands and lymphoid accumulations and muscularis mucosa containing smooth muscle arranged in two layers, inner circular and outer longitudinal</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Submucous coat:</bold> Consists of fibro-areolar connective tissue and contains Meissner's plexus and may contain glands (esophagus and duodenum)</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Muscular coat:</bold> Consists of smooth muscle arranged in two layers, inner circular and outer longitudinal, and contains Auerbach's (Myenteric) plexus and parasympathetic ganglia between two layers.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Serous or adventitial coat:</bold> Consists of only loose connective tissue without peritoneum whereas serosa consists of loose connective tissue covered by surface layer of flattened mesothelial cells or peritoneum.</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="noindent">General structure of gastrointestinal tract from esophagus to anal canal is more or less same except some regional variations in the mucous coat.</p>
</div>
</div><div class="section" id="ch12lev1sec4"><h1 class="title">ESOPHAGUS</h1>
<p class="noindent">Four basic coats:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p class="">Mucosa: The lining epithelium is stratified squamous non-keratinized type. The lamina propria or subepithelial connective tissue contains compound branched tubular mucous glands in the lower part called esophageal cardiac glands. The muscularis mucosa consists of longitudinal layer of smooth muscle only (no circular layer).</p></li>
<li><p class="">The submucosa contains compound tubuloalveolar mucous glands called esophageal glands.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The muscularis externa presents usual two layers, outer longitudinal and inner circular but muscle type is characteristic. It is skeletal in upper 1/3rd, smooth in lower 1/3rd and mixed in the intermediate 1/3rd.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The adventitial coat is present except in the lower 1.25 cm where serosa is present instead.</p></li>

</ul>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">The mucous coat</span> The lining epithelium is simple columnar with goblet cells. The goblet cells are mucous secreting unicellular glands, which look empty because there contained mucigen is dissolved in histological processing. The number of these cells gradually increases from duodenum to ileum side. The epithelium and underlying lamina propria shows finger-like projections/evaginations called intestinal villi. The epithelium also shows tubular invaginations from the base of the villi in to the lamina propria called as crypts of Lieberkuhn or intestinal glands. These crypts are lined by columnar and goblet cells. Apart from these cells Paneth cells and Enteroendocrine/Enterochromaffin cells are found at the base. Paneth cells secrete lysozyme an antibacterial enzyme controlling the intestinal flora whereas Enteroendocrine cells secrete enteroglucagone, amines and serotonin. The crypts open at the base of villi in the intervillous space. Lamina propria is a connective tissue containing fibroblasts, mast cells, plasma cells, lymphocytes. Muscularis mucosa consists of usual two layers (outer longitudinal and inner circular) of smooth muscle.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">The submucous coat</span> shows regional variations e.g., Brunner's glands in duodenum, Peyer's patches in ileum and none of these in jejunum. (Brunner's glands are compound branched tubular mucous glands. Their ducts open into the crypts of Lieberkuhn. Mucous secretion protects the mucosa from auto digestion. Apart from mucous these glands also secrete a hormone urogastrone that inhibits HCl secretion in the stomach.)

<p class="noindent">Most of the surfaces are covered by the peritoneum or <bold>serous coat</bold> (single layer of flattened mesothelial cells). Subjacent to it is a connective tissue layer called <bold>Glisson's capsule</bold>. At the porta hepatis, this capsule sends trabeculae into the interior dividing the parenchyma into incomplete lobules. These trabeculae carry branches of hepatic artery, portal vein, bile duct and lymphatics and are called <bold>portal triad</bold>. The portal tracts are often referred to as <bold>portal triad</bold> because they always contain three structures namely a portal venule, a hepatic arteriole and a bile ductule.</p>
<p class="indent"><bold>A hepatic lobule</bold> is hexagonal or polygonal in shape and forms the structural unit of liver. It has a vein at the center called central vein. The liver cells or <bold>hepatocytes</bold> are arranged in one cell thick <bold>plates/laminae</bold> radiating from the central vein towards the periphery of the lobule. These <bold>hepatic plates</bold> branch and anastomose freely forming a complex labyrinthine and spongy structure called muralium. The irregular spaces between the hepatic plates are occupied by <bold>liver sinusoids</bold> lined by discontinuous fenestrated endothelial cells. Some of the endothelial cells are modified to become phagocytic cells called <bold>Kupffer's cells</bold> (a part of mononuclear phagocytic system). The sinusoids and hepatocytes are separated by a potential space called the <bold>perisinusoidal space of Disse.</bold></p>
<p class="indent">A hepatocyte is polyhedral in shape having 1 or 2 round euchromatic nuclei. The cytoplasm is acidophilic but contains basophilic granules. The surfaces of hepatocyte behave in different manners. Out of 6 or more surfaces of the hepatocyte at least two surfaces are in contact with sinusoidal wall through space of Disse and facilitate exchange of material between blood and hepatocyte. Some surfaces take part in the formation of bile canaliculi while some other surfaces may adhere through junctional complexes.</p>
<p class="indent">The bile canaliculi join together to form intralobular bile ductules (cholangioles) which drain into interlobular bile ductules in the portal tracts, which go on uniting and ultimately right and left hepatic ducts are formed, which unite to form common hepatic duct and finally bile duct or common bile duct is formed after joining with the cystic duct.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch12lev2sec10"><h2 class="title">Hepatic Circulation</h2>
<p class="noindent">The sinusoids are irrigated by the venous blood from portal vein and arterial blood from hepatic artery through their interlobular branches. The blood then flows towards central veins then into sublobular veins and then to the hepatic veins.<a name="page113"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">113</span></span></p>
<p class="indent">A portal lobule is the functional unit of liver consisting of parenchyma which drains bile into the hepatic ductule of portal triad. It is triangular in shape and can be visualized by drawing imaginary lines joining the central veins of three adjacent hepatic lobules.</p>
<p class="indent">A hepatic acinus is another functional unit of liver consisting of parenchyma which is irrigated by the terminal branches of portal vein and hepatic artery. It is diamond shaped and includes adjacent areas of two hepatic lobules between the central veins.</p>
<p class="indent">(Liver has a remarkable regeneration capacity so transplantation of part of it is possible. When there is repeated damage to hepatocytes in some condition like alcoholism, hepatocytes proliferate in a disorganized manner forming nodular masses with increased amount of connective tissue and this condition is called <bold>cirrhosis</bold> of liver).</p>

<p class="noindent">It is an exocrine and an endocrine gland both.</p>
<p class="noindent"><bold>Exocrine part</bold> is formed by serous acini arranged in lobules. The lobules are separated by interlobular septae of connective tissue carrying neurovascular structures and ducts. Each acinus is made up of pyramidal serous cells surrounding a lumen. The cells are darkly stained at the bases and lightly stained at the apex containing zymogen granules. Some of the acini exhibit pale staining centroacinar cells within the lumen, which are cuboidal and represent the invaginated intra-acinar part of intercalated duct. The intercalated ducts drain into intralobular ducts which in turn drain into interlobular ducts and are lined by simple to stratified cuboidal epithelium. The interlobular ducts empty into the main pancreatic duct.</p>
<p class="noindent"><bold>Endocrine part</bold> of pancreas is formed by islets of Langerhans, which are pale staining oval or spherical bodies among the serous acini. They are more in the tail of pancreas and made up of branching cords of four types of endocrine cells supported by the reticular fibers and a network of capillaries:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li><p class="">Alpha cells—About 20% of islet cells, large cells with acidophilic granules, found at the periphery of islet and secrete glucagon that increases glucose level in the blood.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Beta cells—About 70% of islet cells, small cells with basophilic granules, found mostly at the center of islet and secrete insulin that decreases glucose level in the blood.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Delta cells—about 5% of islet cells, indifferent in staining but stainable with silver stain and secrete somatostatin that inhibits secretion of GH, glucagon, insulin, pancreatic juice and bile.</p></li>
<li><p class="">‘F’ cells—secrete pancreatic polypeptides that inhibit pancreatic secretion.</p></li>

<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Xerostomia</bold> or dry mouth is a common condition associated with difficulties in chewing, swallowing, tasting, and speaking, dental caries, and atrophy of the oral mucosa. The most common causes are the use of certain systemic medications (mostly in the elderly), high doses of radiation, and certain diseases such as Sjogren's syndrome. This syndrome is a chronic autoimmune disorder characterized by lymphocytic infiltration of the exocrine glands, particularly the salivary and lacrimal glands. Clinical features may involve the skin, eyes, oral cavity, and salivary glands, as well as the nervous, musculoskeletal, genitourinary, and vascular systems.</p></li>
<li><p class="">In <bold>Acute Necrotizing Pancreatitis</bold>, the proenzymes may be activated and digest the whole pancreas, leading to very serious complications. Possible causes are alcoholism, gallstones, metabolic factors, trauma, infection, and drugs.</p></li>
<li><p class="">In conditions of extreme malnutrition such as <bold>kwashiorkor,</bold> pancreatic acinar cells and other active protein-secreting cells atrophy and lose much of their rough endoplasmic reticulum. The production of digestive enzymes is also hindered.</p></li>
<li><p class="">In chronically diseased liver, Ito's cells are activated by factors released by hepatocytes and Kupffer cells, proliferate, and acquire the features of myofibroblasts, with or without the lipid droplets. Under these conditions, these cells are found close to the damaged hepatocytes and play a major role in the development of fibrosis, including the fibrosis secondary to alcoholic liver disease. This fibrosis may become irreversible, leading to cirrhosis.</p></li>
<li><p class="">One of the main processes occurring in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum is the conjugation of hydrophobic (water-insoluble) toxic bilirubin by glucuronyl transferase to form a water-soluble nontoxic bilirubin glucuronide. This conjugate is excreted by hepatocytes into the bile. When bilirubin or bilirubin glucuronide is not excreted, various diseases characterized by jaundice (the presence of bile pigments in blood) can result.</p></li>
<li><p class="">One of the frequent causes of jaundice in newborns is the often underdeveloped state of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum in their hepatocytes (<bold>neonatal hyperbilirubinemia</bold>). The current treatment for these cases is exposure to blue light from ordinary fluorescent tubes, which transforms unconjugated bilirubin into a water-soluble photoisomer that can be excreted by the kidneys.</p></li>
<li><p class="">A variety of rare inherited disorders of peroxisome function occur in humans, most involving mutations of the enzymes found within peroxisomes. For example, X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) results from a failure to metabolize fatty acids properly, resulting in the deterioration of the myelin sheaths of neurons. An attempt to find an effective treatment was the subject of the 1992 film Lorenzo's Oil.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Commonly used liver function tests are measurements of the serum bilirubin level (a measure of hepatic conjugation and excretion) and of albumin and prothrombin time (measures of protein synthesis). Abnormalities in these tests are typical of hepatic disfunction.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The administration of barbiturates to laboratory animals results in rapid development of smooth endoplasmic reticulum in hepatocytes. Barbiturates can also increase synthesis of glucuronyl transferase. This finding has led to the use of barbiturates in the treatment of glucuronyl transferase deficiencies.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The administration of barbiturates to laboratory animals results in rapid development of smooth endoplasmic reticulum in hepatocytes. Barbiturates can also increase synthesis of glucuronyl transferase. This finding has led to the use of barbiturates in the treatment of glucuronyl transferase deficiencies.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Gallstones (cholelithiasis)</bold> are formed by the concretion of normal and abnormal bile constituents. Cholesterol and mixed stones comprise 80% of the gallstones, which are frequently caused by excessive cholesterol in relation to phospholipids and bile acids or gallbladder hypomotility. Gallstones can block bile flow and cause jaundice from the rupture of tight junctions around the bile canaliculi.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Tumors of the digestive glands:</bold> Most malignant tumors of the liver derive from hepatic parenchyma or epithelial cells of the bile duct. The pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma is not completely understood, but it may be associated with a variety of acquired disorders, such as chronic viral hepatitis (B or C) and cirrhosis. In the exocrine pancreas, most tumors arise from ductal epithelial cells; the mortality rate from pancreatic tumors is high.</p></li>
<li><p class="">In certain diseases, such as <bold>Hirschsprung disease</bold> (congenital megacolon) or <bold>Chagas’ disease</bold> (<span class="italic">Trypanosoma cruzi</span> infection), the plexuses in the digestive tract are severely injured and most of their neurons are destroyed. This results in disturbances of digestive tract motility, with frequent dilatations in some areas. The abundant innervation from the autonomic nervous system that the digestive tract receives provides an anatomic explanation of the widely observed action of emotional stress on the digestive tract—a phenomenon of importance in psychosomatic medicine.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Unlike bone, dentin persists as a mineralized tissue long after destruction of the odontoblasts. It is therefore possible to maintain teeth whose pulp and odontoblasts have been destroyed by infection (canal treatment). In adult teeth, destruction of the covering enamel by erosion from use or dental caries (tooth decay) usually triggers a reaction in odontoblasts that causes them to resume the synthesis of dentin components.<a name="page130"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">130</span></span></p></li>
<li><p class="">The susceptibility of enamel crystals to dissolution in acidic pH is the basis for dental caries, and some of these crystals (fluorapatite, for example) are less susceptible than hydroxyapatite.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Compared with bone, the cementum has lower metabolic activity because it is not irrigated by blood vessels. This feature allows the movement of teeth by orthodontic appliances without significant root resorption.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The high rate of collagen renewal in the periodontal ligament allows processes affecting protein or collagen synthesis, e.g., protein or vitamin C deficiency (<bold>scurvy</bold>), to cause atrophy of this ligament. As a consequence, teeth become loose in their sockets; in extreme cases they fall out. This relative plasticity of the periodontal ligament is important because it allows orthodontic intervention, which can produce extensive changes in the disposition of teeth in the mouth.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The depth of the gingival sulcus, measured during clinical examination, is very important and may indicate periodontal disease.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Gastresophageal reflux disease</bold> is associated with incompetent barriers at the gastresophageal junction, caused by a decrease in the lower esophageal sphincter tone or hiatus hernia. Reflux esophagitis (from mild to erosive) develops when the mucosal defenses are not sufficient to protect the esophageal mucosa from the acid, pepsin, and bile, causing symptoms such as heartburn or atypical chest pain. Excessive gastric distention, fatty meals, smoking, and beverages such as tea and coffee (with high xanthine content) also cause relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter, facilitating the reflux of gastric contents to the esophagus.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Stress and other psychosomatic factors; ingested substances such as aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or ethanol; the hyperosmolality of meals; and some microorganisms (e.g., <span class="italic">Helicobacter pylori</span>) can disrupt this epithelial layer and lead to ulceration. An ulcer is a disruption of the mucosal integrity that leads to an excavation due to active inflammation. The initial ulceration may heal, or it may be further aggravated by the local aggressive agents, leading to additional gastric and duodenal ulcers. Processes that enable the gastric mucosa to rapidly repair superficial damage incurred by several factors play a very important role in the defense mechanism, as does an adequate blood flow that supports gastric physiological activity. Any imbalance between aggression and protection may lead to pathological alterations. As an example, aspirin and ethanol irritate the mucosa partly by reducing mucosal blood flow. Several anti-inflammatory drugs inhibit the production of prostaglandins of the E type, which are very important substances for the alkalinization of the mucous layer and, consequently, are important for protection.</p></li>
<li><p class="">In cases of atrophic gastritis, both parietal and chief cells are much less numerous, and the gastric juice has little or no acid or pepsin activity. In humans, oxyntic cells are the site of production of <bold>intrinsic factor,</bold> a glycoprotein that binds avidly to vitamin B<sub>12</sub>. In other species, however, the intrinsic factor may be produced by other cells.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The complex of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> with intrinsic factor is absorbed by pinocytosis into the cells in the ileum; this explains why a lack of intrinsic factor can lead to vitamin B<sub>12</sub> deficiency. This condition results in a disorder of the erythrocyte-forming mechanism known as <bold>pernicious anemia,</bold> usually caused by <bold>atrophic gastritis.</bold> In a certain percentage of cases, pernicious anemia seems to be an autoimmune disease, because antibodies against parietal cell proteins are often detected in the blood of patients with the disease.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Tumors called <bold>carcinoids,</bold> which arise from these cells, are responsible for the clinical symptoms caused by overproduction of serotonin. Serotonin increases gut motility, but high levels of this hormone/neurotransmitter have been related to mucosal vasoconstriction and damage.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Deficiencies of disaccharidases have been described in human diseases characterized by digestive disturbances. Some of the enzymatic deficiencies seem to be of genetic origin.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The absorption of nutrients is also greatly hindered in disorders marked by atrophy of the intestinal mucosa caused by infections or nutritional deficiencies, producing the <bold>malabsorption syndrome</bold>.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Because the appendix is closed ended, it has a very small volume capacity and frequently becomes a site of inflammation <bold>(appendicitis).</bold> Frequent causes of appendicitis are luminal obstruction (by a fecalith, enlarged lymphoid follicles associated with viral infection, tumors, worms) and ulceration of the mucosa. The inflammation can progress to the point of perforation of this structure, with consequent infection of the peritoneal cavity.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Approximately 90–95% of malignant tumors of the digestive system are derived from intestinal or gastric epithelial cells. Malignant tumors of the large bowel are derived almost exclusively from its glandular epithelium <bold>(adenocarcinomas)</bold> and are the second most common cause of cancer deaths in the United States. Some proteins such as the carcinoembryonic antigen produced exclusively by malign cells are very important for the diagnosis of cancer.</p></li>
