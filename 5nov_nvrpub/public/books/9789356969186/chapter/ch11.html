<div class="sidebar">
<p class="">Nasal cavity, pharynx, larynx, trachea, bronchial tree and lungs.</p>
</div>
<p class="noindent">Trachea divides into right and left primary or principal bronchi, which pass into the corresponding lungs. Right bronchus divides into three and left into two secondary or lobar bronchi. Each secondary bronchus divides into tertiary or segmental bronchi according to the number of bronchopulmonary segments in that lobe. The tertiary bronchi divide and redivide repeatedly and when their diameter becomes 1 mm or less they are called bronchioles. They also divide repeatedly and when their diameter becomes 0.5 mm they are called terminal bronchioles. Here conducting part ends and respiratory part begins. Each terminal bronchiole gives off two or more respiratory bronchioles. Each respiratory bronchiole divides into a number of alveolar ducts. An alveolar duct leads into several alveolar sacs through atria. The walls of the respiratory bronchioles, alveolar ducts, atria and alveolar sacs are studded with a number of extremely thin walled outpouchings called alveoli.</p>

<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Immotile cilia syndrome,</bold> a disorder that causes infertility in men and chronic respiratory tract infections in both sexes, is caused by immobility of cilia and flagella induced, in some cases, by deficiency of <bold>dynein,</bold> a protein normally present in the cilia. Dynein participates in the ciliary movement.</p></li>
<li><p class="">From the nasal cavity through the larynx, portions of the epithelium are stratified squamous. This type of epithelium is evident in regions exposed to direct airflow or physical abrasion (e.g., oropharynx, epiglottis, vocal folds); it provides more protection from attrition than does typical respiratory epithelium. If airflow currents are altered or new abrasive sites develop, the affected areas can convert from typical ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelium to stratified squamous epithelium. Similarly, in smokers, the proportion of ciliated cells to goblet cells is altered to aid in clearing the increased particulate and gaseous pollutants (e.g., CO, SO<sub>2</sub>). Although the greater numbers of goblet cells in a smoker's epithelium provide for a more rapid clearance of pollutants, the reduction in ciliated cells caused by excessive intake of CO results in decreased movement of the mucous layer and frequently leads to congestion of the smaller airways.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Allergic reactions and inflammation can cause abnormal engorgement of swell bodies in both fossae, severely restricting the air flow.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Sinusitis</bold> is an inflammatory process of the sinuses that may persist for long periods of time, mainly because of obstruction of drainage orifices. Chronic sinusitis and bronchitis are components of immotile cilia syndrome, which is characterized by defective ciliary action.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The increase in bronchiole diameter in response to stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system explains why epinephrine and other sympathomimetic drugs are frequently used to relax smooth muscle during asthma attacks. When the thickness of the bronchial walls is compared with that of the bronchiolar walls, it can be seen that the bronchiolar muscle layer is more developed. Increased airway resistance in asthma is believed to be due mainly to contraction of bronchiolar smooth muscle.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The <bold>respiratory distress syndrome</bold> of the newborn is a life-threatening disorder of the lungs caused by a deficiency of surfactant. It is principally associated with prematurity and is the leading cause of mortality among premature infants. The incidence of respiratory distress syndrome varies inversely with gestation age. The immature lung is deficient in both the amount and composition of surfactant. In the normal newborn, the onset of breathing is associated with a massive release of stored surfactant, which reduces the surface tension of the alveolar cells. This means that less inspiratory force is needed to inflate the alveoli, and thus the work of breathing is reduced. In the respiratory distress syndrome the alveoli are collapsed, and the respiratory bronchioles and alveolar ducts are dilated and contain edema fluid. A fibrin-rich eosinophilic material called hyaline membrane lines the alveolar ducts. This explains why respiratory distress syndrome was initially named hyaline membrane disease. Fortunately, synthesis of surfactant can be induced by administration of glucocorticoids, a medication used in cases of respiratory distress syndrome. Recently, surfactant has also been suggested to have a bactericidal effect, aiding in the removal of potentially dangerous bacteria that reach the alveoli.</p></li>
<li><p class="">In congestive heart failure, the lungs become congested with blood, and erythrocytes pass into the alveoli, where they are phagocytosed by alveolar macrophages. In such cases, these macrophages are called <bold>heart failure cells</bold> when present in the lung and sputum; they are identified by a positive histochemical reaction for iron pigment (hemosiderin).</p></li>
<li><p class="">Increased production of collagen is common, and many diseases that lead to respiratory distress are known to be associated with lung fibrosis. In these pathological conditions the collagen present is type I.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Emphysema</bold> is a chronic lung disease characterized by enlargement of the air space distal to the bronchioles, with destruction of the interalveolar wall. Emphysema usually develops gradually and results in respiratory insufficiency. The major cause of emphysema is cigarette smoking. Even moderate emphysema is rare in nonsmokers. Probably irritation produced by cigarette smoking stimulates the destruction, or impairs the synthesis, of elastic fibers and other components of the interalveolar septum.<a name="page106"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">106</span></span></p></li>
<li><p class="">The respiratory system has an exceptionally large area that is exposed to both blood-borne microorganisms and the external environment. Because it is consequently very susceptible to the invasion of airborne infective and irritating noninfective agents, it is not surprising that the respiratory system presents an elaborate array of defense mechanisms. The cough reflex can eliminate these particles by expectoration or swallowing. Smaller particles are removed by alveolar macrophages. In addition to these nonspecific mechanisms, elaborate immunological processes occur in abundant lymphoid tissues of the bronchus, mainly in nodules containing T and B lymphocytes that interact with lung macrophages. This important component of the immune system is called <bold>BALT</bold> (bronchus-associated lymphatic tissue).</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Tumors of the lung:</bold> The incidence of lung tumors is higher in men but is increasing in women, probably because of cigarette smoking. There is conclusive evidence that squamous cell carcinoma, the principal lung tumor type, is related to the effects of cigarette smoking on the bronchial and bronchiolar epithelial lining. Chronic smoking induces the transformation of the respiratory epithelium into a stratified squamous epithelium, an initial step in its eventual differentiation into a tumor.</p></li>
