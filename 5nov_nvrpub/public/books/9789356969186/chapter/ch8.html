<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Lymphatic vessels or lymphatics</p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Lymphoid tissues</span> including primary or central lymphoid tissue, i.e., bone marrow and thymus and secondary or peripheral lymphoid tissue comprises lymph nodes, spleen and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (lymphatic nodules of digestive, respiratory, urinary and integumentary system)</p></li>

<p class="noindent">Lymphoid tissues are broadly classified as:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p class=""><bold>Diffuse Lymphoid Tissue:</bold> Forming a layer of diffusely arranged lymphocytes and plasma cells in the lamina propria deep to epithelium of digestive, respiratory and urogenital tracts (forming second line of defense of body against invasion of microorganism</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Dense Lymphoid Tissue:</bold> Forming nodules by collection of large number of lymphocytes. It is subclassified as
<ul style="list-style-type: dash">
<li><p class="">MALT, i.e., Mucosa associated lymphoid tissues/non-capsulated lymphoid tissues, e.g., Solitary nodules, aggregated nodules (Payer’ patches), nodules in vermiform appendix and Waldeyer's lymphoid ring at the entrance of pharynx</p></li>
<li><p class="">DLO, i.e., discrete lymphoid organs/encapsulated lymphoid organs, e.g., Thymus, lymph nodes, spleen, palatine tonsil and part of MALT<a name="page73"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">73</span></span></p></li></ul></p></li>
</ol>
<p class="noindent"><bold>Functions</bold></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p class="">Phagocytosis and specific immune response</p></li>
<li><p class="">Drainage of tissue fluid with coarse particles</p></li>
<li><p class="">Contribution to cell population of blood and lymph.</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="noindent"><bold>Structure</bold></p>
<p class="noindent">General architecture of lymphoid organs presents:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li><p class="">A connective tissue framework</p></li>
<li><p class="">Parenchyma of lymphoid tissue</p></li>
</ol>
<div class="section" id="ch8lev2sec1"><h2 class="title">Lymph Nodes</h2>
<p class="noindent">Microscopically, it has:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Connective tissue framework forming <bold>capsule, trabeculae and reticular stroma</bold>.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Parenchyma</bold> of lymphoid tissue forming cortex, paracortex and medulla.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Capsule</bold> is formed by collagen and elastic fibers. It sends trabeculae into the interior.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">Beneath the capsule is subcapsular sinus which is traversed by reticular fibers and cells and is continuous with trabecular sinuses around trabeculae. The trabecular sinuses are continuous with medullary sinuses. In the midst of coarse framework of trabeculae lies a fine meshwork of reticular stroma made up of reticular fibers and associated phagocytic reticular cells.</p>
<p class="noindent">Parenchyma consists of lymphocytes (large, medium and small), plasma cells and macrophages.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Cortex</bold> presents lymphatic nodules. A lymphatic nodule with a pale germinal center is called secondary nodule whereas one without germinal center is called primary nodule. The germinal center contains large lymphoblasts with pale nuclei</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Paracortex</bold> or innercortex contains T lymphocytes and is called thymus dependent zone. Normally no nodules are present but sometimes discrete nodules are seen.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Medulla</bold> presents medullary cords and medullary sinuses. Medullary cords branch and anastomose and are made up of mainly B lymphocytes. Medullary sinuses drain into the efferent lymphatics.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch8lev2sec2"><h2 class="title">Spleen</h2>
<p class="noindent">Microscopic features:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Connective tissue</bold> framework forming capsule, trabeculae and reticular stroma</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Capsule</bold> is formed by collagenous tissue and few smooth muscle cells and covered by serous coat or peritoneum. It sends trabeculae into the interior which carry blood vessels. In the midst of coarse framework of trabeculae lies a fine meshwork of reticular stroma made up of reticular fibers and associated phagocytic reticular cells.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Parenchyma</bold> of lymphoid tissue forming <bold>white</bold> (grey) pulp and <bold>red</bold> pulp.</p>
<p class="">Parenchyma presents white or grey rounded areas called white pulp and surrounding red matrix is called red pulp. White pulp has a central arteriole ensheathed by a periarterial lymphatic sheath. Along the white pulp there are large collections of lymphocytes forming lymphatic nodules. The lymphatic nodules are surrounded by an active zone containing many macrophages, few T lymphocytes and blood sinuses. This functional zone between white and red pulp is called marginal zone. Red pulp is a modified lymphoid tissue infiltrated with blood cells. It has irregular anastomosing splenic cords of Billroth and large splenic venous sinuses or sinusoids.</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="ch8lev3sec1"><h3 class="title">Splenic Circulation</h3>
<p class="noindent">Splenic artery (a branch of coeliac trunk) leads to formation of trabecular arteries and arterioles. It leaves adventitial coat and becomes surrounded by lymphoid tissue sheath forming white pulp. The site of maximum concentration of lymphocytes is called Malpighian body or splenic lymphoid follicle. The arteriole loses its sheath and divides into 5–6 branches called penicillar arteries. Each penicillar artery has three parts: (i) artery of the pulp, (ii) sheathed artery and (iii) capillary. Artery of the pulp has only one layer of smooth muscle cells in its tunica media. The sheathed artery loses its tunica media which is replaced by concentrically arranged reticular cells and macrophages. The capillary ending is uncertain, there are three theories to explain its termination: (i) closed theory states it ends into the splenic venous sinus or sinusoid, (ii) open theory states it opens into cords of <bold>Billroth</bold> and from there blood passes into sinusoids, (iii) compromise theory states that splenic circulation is closed in contracted spleen and open in distended spleen.<a name="page74"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">74</span></span></p>

<div class="section" id="ch8lev2sec3"><h2 class="title">Thymus</h2>
<p class="noindent">Microscopic feature presents</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Connective tissue framework forming <bold>capsule, interlobular septa</bold> and cellular cytoplasmic <bold>reticulum</bold><bold>.</bold></p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Parenchyma</bold> of lymphoid tissue forming cortex, medulla and <bold>Hassall's corpuscles</bold>.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Capsule</bold> is thin and it sends interlobular septa in to the interior to divide lobes into incomplete lobules.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">In the coarse framework of interlobular septa lies a fine meshwork of cellular cytoplasmic reticulum formed by the epithelial reticular cells. This reticulum is different from the reticulum of other lymphoid organs where it is formed by reticular fibers. Thymic reticular cells are not a part of reticuloendothelial system.</p>
<p class="indent">Each lobule has a peripheral dark staining <bold>cortex</bold> and central light staining <bold>medulla</bold>. Outer cortex contains larger lymphocytes (lymphoblasts) which form smaller lymphocytes by mitosis and push them in to the inner cortex. Medulla of one lobule is continuous with medulla of neighboring lobules. Medulla is light stained because lymphocytes are loosely packed here.</p>
<p class="indent">The most characteristic feature of medulla is the presence of Hassall's corpuscles which are round eosinophilic bodies having a central homogenous hyaline material surrounded by concentric layers of reticular cells. The number of Hassall's corpuscles increases with age and may show traces of calcification.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch8lev2sec4"><h2 class="title">Palatine Tonsil</h2>
<p class="noindent">Microscopically, it is surrounded on all sides by connective tissue capsule except the oral surface.</p>
<p class="indent">The oral surface is lined by the <bold>non-keratinized stratified squamous epithelium</bold>. The epithelium sends evaginations in the subepithelial tissue called <bold>tonsillar crypts</bold>. There are subepithelial lymphatic nodules in the lamina propria which may show germinal centers. Lymphocytes migrate through the epithelium form salivary corpuscles with desquamating epithelial cells. The deeper part of tonsil contains mucous glands; their ducts open into the bottom of crypts.<a name="page75"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">75</span></span></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch8lev2sec5"><h2 class="title">Lymph Node</h2>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="">Capsule, trabeculae and reticular stroma. Parenchyma of lymphoid tissue presents cortex, paracortex and medulla. Cortex presents lymphatic nodules. A lymphatic nodule with germinal center is called secondary nodule whereas without germinal center it is primary nodule. Medulla presents medullary cords and medullary sinuses.</p>

<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Diseases of the Immune System</bold></p>
<p class="">The diseases of immune system can be broadly grouped into three types:
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p class="">Some individuals develop abnormal and intense reactions in an attempt to neutralize the effects of some antigens. This exaggerated intolerance produces the numerous processes called <bold>allergic reactions</bold>.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The immune response can be impaired, a condition generally called <bold>immunodeficiency</bold>; this may have several causes, such as genetic or infectious (e.g., by measles and human immunodeficiency virus). Immunodeficiencies of genetic origin may be caused by mutations or deletions in genes that codify for molecules that participate in effector immune mechanisms or that are involved in the differentiation of T, B, and antigen presenting cell populations.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Autoimmune diseases are caused by T or B cell responses directed to self molecules. Tissues are affected or even destroyed by cytotoxic T lymphocytes or by autoantibodies.</p></li></ol></p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Infection and antigenic stimulation</bold> often cause satellite lymph nodes to enlarge. These swollen and painful nodules, which may be palpated under the skin, signal an inflammation. Inflamed nodules have multiple germinal centers with active cell proliferation. Although plasma cells constitute only 1–3% of the cell population in resting nodes, their numbers increase greatly in stimulated lymph nodes.</p></li>
<li><p class="">In certain pathological conditions (e.g., leukemia), the spleen may reinitiate the production of granulocytes and erythrocytes, a function present during fetal life, and undergo a process known as <bold>myeloid metaplasia</bold> (the occurrence of myeloid tissues in extramedullary sites).</p></li>
<li><p class="">Although the spleen has numerous important functions in the body, it is not essential to life. In some situations, the spleen must be removed (e.g., an abdominal injury that results in rupture of the spleen capsule, certain anemias, and platelet disorders). In this case other organs (e.g., the liver) take over some of the functions of the spleen. The risk of infection may be higher in a splenectomized individual.</p></li>
