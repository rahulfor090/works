<p class="">At the end of this chapter, the students will be able to:</p>
<p class=""><ul style="list-style-type: square">
<li><p class="">Identify the structure of all organs of urinary system in the slides under the microscope.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Correlate the structure of the organs of urinary system with their functions.</p></li>
</ul></p>
</div><p class="noindent">It consists of a pair of kidneys, a pair of ureters, urinary bladder and urethra.</p><div class="section" id="ch13lev1sec1"><h1 class="title">KIDNEY</h1>
<p class="noindent">A vertical section of a kidney presents a medial indentation called hilum, which transmits renal vessels, nerves and pelvis of ureter. The hilum leads to a space called renal sinus where the pelvis of ureter divides into 2–3 major calyces then 8–12 minor calyces</p>
<p class="indent">The substance of the kidney is divisible into an outer dark zone, cortex and an inner pale zone medulla. The medulla forms 8–12 renal pyramids, the bases of which face the cortex whereas their apices or renal papillae face the renal sinus, where they are cupped by the minor calyces. The tip of each renal papilla is pierced by many papillary ducts/ducts of Bellini opening into the minor calyx. From the bases of renal pyramids medullary tissue extends into the cortex as medullary rays. Similarly, cortical tissue extends between adjacent renal pyramids as renal column of Bertin. A renal pyramid with its overlying cortex is referred to as a renal lobe whereas a medullary ray and it surrounding cortical tissue is referred to as a renal lobule.</p>
<p class="indent">Microscopically, the kidney is composed of many compactly packed uriniferous or renal tubules embedded in a vascular interstitium. Each uriniferous tubule consists of two parts:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p class="">Nephron</p></li>
<li><p class="">Collecting tubule</p></li>
</ol>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p class=""><bold>Nephron</bold> is the structural and functional unit of kidney and there are about 1–4 million in each kidney. It consists of four parts:
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li><p class="">Renal corpuscle</p></li>
<li><p class="">Proximal convoluted tubule/Loop of Henle</p></li>
<li><p class="">Distal convoluted tubule</p></li>
<li><p class="">DCT.<a name="page132"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">132</span></span></p></li></ol>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Renal/Malpighian corpuscle</span> is responsible for the filtration of blood and present in the cortex. It has two components Bowman's capsule and Glomerulus. The Bowman's capsule is cup shaped structure having an outer parietal and an inner visceral layer separated by a space the Bowman's space. The parietal layer has simple squamous epithelium called capsular epithelium. The visceral layer invests the glomerulus and called glomerular epithelium having specialized epithelial cells called podocytes. The Glomerulus is a tuft of anastomosing network of capillaries supplied by an afferent arteriole and drained by an efferent arteriole. The capillaries are lined by fenestrated endothelium. The renal corpuscle has a vascular pole through which the afferent and the efferent arterioles enter and leave and a urinary pole from which PCT arises.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">PCT</span> starts at urinary pole of renal corpuscle and forms the bulk of cortex. It is longer and more convoluted than DCT. It is lined by simple cuboidal epithelium. The cells have microvilli or brush border appearance at luminal surface.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Loop of Henle</span> arises from the PCT in the cortex and dips down into the medulla as descending limb, then loops back as ascending limb and becomes continuous with the DCT at corticomedullary junction. The descending limb has a short thick segment and a long thin segment whereas the ascending limb has a short thin segment and a long thick segment. The thin segments of loop of Henle are lined by simple squamous epithelium.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">DCT</span> is shorter and less convoluted than the PCT and is found in the cortex. It is lined by simple cuboidal epithelium. The cells have no microvilli or brush border appearance.</p></li></ol></p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Collecting tubule and collecting duct:</bold> Collecting tubule begins in the medullary ray as continuation of DCT. As it enters the medulla it is joined by several other collecting tubules to form a larger collecting duct called duct of Bellini or papillary duct which opens at the apex of pyramid or renal papilla. The collecting tubules are lined by simple cuboidal epithelium whereas papillary ducts are by simple columnar epithelium.</p>
<p class="">The outer zone of medulla contains thick segments of loop of Henle, collecting tubules and collecting ducts whereas its inner zone contains thin segments of loops of Henle and vasa recti.</p></li>
</ol>
<div class="section" id="ch13lev2sec1"><h2 class="title">Juxta Glomerular Apparatus (JGA)</h2>
<p class="noindent">It is involved in regulation of blood pressure and made of three components:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Juxta glomerular/JG cells:</span> These are modified smooth muscle cells in the tunica media of afferent arteriole at the point of contact with DCT. They contain enzyme renin. The part of internal elastic lamina disappears close to these cells.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Macula densa which is a specialized region in the wall of DCT at the point of contact with afferent arteriole. Here lining epithelial cells are modified.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Lacis (network)/Polkissen cells:</span> These are extraglomerular mesangial cells at the vascular pole of renal corpuscle, close to macula densa. Their functions are not fully understood. They may be involved in production of hormone erythropoietin, which promotes erythropoiesis in bone marrow.</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch13lev2sec2"><h2 class="title">Renal Circulation</h2>
<p class="noindent">The renal artery forms segmental arteries in the renal sinus which forms interlobar arteries between the pyramids. Each of them bifurcates into Arcuate arteries at the base of pyramid in the corticomedullary junction. Interlobular arteries are at right angle between renal lobules and form afferent arterioles and capillaries of glomerulus. Efferent arterioles of cortical nephrons branch and form peritubular capillary plexus around convoluted tubules whereas efferent arterioles of juxta medullary nephrons give long thin capillary vessels called vasa recti which pass in the medulla and loop back towards corticomedullary junction—these vessels join to form Stellate veins in the cortex which forms interlobar veins which join to form Renal vein.</p>

<p class="noindent">Microscopically the wall of ureter is made of three coats from within outside:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Mucosa</span>—consists of transitional epithelium and lamina propria rich in elastic fibers. It shows longitudinal folds giving a star shaped appearance to the lumen.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Muscle coat</span>—consists of smooth muscle fibers arranged in two layers in upper 2/3rd of ureter, an inner longitudinal and an outer circular (opposite to arrangement of GIT). An additional outer longitudinal layer is added in the lower 1/3rd of ureter.</p></li>

<p class="noindent">Microscopically the wall of urinary bladder has three coats from within outside:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Mucosa</span>—consists of transitional epithelium and lamina propria. In empty bladder it exhibits folds and epithelium shows 5–6 cell layers. Some cells are binucleated. The plasma membrane of surface cells of epithelium is specially thickened to form an osmotic barrier between the toxic urine and tissue fluid.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Muscle coat</span>—consists of smooth muscle fibers arranged in three layers, inner longitudinal, middle circular and outer longitudinal.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Adventitia</span>—consists of fibroelastic connective tissue carrying blood vessels, lymphatics and nerves.

<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">In diseases such as diabetes mellitus and glomerulonephritis, the glomerular filter is altered and becomes much more permeable to proteins, with the subsequent release of protein into the urine (<bold>proteinuria</bold>).</p></li>
<li><p class="">After a significant hemorrhage (decreased blood volume promotes a decreased blood pressure), there is an increase in renin secretion. Angiotensin II is produced, enhancing blood pressure by both constricting arterioles and stimulating the secretion of the adrenocortical hormone <bold>aldosterone.</bold> Aldosterone acts on cells of the renal tubules (mostly the distal tubules) to increase the absorption of sodium and chloride ions from the glomerular filtrate. This increase in sodium and chloride ions, in turn, expands the fluid volume (particularly blood plasma volume), leading to an increase in blood pressure due to increased blood volume.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Decreased blood pressure caused by other factors (e.g., sodium depletion, dehydration) that decrease blood volume also activates the renin, angiotensin II, aldosterone mechanism that contributes to the maintenance of blood pressure.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Aldosterone deficiency in adrenalectomized animals and in humans with <bold>Addison disease</bold> results in an excessive loss of sodium in the urine.</p></li>
