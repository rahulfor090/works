<p class="noindent">It is a firm and flexible type of scleral connective tissue in which matrix has a firm consistency. Cartilage supports the surrounding tissues, provides gliding movement and growth to the long bones (hyaline cartilage). It is avascular (no blood and lymphatic) structure and nourished by the diffusion. There are no nerves in the cartilage so it is insensitive. It is covered by a dense connective tissue sheath called perichondrium except over articular and fibrocartilages.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Perichondrium has two layers, outer <bold>fibrous</bold> layer (vascular) and inner <bold>cellular</bold> layer of fibroblasts (chondrogenic).</p></li>
<li><p class="">Growth of the cartilage is by two ways, <bold>appositional growth</bold> (differentiation and proliferation of chondrogenic cells in the perichondrium) and <bold>interstitial growth</bold> (proliferation of deeper chondrocytes).</p></li>
<li><p class="">Like ordinary connective tissue a cartilage has cells (chondrocytes), fibers (collagen and elastic) and ground substance (chondroitin sulphate, i.e., acid mucopolysaccharide). Later two are collectively called as matrix. Ground substance is metachromatic. Matrix is divisible into capsule or territorial matrix (immediately surrounding the cells, newly formed, without fibers and more basophilic) and interterritorial matrix (remaining areas).</p></li>
<li><p class="">Chondrocytes are derived from the mesenchymal cells, found in lacunae and produce fibers and ground substance.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">Old cells are incapable of multiplication but capable of secreting an enzyme alkaline phosphatase causing calcification in old age.</p>

<div class="section" id="ch5lev2sec1"><h2 class="title">Hyaline Cartilage/White Cartilage</h2>
<p class="noindent">It has highly basophilic homogenous matrix because of similar refractive index of ground substance and collagen fibers. Towards the center, the chondrocytes are large and usually in groups of two or more, called ‘cell nests’. The matrix immediately around the lacunae of chondrocytes and cell nests is called ‘territorial or lacunar matrix’, it is newly formed and it stains deeper. In contrast the matrix separating the cell nests is pale and called ‘interstitial matrix’.<a name="page53"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">53</span></span></p>
<p class="indent">Perichondrium has outer fibrous layer and inner cellular layer of fibroblasts, e.g., Costal cartilage, tracheal rings, thyroid, cricoid and articular cartilage and epiphyseal plate.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch5lev2sec2"><h2 class="title">Elastic Cartilage/Yellow Cartilage</h2>
<p class="noindent">Presence of elastic fibers forming network in the matrix, rest of the feature is same as general feature of hyaline cartilage, e.g., Ear pinna, external auditory meatus, auditory tube, epiglottis, corniculate and cuneiform cartilage.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch5lev2sec3"><h2 class="title">Fibrocartilage</h2>
<p class="noindent">Presence of dense bundles of collagen fibers and rows of chondrocytes between the bundles. It has no perichondrium. Here collagen is different from that in hyaline cartilage, so this cartilage has great tensile strength and elasticity, e.g., Intervertebral disc, glenoidal and acetabular labrum.<a name="page54"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">54</span></span></p>

<div class="sidebar">
<p class="">Basophilic homogenous matrix. Large chondrocytes in the center, cell nests, deeply stained territorial and pale stained interterritorial matrix. Perichondrium presents outer fibrous layer and inner cellular layer of fibroblasts.</p>

<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Tumors of cartilage:</bold> Cartilage cells can give rise to benign (<bold>chondroma</bold>) or malignant (<bold>chondrosarcoma</bold>) tumors.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Degeneration of Hyaline cartilage:</bold> In contrast to other tissues, hyaline cartilage is more susceptible to degenerative aging processes. Calcification of the matrix, preceded by an increase in the size and volume of the chondrocytes and followed by their death, is a common process in some cartilage. Asbestiform degeneration, frequent in aged cartilage, is due to the formation of localized aggregates of thick, abnormal collagen fibrils.</p></li>
