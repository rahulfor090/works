</div><div class="section" id="ch7lev1sec1"><h1 class="title">INTRODUCTION</h1>
<p class="noindent">A muscle is a collection of muscle fibers supported by connective tissue. Each muscle fiber is an elongated cell containing contractile protein myofilaments/myofibrils mainly actin and myosin, which provide a contractile property. Special terms are used for the cytoplasmic organelles of muscle fiber like sarcolemma (plasma membrane), sarcoplasm (cytoplasm), sarcoplasmic reticulum (smooth endoplasmic reticulum), and sarcosomes (mitochondria).</p>
<p class="noindent"><bold>Types</bold></p>
<p class="noindent">There are three types of muscle:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p class="">Skeletal</p></li>
<li><p class="">Smooth</p></li>
<li><p class="">Cardiac</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="noindent">Apart from above three types, there are contractile cells functioning as single cell units like:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li><p class="">Myoepithelial cells (in secretary acini)</p></li>
<li><p class="">Myofibroblasts (in healing wounds)</p></li>
</ol>
</div><div class="section" id="ch7lev1sec2"><h1 class="title">SKELETAL MUSCLE</h1>
<p class="noindent">Synonyms are striated or voluntary muscle.</p>
<p class="indent">It is most abundant, attached to skeleton and supplied by somatic nerve, e.g., muscles of body wall and limbs.</p>
<p class="indent">The muscle fibers are elongated, cylindrical and multinucleated cells, whose length varies from few millimeters to 35 cm and width from 10 to 100 micron.<a name="page65"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">65</span></span></p>
<p class="noindent">The muscle fibers are supported by connective tissue framework which is organized as:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li><p class=""><bold>Epimysium:</bold> Sheath covering the whole muscle</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Perimysium:</bold> Sheath covering the bundles/fasciculi of muscle fibers</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Endomysium:</bold> A thin sheath covering individual muscle fibers.</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="noindent">The connective tissue framework carries blood vessels and nerves.</p>
<p class="indent">Each muscle fiber or cell presents; many flat nuclei just beneath the sarcolemma, cross striations of alternate dark (A) and light (I) bands with Z line intersecting each I band; myofibrils which are long cylindrical, compactly packed and lying parallel to the long axis of cell. The cross striations seen in a muscle fiber under LM (light microscope) is actually cross striations in the myofibrils. The distance between two Z lines is a contractile unit called sarcomere.</p>
<p class="indent">From morphological, histochemical and functional points of view, the skeletal muscle fibers are classified as red, white and intermediate type. The red and white colors are due to presence of high and low content of myoglobin (analogous to hemoglobin) respectively.</p>
</div><div class="section" id="ch7lev1sec3"><h1 class="title">SMOOTH MUSCLE</h1>
<p class="noindent">Synonyms are nonstriated, plain, visceral or involuntary muscle.</p>
<p class="indent">It lies in the walls of viscera and is supplied by autonomic nerves, e.g., GIT, blood vessels, ureter, uterine tube, vas deferens, etc. The muscle fibers are elongated spindle-shaped cells measuring about 30 microns in length in blood vessels and 200 to 500 microns in pregnant uterus. Nucleus is single, elongated and central.</p>
<p class="indent">The muscle fibers show longitudinal striations or myofibrils under higher magnifications.</p>
<p class="indent">The muscle fibers are lying in groups in such a manner that fusiform body of one cell lies opposite to the tapering end of another, so all the fibers do not show nuclei in transverse section of muscle.</p>
</div><div class="section" id="ch7lev1sec4"><h1 class="title">CARDIAC MUSCLE</h1>
<p class="noindent">It forms the myocardium of heart and shows continuous rhythmic contractions.</p>
<p class="indent">The muscle shows some similarity with the skeletal and the smooth muscle both. Like skeletal muscle it presents striations and like smooth muscle it is involuntary and contracts automatically. The striations (dark A and light I bands) are less prominent than the skeletal muscle.</p>
<p class="indent">The muscle fibers are shorter than skeletal muscle fibers and show branching and anastomosing pattern. Nucleus is single, oval and central (some cells binucleated). The striking feature is presence of darkly stained transverse lines across the muscle fibers called intercalated discs which are specialized junctions between the ends of cells. The intercalated discs are better seen with silver stain.</p>
<p class="indent">The conducting system of the heart (SA node, AV node, bundle of His and Purkinje fibers) is made of modified cardiac muscle fibers which are thicker, larger and contain few myofilaments.<a name="page66"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">66</span></span></p>

<div class="section" id="ch7lev2sec4"><h2 class="title">Clinical Correlation/Vertical Integration</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Hypertrophy:</bold> The increase in muscle caused by formation of new myofibrils and a pronounced growth in the diameter of individual muscle fibers and characterized by augmentation of cell volume, is called <bold>hypertrophy</bold> (Gr. <span class="italic">hyper,</span> above, + <span class="italic">trophe,</span> nourishment).</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Hyperplasia:</bold> Tissue growth caused by an increase in the number of cells is termed <bold>hyperplasia</bold> (<span class="italic">hyper</span> + Gr. <span class="italic">plasis,</span> molding). Hyperplasia does not occur in either skeletal or cardiac muscle but does take place in smooth muscle, whose cells have not lost the capacity to divide by mitosis. Hyperplasia is rather frequent in organs such as the uterus, where both hyperplasia and hypertrophy occur during pregnancy.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Atrophy:</bold> It is a decrease in the size of an organ or tissue, usually due to disease or changes in functional requirements. When the nerve supply of skeletal muscle is damaged, the individual muscle fibers innervated by that nerve become smaller and thinner, giving the impression of ‘wasting away’ of the affected muscle. A more common example of this process of atrophy is seen when muscles are not used for a period of time (e.g., when a limb is immobilized in plaster to allow healing of a broken bone). The muscles in that area become visibly smaller and, when the plaster is removed, muscle strength is reduced. So long as the nerves supplying the muscle remain intact, exercise can reverse this process and function of the broken limb can be regained.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Muscular dystrophy:</bold> It is weakness and wasting of muscles due to a defect in one of the proteins involved in muscle function. Gene mutations affecting proteins of the membrane linkage complex are an important cause of the group of muscular dystrophies. Other genes coding for contractile and other structural proteins may also cause muscular dystrophy. Some people have a mutation in the gene for dystrophin that results in inefficient linking of contractile forces to the support tissues in muscle. Muscle does not function correctly, and fibers undergo progressive damage with repeated contraction, ultimately leading to death of muscle cells.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Myasthenia gravis</bold> is an autoimmune disorder characterized by progressive muscular weakness caused by a reduction in the number of functionally active acetylcholine receptors in the sarcolemma of the myoneural junction. This reduction is caused by circulating antibodies that bind to the acetylcholine receptors in the junctional folds and inhibit normal nerve muscle communication. As the body attempts to correct the condition, membrane segments with affected receptors are internalized, digested by lysosomes, and replaced by newly formed receptors. These receptors, however, are again made unresponsive to acetylcholine by the same antibodies, and the disease follows its progressive course.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Three major types of muscle tumors are <bold>leiomyomas, rhabdomyomas, and rhabdomyosarcomas</bold>.
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p class=""><bold>Leiomyoma</bold> is a benign tumor of smooth muscles (such as those in the walls of the intestines and of blood vessels). It is most frequently located in the uterus.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Rhabdomyoma</bold> is a benign tumor of striated muscle. Rhabdomyomas may be either «cardiac» or «extra cardiac». A common histological feature is the presence of Spider Cells, which are cardiac myocytes with enlarged glycogen vacuoles separated by eosinophilic strands, resembling the legs of a spider. It is most commonly associated with the tongue, and heart, but can also occur in other locations, such as the vagina.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS)</bold> is a highly aggressive form of cancer that develops from mesenchymal cells that have failed to fully differentiate into myocytes of skeletal muscle. Cells of the tumor are identified as rhabdomyoblasts.</p></li></ol></p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Conducting system of the heart</bold>: Coordinated contraction of cardiac muscle is critical in allowing the heart to function effectively as a pump, supplying blood to the tissues of the body. Rapid spread of excitation through the whole myocardium is achieved via a highly specialized system of modified cardiac muscle cells known as the conducting system. In short, electrical excitation begins in the cells of the sino-atrial node, also known as ‘pacemaker cells’, and then spreads through the atria of the heart, initiating atrial contraction before the ventricles are depolarized, so that blood can first be pumped from the atria to fill the ventricles. The atrio-ventricular node then transmits the cardiac action potential into the ventricles via the bundle of His or atrio-ventricular bundle. This electrical pathway runs through the interventricular septum of the heart and allows ventricular depolarization and contraction to spread from the apex of the heart towards the ventricular outflow tracts, facilitating effective expulsion of blood from the ventricles with each heartbeat. Disorders of heart rhythm may arise due to myocardial ischemia or infarction, as described previously or may be produced by more specific disorders of the conducting system itself. Abnormal heart rhythm or arrhythmia is a fairly common medical problem and its clinical features may range from immediately life-threatening medical emergencies through to other forms which may give rise to only mild or intermittent symptoms.<a name="page71"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">71</span></span></p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Diseases affecting the heart muscle</bold>: Heart disease is an important cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Its causes vary dramatically across different geographical areas and, in some parts of the world, conditions such as poor nutrition and infections result in serious cardiac disease. In the developed world, coronary artery atheroma is the root cause of the vast majority of cardiac pathology, including disorders such as angina pectoris (crushing chest pain due to ischemia of the heart muscle), arrhythmias and cardiac failure. Cardiac failure occurs when the muscle of the heart is unable to pump effectively and cannot deliver enough blood supply to meet the body's metabolic needs. This results in a diverse range of symptoms because of the effects on many other organs of the body, particularly the lungs. Symptoms include fatigue, breathlessness (fluid can build up in the lungs due to back pressure caused by ineffective emptying of blood from the heart) and peripheral oedema (swelling of the tissues occurs because of accumulation of tissue fluid in the interstitial space due to back pressure in the venous system).</p></li>
