</ul></p>
</div><div class="section" id="ch14lev1sec1"><h1 class="title">INTRODUCTION</h1>
<p class="noindent">It consists of:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">A pair of testis: the male gonad or primary sex gland which produce male gametes or spermatozoa and male sex hormone testosterone</p></li>
<li><p class="">A pair of genital duct system consisting of epididymis, vas deferens and ejaculatory duct, which conduct sperms to urethra</p></li>
<li><p class="">Accessory sex glands including a pair of seminal vesicles, a prostate and a pair of bulbourethral glands, which produce seminal fluid to transport and nourish the sperms and</p></li>
<li><p class="">The penis, the organ of copulation.</p></li>
</ul>
</div><div class="section" id="ch14lev1sec2"><h1 class="title">TESTIS</h1>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Microscopically testis is surrounded (except posterior border) by a serous sac called tunica vaginalis.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Deep to tunica vaginalis is a thick fibrous capsule called tunica albuginea, which is thickened along the posterior border called mediastinum testis.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The mediastinum testis sends septa to tunica albuginea to divide the testis in compartments or lobules.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Each lobule contains 1–4 highly convoluted seminiferous tubules.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Internal to tunica albuginea lies a layer of vascular loose connective tissue called tunica vasculosa which surrounds the seminiferous tubules and contains clusters of endocrine cells called interstitial cells of Leydig which are polyhedral in shape and produce testosterone necessary for spermatogenesis and development of secondary sex characters.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The mediastinum testis has a network of tubules called rete testis which is connected to seminiferous tubules through straight tubules.<a name="page142"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">142</span></span></p></li>
<li><p class="">The straight tubules are lined by simple cuboidal or columnar epithelium whereas rete testis is lined by simple squamous or cuboidal epithelium.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The rete testis is connected to epididymis through 10–15 efferent ductules emerging from the upper part of testis. These efferent ductules are lined by alternate groups of ciliated tall columnar cells and cuboidal cells with microvilli.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Seminiferous tubules (each 50–80 cm long and 150 to 250 μm in diameter) are highly coiled tubules where spermatogenesis takes place and spermatozoa are formed.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">These tubules are lined by specialized stratified germinal epithelium consisting of two types of cells resting on basement membrane:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li><p class="">Spermatogenic cells of spermatogenesis [from basement membrane to lumen these are spermatogonium, primary spermatocyte (largest germ cell), secondary spermatocyte, spermatid and spermatozoa or sperm]. Under higher magnification, each spermatozoon (about 60 μm) shows head (5 μm), neck and tail [tail has middle piece (5 μm), principal piece (45 μm) and end piece (5 μm)]</p></li>
<li><p class="">Sertoli cells which support and nourish spermatogenic cells. They are tall columnar cells with many cytoplasmic processes surrounding the spermatogenic cells. The adjacent Sertoli cells are joined by tight junctions and form blood-testis barrier between basal and luminal compartments of seminiferous tubule. This barrier prevents entry of harmful substances from blood affecting spermatogenesis and at the same time prevents entry of sperm-related protein (antigen) into the blood to set an autoimmune response to one's own sperms. Outside the basement membrane of tubules are lying a few contractile smooth muscles like cells called myoid cells.</p></li>
</ol>
</div><div class="section" id="ch14lev1sec3"><h1 class="title">EPIDIDYMIS</h1>
<p class="noindent">Divisible into head, body and tail. It is made of about 6 m long highly coiled tube, ductus epididymis supported by vascular connective tissue. The ductus epididymis is lined by pseudostratified columnar epithelium having tall columnar cells with microvilli (stereocilia for secretion and absorption) and small basal cells. Beneath the epithelium there is a layer of smooth muscle fibers. This layer of muscle gradually increases in thickness from head to tail and may present inner circular and outer longitudinal layers in tail region. Sperms are present in the lumen.</p>
</div><div class="section" id="ch14lev1sec4"><h1 class="title">VAS DEFERENS (DUCTUS DEFERENS)</h1>
<p class="noindent">The wall of vas deferens presents three coats, from within outside:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Mucous coat</span>: Which comprises the pseudostratified columnar epithelium with stereocilia and underlying lamina propria. It shows longitudinal folds so lumen is stellate shaped</p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Muscular coat</span>: Consists of smooth muscle fibers arranged into inner longitudinal, middle circular and outer longitudinal layers</p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Adventitial coat</span>: Consists of fibroelastic connective tissue carrying blood vessels and nerves. Sperms are present in the lumen.</p></li>
</ol>
</div><div class="section" id="ch14lev1sec5"><h1 class="title">PROSTATE</h1>
<p class="noindent">The prostate gland is surrounded by two capsules: An inner true capsule of condensed fibromuscular stroma and an outer false capsule of pelvic fascia. A rich venous plexus lies between the two capsules.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Microscopically it presents two parts, the glandular parenchyma and fibromuscular stroma. The glandular part is divided into three groups which are arranged concentrically around the urethra; namely mucosal, submucosal and main glands</p></li>
<li><p class="">The mucosal glands are small tubular glands in the inner zone which open directly into the urethra.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The submucosal and main glands are branched tubuloalveolar glands in the intermediate and outer zones respectively. Their long ducts open into the prostatic sinus of the urethra.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The glandular parenchyma shows large irregular prostatic follicles or alveoli lined by simple cuboidal to columnar epithelium depending on secretory activity<a name="page143"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">143</span></span></p></li>
<li><p class="">The lumen may contain spherical prostatic concretions or corpora amylacea formed by condensed secretions.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The number of corpora amylacea increases with the age and they may become calcified.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The fibromuscular stroma consists of smooth muscle fibers mixed with connective tissue fibers with blood vessels, nerves and lymphatics.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Usually mucosal and submucosal glands undergo hypertrophy in 50% men after age of 50 years, called BPH causing partial or complete obstruction of urethra. Carcinoma of prostate affects main glands and is second most common cancer in elderly men.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The prostate traverses the prostatic urethra which is crescent shaped with many outpouching or diverticula and lined by the transitional epithelium in the upper part and stratified columnar epithelium in the lower part. The prostate also contains a pair of ejaculatory duct (lined by simple columnar epithelium) and a median prostatic utricle (lined by transitional or stratified columnar epithelium).</p></li>

<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Immotile cilia syndrome</bold> in men is characterized by immotile spermatozoa and consequent infertility. It is due to a lack of dynein or other proteins required for ciliary and flagellar motility in the cells of the diseased person. This disorder usually coincides with chronic respiratory infections because of impaired motility of the ciliary axonemes of respiratory epithelial cells.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Differentiation of spermatogonial cells leads to the appearance of sperm-specific proteins. Because sexual maturity occurs long after the development of immunocompetence, differentiating sperm cells could be recognized as foreign and provoke an immune response that would destroy the germ cells. The blood-testis barrier hinders interactions between developing sperm and the immune system. This barrier prevents the passage of immunoglobulins into the seminiferous tubule and accounts for the lack of impaired fertility in men whose serum contains high levels of sperm antibodies. The Sertoli cell barrier thus functions to protect the seminiferous epithelium against an autoimmune reaction.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Failure of descent of the testes into the scrotum (<bold>cryptorchidism</bold> [Gr. <span class="italic">kryptos,</span> hidden, + <span class="italic">orchis,</span> testis]) maintains the testes at 37°C, which inhibits spermatogenesis. In cases that are not too far advanced, spermatogenesis can occur normally if the testes are moved surgically to the scrotum. For this reason, it is important to examine male newborns to determine if the testicles are present in the scrotum. Although germ cell proliferation is inhibited by abdominal temperature, testosterone synthesis is not. This explains why men with cryptorchidism can be sterile but still develop secondary male characteristics and achieve erection.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Malnutrition, alcoholism, and the action of certain drugs lead to alterations in spermatogonia, with a resulting decrease in production of spermatozoa. X-irradiation and cadmium salts are quite toxic to cells of the spermatogenic lineage, causing the death of those cells and sterility in animals. The drug busulfan acts on the germinal cells; when administered to pregnant female rats, it promotes the death of the germinal cells of their offspring. The offspring are therefore sterile, and their seminiferous tubules contain only Sertoli cells.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Benign prostatic hypertrophy</bold> is present in 50% of men more than 50 years of age and in 95% of men more than 70 years of age. It leads to obstruction of the urethra with clinical symptoms in only 5–10% of cases.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Malignant prostatic tumor</bold> is the second most common form of cancer in men and the third leading cause of cancer deaths. One of the products of the prostate, the prostate-specific antigen, is secreted into the blood. Because its concentration in the serum often increases during malignancy, it is useful for diagnosis and control of treatment of the tumor.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The new drugs developed for treatment of penile erectile dysfunction act on an enzyme, a <bold>phosphodiesterase</bold>, present in the corpus cavernosum, which regulates cyclic nucleotides such as guanosine monophosphate.</p></li>
