<div class="section" id="ch6lev2sec1"><h2 class="title">Morphologically</h2>
<p class="noindent">Compact bone—externally forms the solid shell of cortical bone (shaft of long bones and tables of flat bone).</p>
<p class="noindent">Cancellous bone—internally a framework of trabeculae separated by marrow spaces (inside short bones, ends of long bones and diploe of flat bones).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch6lev2sec2"><h2 class="title">Microscopically</h2>
<p class="noindent">Compact bone may be</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p class=""><bold>Primary/immature/woven bone,</bold> i.e., newly formed bone during growth and repair, e.g., Callus</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Secondary/mature/lamellar bone,</bold> i.e., definite adult type bone<a name="page59"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">59</span></span></p></li>
</ol>
<p class="noindent">External and internal surfaces of bones are covered by membranes called periosteum and endosteum respectively.</p>
<p class="indent">Periosteum is a dense connective tissue membrane having an outer fibrous layer and an inner cellular (osteogenic) layer. It sends perforating fibers perpendicular to the bone surface to nail or anchor it to the cortical bone; these fibers are called Sharpey's fibers.</p>
<p class="indent">Endosteum is a loose connective tissue membrane lining the medullary cavity of long bones and marrow spaces of spongy bones. The cells of endosteum have osteogenic potential by differentiating into osteoblasts. So, because of this osteogenic characteristic the periosteum and endosteum should be preserved during bone surgery.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch6lev2sec3"><h2 class="title">Cells</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Osteoprogenitor cells:</bold> These are derived from the mesenchymal cells and differentiate into osteoblasts</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Osteoblasts:</bold> Young cells, cuboidal in shape with basophilic cytoplasm and single, large, round euchromatic nucleus, found on the bone surface and called bone forming cells</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Osteocytes (derived from osteoblasts):</bold> Mature cells, oval in shape with less basophilic cytoplasm and with cytoplasmic processes, single, small elongated heterochromatic nucleus, found embedded in the bony matrix and surrounded by lacuna and canaliculi and called bone maintaining cells and</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Osteoclasts</bold> <bold>(derived from blood monocytes):</bold> Large irregular giant cells with acidophilic cytoplasm and many nuclei, found on the surface of the bone in Howship's lacuna, having phagocytic action and called bone destroyer cells.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">Fibers are collagen type and form 95% part of bone.</p>
<p class="indent">Ground substance is made up of chondroitin sulphate, dermatan sulphate and glycoprotein. Fibers and ground substance form the organic component of bone and give elasticity and resilience to the bone.</p>
<p class="indent">Inorganic component of the matrix (calcium phosphate 85%, calcium carbonate 10% and other salt 5%) gives hardness and rigidity to the bone.</p>
<p class="noindent">Microscopically the <bold>compact bone</bold> presents three systems of bony lamellae or plates:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p class=""><bold>Circumferential system:</bold> Outer (periosteal) and inner (endosteal)</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Haversian system or osteon</bold> and</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Interstitial system:</bold> Outer circumferential system presents circular lamellae of bony matrix just beneath periosteum. Inner circumferential system presents circular lamellae of bony matrix just outside the endosteum. Osteocytes are present between the lamellae in lacunae. Haversian systems are present between the outer and inner circumferential systems and are long cylindrical often branching units parallel to the long axis of the shaft. Each system has a central Haversian canal surrounded by 4–20 concentric lamellae. The Haversian canal is lined by the endosteum and contains blood vessels, lymphatics, nerves and loose CT. The Haversian canals communicate with each other, with the periosteum and with the medullary cavity through transverse or oblique channels called Volkmann's canals. New lamellae are formed around the neurovascular bundles in the canal. Osteocytes are present between lamellae in elliptical lacunae. Tiny canals called canaliculi radiate from the lacunae and anastomose freely with those of the other lacunae and Haversian canals. These canaliculi contain processes of osteocytes. Interstitial system occupies triangular intervals between Haversian systems, and formed by remnants of destroying Haversian systems during growth and remodeling of bone.</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="indent">The <bold>spongy bone</bold> presents slender bony trabeculae which branch and anastomose with one another enclosing irregular marrow spaces between them containing bone marrow. Trabeculae consist of parallel lamellae with osteocytes in lacunae in between; and lined by endosteum containing osteoprogenitor, osteoblasts and osteoclasts cells.</p>
<p class="indent">Initially all bone marrow is red with hemopoietic power but as age advances the red marrow is gradually replaced by the yellow marrow with no power of hemopoiesis.<a name="page60"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">60</span></span></p>

<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">The fluorescent antibiotic tetracycline interacts with great affinity with recently deposited mineralized bone matrix. Based on this interaction, a method was developed to measure the rate of bone apposition, an important parameter in the study of bone growth and the diagnosis of bone growth diseases. Tetracycline is administered twice to patients, with an interval of 5 days between injections. A bone biopsy is then performed, and the sections are studied by means of fluorescence microscopy. The distance between the two fluorescent layers is proportional to the rate of bone apposition. This procedure is of diagnostic importance in diseases such as <bold>osteomalacia,</bold> in which mineralization is impaired, and <bold>osteitis fibrosa cystica,</bold> in which increased osteoclast activity results in removal of bone matrix and fibrous degeneration.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Osteopetrosis</bold> (<span class="italic">L. petra</span>, stone), is a genetic disease characterized by dense, heavy bones (marble bones), the osteoclasts lack ruffled borders, and bone resorption is defective. There is defect in osteoclast function that results in overgrowth, thickening, and hardening of bones. This process produces obliteration of the bone marrow cavities, depressing blood cell formation with consequent anemia and frequent infections that may be fatal.</p></li>
<li><p class="">When a bone is fractured, bone matrix is destroyed and bone cells adjoining the fracture die. The damaged blood vessels produce a localized hemorrhage and form a blood clot.</p></li>
<li><p class="">During repair, the blood clot, cells, and damaged bone matrix are removed by macrophages. The periosteum and the endosteum around the fracture respond with intense proliferation producing a tissue that surrounds the fracture and penetrates between the extremities of the fractured bone.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Stresses imposed on the bone during repair and during the patient's gradual return to activity serve to remodel the bone callus. Unlike other connective tissues, bone tissue heals without forming a scar.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Because the concentration of calcium in tissues and blood must be kept constant, nutritional deficiency of calcium results in decalcification of bones; decalcified bones are more likely to fracture and are more transparent to X-rays.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Decalcification of bone may also be caused by excessive production of parathyroid hormone (hyperparathyroidism), which results in increased osteoclastic activity, intense resorption of bone, elevation of blood Ca<sup>2+</sup> and PO4<sup>3−</sup> levels, and abnormal deposits of calcium in several organs, mainly the kidneys and arterial walls.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Obesity imposes significant strain on the articular cartilage, accelerating its degeneration. Joint problems are far more frequent in obese individuals.</p></li>
