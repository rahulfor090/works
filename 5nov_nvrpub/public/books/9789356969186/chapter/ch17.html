<div class="section" id="ch17lev2sec2"><h2 class="title">Structure of a Multipolar Neuron</h2>
<p class="noindent">Each nerve cell is an irregular cell having cell body and processes. The cell bodies of all neurons are situated in the gray matter of CNS and ganglia of PNS.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li><p class=""><bold>Cell body or Soma or Perikaryon:</bold> Its size is variable from 4 to 16 micron. Nucleus is large, spherical, pale or vesicular and central (eccentric in neurons of autonomic ganglia, Clarke's column of spinal cord and some pathological conditions), sometimes binucleated as in sympathetic ganglia. Cytoplasm: In addition to the usual organelles, it also contains Nissl granules, neurofibrils and pigment granules. Nissl granules/substance/bodies or Tigroid bodies are granular endoplasmic reticulum which is chromophilic (having affinity for basic dyes like Toluidine blue) and having granular appearance in large cells and diffuse mass-like appearance in small cells. Nissl granules are arranged around nucleus and extend into the dendrites but absent in the axon hillock (origin point of axon) and axon. Neurofibrils or neurofilaments form interlacing arrangement in cell body and parallel arrangement in dendrites and axon. They are seen with silver staining. Pigment granules include melanin (dark brown) and lipofuscin (residual bodies not digested by lysosomes) pigments.<a name="page176"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">176</span></span></p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Processes are two types</bold>, dendrites and axon. Dendrites are many short, branched, varicose and afferent processes whereas axon or axis cylinder is single, long, with occasional branching, of uniform thickness and efferent process. Its plasma membrane is called axolemma and cytoplasm is called axoplasm. Axon terminates by dividing into many small branches axon terminals, ending in small swellings terminal boutons.</p></li>

</div><div class="section" id="ch17lev1sec4"><h1 class="title">NERVE FIBERS</h1>
<p class="noindent">A nerve fiber is an axon with its coverings of myelin sheath, Schwann cell sheath (only one of them or none) and endoneurium.</p>
<p class="noindent">The nerve fibers are classified as:</p>
<div class="informalfigure"><img alt="" src="/MediumImage/176-1.jpg"></div>
<p class="noindent">A myelinated nerve fiber presents:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li><p class="">Axon or axis cylinder</p></li>
<li><p class="">Myelin sheath outside the axon consisting of lipid and proteins. It is laid down by Schwann cells in peripheral nerve fibers and by oligodendrocytes in central nerve fibers. It is non-stainable with routine H&amp;E stains but stains black with osmic acid. It is interrupted at intervals called nodes of Ranvier and a segment between two nodes of Ranvier is called internode or internodal segment. Myelin of one internode is formed by one Schwann cell and shows cone shaped clefts called Schmidt Lanterman clefts representing remnants of cytoplasm of Schwann cell</p></li>
<li><p class="">Schwann cell sheath: Present outside the myelin sheath. The nuclei of the Schwann cells are flat and indent the myelin sheath and bulge on the surface. In central myelinated fibers, Schwann cells are replaced by oligodendrocytes</p></li>
<li><p class="">Endoneurium is outside the Schwann cell sheath and consists of a delicate connective tissue.</p></li>
</ol>
</div><div class="section" id="ch17lev1sec5"><h1 class="title">PERIPHERAL NERVE</h1>
<p class="noindent">Each peripheral nerve (spinal or cranial) consists of bundles or funiculi of nerve fibers or axons in a connective tissue framework which is organized as: (i) Epineurium ensheathing the whole nerve, (ii) Perineurium ensheathing each funiculus and (iii) Endoneurium ensheathing each nerve fibers outside the Schwann cell sheath. In case of optic nerve, it is surrounded by meningeal coverings of dura, arachnoid and pia mater.</p>

<p class="noindent">These are oval bodies made of aggregation of cell bodies of neurons outside the CNS. They serve as relay centers in the neural pathways. They are usually covered by a dense connective capsule called epineurium. The cell bodies of neurons are enveloped by a layer of cuboidal cells called satellite/capsular cells. Morphologically and functionally, there are two types of ganglia, sensory and motor.<a name="page177"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">177</span></span></p>
<div class="section" id="ch17lev2sec4"><h2 class="title">Differences Between Sensory and Motor Ganglia</h2>
<p class="noindent">Sensory (somatic) ganglia, e.g., spinal ganglia. Neurons are pseudounipolar, large, rounded, of varying size (in section) and found in groups. Nucleus is central. Well-defined satellite cells are present.</p>
<p class="indent">Motor (autonomic) ganglia, e.g., sympathetic ganglia. Neurons are multipolar, small, angular, of uniform size (in section) and found scattered. Nucleus is eccentric. Satellite cells are poorly defined.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch17lev2sec5"><h2 class="title">Cerebral Cortex</h2>
<p class="noindent">It consists of gray matter and its surface area is increased by presence of sulci and gyri. The gray matter contains nerve cells, fibers, neuroglia and blood vessels; and forms poorly defined 6 layers which are named according to the type and density of the cells as follows from superficial to deep side:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Molecular or plexiform layer:</bold> Well defined and consists mainly of nerve fibers and occasional horizontal cells of Cajal.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>External granular layer:</bold> Contains large number of stellate cells and small pyramidal cells.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>External pyramidal layer:</bold> Contains mainly medium sized pyramidal cells and few stellate cells and cells of Martinotti.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Internal granular layer:</bold> Contains closely packed stellate cells and horizontally oriented white fiber band called outer band of Baillarger.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Internal pyramidal or ganglionic layer:</bold> Contains mainly large pyramidal cells and few stellate cells and cells of Martinotti. The giant pyramidal cells in the motor cortex are called Betz cells. This layer also has inner band of Baillarger.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Multiform layer or layer of polymorphic cells: Contains mainly fusiform cells and few stellate cells and cells of Martinotti intermixed with entering and leaving nerve fibers from underlying white matter.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">(Cell of Martinotti is small multipolar cell, horizontal cell of Cajal is spindle or fusiform shaped oriented horizontally).</p>
</div>
</div><div class="section" id="ch17lev1sec7"><h1 class="title">CEREBELLAR CORTEX</h1>
<p class="noindent">It is highly folded. The folds are folia are separated by closely set parallel fissures. Each folium has a core of white matter also. The cortex consists of three layers from superficial to deep:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p class=""><bold>Molecular layer:</bold> A thick layer consists mainly of nerve fibers and few stellate cells in the superficial part and basket cells in the deeper part. The collaterals of basket cells are arranged in basket-like manner around the Purkinje cells.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Purkinje cell layer:</bold> Contains large flask shaped cells arranged in single layer.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Granular layer:</bold> Contains densely packed small granule neurons (the smallest cell in the body) and few Golgi cells (type II). The dendrites of granule cells and axons of Golgi cells synapse with the dilated terminals of Mossy fibers to form lightly stained areas called glomeruli.</p></li>
</ol>
<div class="section" id="ch17lev2sec6"><h2 class="title">Spinal Cord</h2>
<p class="noindent">Extends from the lower end of medulla oblongata (upper level of C1) to the lower level of L1. Its lowest part is conical called ‘conus medullaris’ which is continuous with a fibrous cord called the ‘filum terminale’. The spinal cord has 31 segments: 8 Cervical, 12 Thoracic, 5 Lumbar, 5 Sacral and 1 Coccygeal. Each segment gives rise a pair of spinal nerve, so 31 pairs of spinal nerves. Each spinal nerve arises by two roots anterior (ventral) and posterior (dorsal). Each root is formed by a number of rootlets. The nerve roots below the level of L1 vertebra occupy the lower part of vertebral canal and constitute the ‘cauda equina’. Dorsal root arises from a posterolateral sulcus. Just proximal to the junction of roots the dorsal root presents a swelling called ‘dorsal nerve root ganglion’ or ‘spinal ganglion’.</p>
<p class="indent">In transverse section the spinal cord shows a central ‘H’ shaped gray matter in which comma shaped right and left masses are connected by a transverse band the ‘gray commissure’ traversed by a ‘central canal’ containing CSF. Each half is divided into the anterior and posterior gray columns or horns, between T2 to L1 segments there is the lateral gray column or horn. The central gray matter is surrounded by the white matter which is divided into posterior, lateral and anterior funiculi between posterior median septum, anterior median fissure, posterolateral sulcus and anterior root of spinal nerve. The anterior gray column does not reach the surface whereas the posterior reaches the surface of spinal cord. Ventral to the gray commissure a layer of decussating nerve fibers the ‘ventral white commissure’ and similarly ‘dorsal white commissure’ ventral to the dorsal median septum, are present. The central canal is lined by the simple columnar ciliated epithelium and it expands in the lower part of conus medullaris to form a fusiform dilatation called ‘terminal ventricle’.<a name="page178"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">178</span></span></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>In cervical region:</bold> The section is large, oval, white matter is in greater amount, anterior gray column is wide and posterior gray column is long and slender.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>In thoracic region:</bold> The section is small, circular, anterior and posterior gray columns both are slender and shows lateral gray column (T2-L1).</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>In lumber region:</bold> The section is larger than thoracic region due to very wide gray columns.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>In sacral region:</bold> The conus medullaris presents two large oval masses of gray matter one on each side connected by a broad gray commissure.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">In anterior gray column the neurons are multipolar (large and small) and Golgi type I and II. It is divisible into medial, central and lateral groups</p>
<p class="noindent">The posterior gray column presents cell groups as:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">

<li><p class="">Visceral gray column: Lateral to Nucleus Dorsalis (T1-L3).</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="noindent">The intermediate region gray column presents intermediolateral and intermediomedial groups.

<li><p class="">Local anesthetics are hydrophobic molecules that bind to sodium channels, inhibiting sodium transport and, consequently, also the action potential responsible for the nerve impulse.</p></li>
<li><p class="">In <bold>Multiple Sclerosis</bold>, the myelin sheath is destroyed by an unknown mechanism with severe neurological consequences. In this disease, microglia phagocytose and degrade myelin debris by receptor-mediated phagocytosis and lysosomal activity. In addition, AIDS dementia complex is caused by human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection of the central nervous system. Overwhelming experimental evidence indicates that microglia are infected by HIV-1. A number of cytokines, such as interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor, activate and enhance HIV replication in microglia.</p></li>
<li><p class="">A decrease in the absorption of cerebrospinal fluid or a blockage of outflow from the ventricles results in the condition known as <bold>hydrocephalus</bold> (Gr. <span class="italic">hydro,</span> water, + <span class="italic">kephale,</span> head). Hydrocephalus describes any condition in which an excess quantity of cerebrospinal fluid is present in the central nervous system cavity, increasing intracranial pressure. Congenital hydrocephalus results in an enlargement of the head, followed by mental impairment and muscular weakness. In adults, there are multiple neurological symptoms also caused by damage to brain nervous tissue.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Because nerves are widely distributed throughout the body, they are often injured. When a nerve axon is transected, degenerative changes take place, followed by a reparative phase.</p></li>
<li><p class="">In a wounded nerve fiber, it is important to distinguish the changes occurring in the proximal segment from those in the distal segment. The proximal segment maintains its continuity with the trophic center (perikaryon) and frequently regenerates. The distal segment, separated from the nerve cell body, degenerates.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Axonal injury causes several changes in the perikaryon: <bold>Chromatolysis,</bold> i.e., dissolution of Nissl substances with a consequent decrease in cytoplasmic basophilia; an increase in the volume of the perikaryon; and migration of the nucleus to a peripheral position in the perikaryon. The proximal segment of the axon degenerates close to the wound for a short distance, but growth starts as soon as debris is removed by macrophages. Macrophages produce interleukin-1, which stimulates Schwann cells to secrete substances that promote nerve growth.</p></li>
<li><p class="">In the nerve stub distal to the injury, both the axon (now separated from its trophic center) and the myelin sheath degenerate completely, and their remnants, excluding their connective tissue and perineurial sheaths, are removed by macrophages. While these regressive changes take place, Schwann cells proliferate within the remaining connective tissue sleeve, giving rise to solid cellular columns. These rows of Schwann cells serve as guides to the sprouting axons formed during the reparative phase.</p></li>
<li><p class="">After the regressive changes, the proximal segment of the axon grows and branches, forming several filaments that progress in the direction of the columns of Schwann cells. Only fibers that penetrate these Schwann cell columns will continue to grow and reach an effector organ.</p></li>
<li><p class="">When there is an extensive gap between the distal and proximal segments, or when the distal segment disappears altogether (as in the case of amputation of a limb), the newly grown nerve fibers may form a swelling, or <bold>neuroma,</bold> that can be the source of spontaneous pain.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Regeneration</bold> is functionally efficient only when the fibers and the columns of Schwann cells are directed to the correct place. The possibility is good, however, since each regenerating fiber gives origin to several processes, and each column of Schwann cells receives processes from several regenerating fibers. In an injured mixed nerve, however, if regenerating sensory fibers grow into columns connected to motor end plates that were occupied by motor fibers, the function of the muscle will not be reestablished.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Virtually all cells of the nerve tissue generate tumors. Glial cells produce gliomas, immature nerve cells produce <bold>medulloblastomas,</bold> and Schwann cells produce <bold>schwannomas.</bold> Because adult neurons do not divide, they do not produce tumors.</p></li>
