</ul>
</div><div class="section" id="ch15lev1sec2"><h1 class="title">OVARY</h1>
<p class="noindent">Microscopically each ovary is covered by a simple cuboidal epithelium called germinal epithelium, but it is a misnomer as it does not give rise to germ cells or oocytes.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Deep to germinal epithelium is a layer of dense connective tissue called tunica albuginea. Ovary shows a peripheral cortex and a central medulla.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The cortex contains ovarian follicles at different stages of maturation and degeneration. It may also contain corpus luteum and corpus albicans.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The follicles are surrounded by highly cellular connective tissue stroma containing numerous fibroblasts.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The medulla contains loose fibroelastic connective tissue containing blood vessels, lymphatics and nerves.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">At birth about 4,00,000 oocytes are present in the ovaries. Most of them degenerate before puberty and only about 40,000 oocytes remain. Of these only about 400 oocytes undergo ovulation during reproductive period (13–15 years to 45–55 years) of about 30–40 years of a female. The rest undergo degeneration/atresia.<a name="page151"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">151</span></span></p>
<p class="noindent">The follicular growth and maturation is called <bold>folliculogenesis</bold>.</p>
<p class="noindent">It has five stages:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Primordial follicle</span>: Smallest and located at the periphery of cortex. It consists of primary oocytes (about 25 um) surrounded by a single layer of squamous follicular cells</p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Primary follicle</span>: The primary oocyte enlarges (40–80 μm) and surrounding squamous cells become cuboidal. A glycoprotein layer called zona pellucida is formed between oocyte and surrounding follicular cells</p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Secondary follicle</span>: The follicular cells proliferate to form several layers and cells are now called granulosa cells. The connective tissue begins to condense outside the follicle to form theca folliculi</p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Antral follicle</span>: The primary oocyte again enlarges to its full size (about 125 μm) and irregular fluid filled spaces appear among the surrounding granulosa cells which join to form a crescentic space or antrum filled with liquor folliculi. The theca folliculi differentiate into an inner cellular theca interna and an outer fibrous theca externa</p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Mature/Graafian follicle</span>: The follicle enlarges in size and antrum divides the granulosa cells into two sets, the outer set which lines the antrum called membrana granulosa and the inner set which surrounds the oocyte is called cumulus oophorus.</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="noindent">The cells which attach oocyte to the wall are called discus proligerus. At this stage primary oocyte completes its 1st meiotic division and becomes secondary oocyte/ovum.</p>
<p class="indent">The size of follicle becomes about 10–15 mm and is seen bulging out on the surface of the ovary. At mid-menstrual cycle (about 14th day of 28 days menstrual cycle) under the influence of hormones there is sudden rise in the quantity of liquor folliculi which causes rupture of mature follicle and release of ovum with one layer of adherent granulosa cells (corona radiata) in to the peritoneal cavity</p>
<p class="noindent">This process is called ovulation. Then released ovum is drawn into the uterine tube.</p>
<p class="noindent"><bold>Atretic follicles:</bold> Several follicles start maturing during each ovarian or menstrual cycle but only one attains full maturity and undergo ovulation. The other follicles degenerate and become atretic follicles like scars.</p>
<p class="noindent"><bold>Corpus luteum:</bold> After ovulation the wall of the follicle collapses and gets transformed into a temporary endocrine organ called corpus luteum. It consists of two types of cells</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p class=""><bold>Lutein cells</bold> which are numerous, larger, with pale cytoplasm and derived from granulosa cells. They secrete hormone progesterone</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Paralutein cells</bold> which are less numerous, smaller, with dark cytoplasm and derived from theca interna cells. They secrete hormone estrogen. If the liberated ovum is fertilized the corpus luteum survives for next 4–5 months and is called <bold>corpus luteum of pregnancy</bold> but if fertilization does not take place the corpus luteum survives for only 10–12 days and is called <bold>corpus luteum of menstruation</bold>. In both cases after functional activity is over the corpus luteum undergoes regression and is replaced by a fibrous scar called the <bold>corpus albicans</bold> (white body).</p></li>

<li><p class="">In cases of abnormal nidation, the embryo may implant itself in the oviduct (<bold>ectopic pregnancy</bold>). In this case, the lamina propria reacts like the endometrium, forming numerous decidual cells. Because of its small diameter, the oviduct cannot contain the growing embryo and bursts, causing extensive hemorrhage that can be fatal if not treated immediately.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The initial attachment of the embryo usually occurs on the ventral or dorsal walls of the corpus of the uterus. Sometimes the embryo attaches close to the internal os. In this case the placenta will be interposed between the fetus and the vagina, obstructing the passage of the fetus at parturition. This situation, called placenta previa, must be recognized by the physician, and the fetus must be delivered by cesarean section; otherwise, the fetus may die. Sometimes, as already mentioned, the embryo attaches to the epithelium of the uterine tube. Very rarely the zygote may enter the abdominal cavity, attach to the peritoneum, and develop there.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Cancer of the cervix (<bold>cervical carcinoma</bold>) is derived from its stratified squamous epithelium. Although it is frequently observed, the mortality rate is low (8 per 100,000). This low rate is due to the usual discovery of the carcinoma in its early stages, made possible by yearly physical observation of the cervix and by cytological analysis of smears of the cervical epithelium (Papanicolaou test).</p></li>
<li><p class="">Exfoliative cytology is the study of the characteristics of cells that normally desquamate from various surfaces of the body. Cytological examination of cells collected from the vagina provides information of clinical importance.</p></li>
<li><p class="">In fully mature vaginal mucosa, five types of cells are easily identified: cells of the internal portion of the basal layer (basal cells), cells of the external portion of the basal layer (parabasal cells), cells of the intermediate layers, precornified cells, and cornified cells. Based on the numbers of cell types that appear in a vaginal smear, valuable information can be obtained on the hormonal status of the patient (action of estrogen and progesterone). The vaginal smear is also useful in the early detection of cervical cancer.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The first secretion from the mammary glands to appear after birth is called <bold>colostrum.</bold> It contains less fat and more protein than regular milk and is rich in antibodies (predominantly secretory IgA) that provide some degree of passive immunity to the newborn, especially within the gut lumen.</p></li>
<li><p class="">When a woman is breast-feeding, the nursing action of the child stimulates tactile receptors in the nipple, resulting in liberation of the posterior pituitary hormone <bold>oxytocin.</bold> This hormone causes contraction of myoepithelial cells in alveoli and ducts, resulting in ejection of milk (<bold>milk-ejection reflex</bold>). Negative emotional stimuli, such as frustration, anxiety, or anger, can inhibit the liberation of oxytocin and thus prevent the reflex.</p></li>
<li><p class="">About 9% of all women born in the United States will develop breast cancer at some time during their lives. Most of these cancers (carcinomas) arise from epithelial cells of the lactiferous ducts. If these cells metastasize to the lungs, brain, or bone, breast carcinoma becomes a major cause of death. Early detection (e.g., through self-examination, mammography, ultrasound, and other techniques) and consequent early treatment have significantly reduced the mortality rate from breast cancer.</p></li>
