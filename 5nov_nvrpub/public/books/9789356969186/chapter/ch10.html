</div><div class="section" id="ch10lev1sec1"><h1 class="title">INTRODUCTION</h1>
<p class="noindent">Includes skin and its appendages namely hair, nails and some glands (<span class="italic">sebaceous</span> and <span class="italic">sweat</span> glands).</p>
<div class="section" id="ch10lev2sec1"><h2 class="title">Skin</h2>
<p class="noindent">Two types:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li><p class=""><bold>Thin or hairy skin:</bold> It is present all over body except palms and soles; and has hair follicles. Here epidermis is thin.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Thick or</bold> <bold>glabrous skin:</bold> It is present in palms and soles. It has no hair and its epidermis is thick.</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch10lev2sec2"><h2 class="title">Microscopically</h2>
<p class="noindent">Skin has two layers:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li><p class=""><bold>Epidermis,</bold> which is superficial.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Dermis,</bold> which is deep and rests on a subcutaneous tissue or hypodermis.</p></li>
</ol>
<div class="section" id="ch10lev3sec1"><h3 class="title">Epidermis</h3>
<p class="noindent">Consists of stratified squamous keratinized epithelium and presents epidermal ridges into the dermis. Five layers can be distinguished in the epidermis from deep to superficial side:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li><p class=""><bold>Stratum basale or germinativum:</bold> It is also called basale or germinal layer and consists of single layer of cuboidal or low columnar cells on the basement membrane.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Stratum spinosum or Malpighian layer:</bold> Consists of several layers of polygonal cells having spine like projections of the plasma membrane hence the name. Cells contain bundles of filaments or fibrils seen under high power.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Stratum granulosum:</bold> Consists of 3–5 layers of flattened fusiform cells having basophilic keratohyalin granules.<a name="page94"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">94</span></span></p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Stratum lucidum:</bold> Consists of flattened eosinophilic enucleated dead cells forming a homogenous glassy layer. Cytoplasm contains keratin (scleroprotein) derived from keratohyalin granules and fibrils.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Stratum corneum:</bold> Consists of scale like very flattened, enucleated dead cells which undergo desquamation giving a fibrillar appearance.</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="noindent">The cells of epidermis include:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li><p class=""><bold>Keratinocytes (more than 90%):</bold> They undergo keratinization and migrate from stratum basale to surface layers.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Melanocytes</bold> are second most common cells, present in stratum basale and form dark brown melanin pigments (round with processes extending between keratinocytes).</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Langerhans</bold> cells are third most common cells, present in stratum spinosum and part of mononuclear phagocyte system (clear cells with cytoplasmic processes like melanocytes extending between keratinocytes).</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Merkel</bold> cells are sensory, present in stratum basale and associated with Merkel's discs of nerve endings for touch sensation.</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch10lev3sec2"><h3 class="title">Dermis</h3>
<p class="noindent">Presents two layers:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Superficial papillary layer</span> which forms projections into the epidermis called dermal papilla.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Deep reticular layer</span> which forms a mesh of collagen and elastic fibers. The interstices of mesh are occupied by fat, sebaceous and sweat glands, nerves and blood vessels.</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="noindent">Hair and hair follicles are formed by the epidermis and dermis and extend in both these layers and may reach the hypodermis.</p>
<p class="noindent">Glands of skin are <bold>sebaceous and sweat</bold> glands. The oily secretion of sebaceous gland prevents drying and keeps the skin smooth, whereas watery secretion of sweat gland keeps the skin surface cool by maintaining body temperature.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Sebaceous glands:</bold> Are present in the dermis except in palms and soles. It is simple branched alveolar gland with its duct opening into the hair follicle but it opens on the epidermal surface in the lips, glans penis and clitoris. According to the mode of secretion it is holocrine gland. The gland resembles a bunch of grapes; alveoli are filled with polyhedral cells containing fat droplets. These cells enlarge and burst to form sebum. The duct is lined by stratified squamous epithelium.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Sweat glands:</bold> Are present in the dermis and are of two types:
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Eccrine sweat glands</span> are present all over the body. They are simple coiled tubular and merocrine type. The secretory tubule is lined by simple cuboidal epithelium. Myoepithelial cells are present between cuboidal cells and basal lamina. The duct is lined by two layers of cuboidal cells (stratified cuboidal epithelium) and opens on the epithelial surface.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Apocrine sweat glands</span> are present in the axilla, external genitalia, anal region, areola and nipple of mammary gland. They are simple branched tubular and apocrine type. The duct opens into the hair follicle above the duct of sebaceous gland.</p></li></ol></p></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch10lev2sec3"><h2 class="title">Other Modified Glands of Skin</h2>
<p class="noindent">(i) Mammary gland, (ii) Ceruminous gland in external acoustic meatus, (iii) Gland of Moll in eyelids, (iv) Gland of Zeis in eyelids and (v) Tarsal or Meibomian gland in eyelids (i, ii, iii are modified sweat glands while iv and v are modified sebaceous glands).</p>
<div class="section" id="ch10lev3sec3"><h3 class="title">Hair</h3>
<p class="noindent">They are present everywhere except in the skin of palms, soles and some parts of genitalia. It has three parts:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li><p class=""><bold>Shaft</bold> which is visible.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Root</bold> which is embedded in the skin.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Bulb</bold> which is a bulbous expansion in the hypodermis or subcutaneous tissue. Its base is invaginated by subcutaneous tissue to form the hair papilla. The epidermis and dermis form a sheath around the hair, called hair follicle.<a name="page95"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">95</span></span></p></li>
</ol>
<p class="noindent">In a section hair presents three layers from within outside:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li><p class=""><bold>Medulla:</bold> It is present in the hair of scalp and in fine hair. It is composed of two or three layers of cornified polyhedral cells with air spaces in between cells.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Cortex:</bold> It is composed of several layers of cells, cuboidal in root but cornified in shaft. Cells contain pigment granules in colored races.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Cuticle:</bold> It is composed of a single layer of scale like cells arranged in overriding manner.</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="noindent">Hair follicles consist of two coats:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li><p class="">Inner coat derived from epidermis and presents inner epithelial root sheath having outer Henle's layer (single layer of cuboidal cells), middle Huxley's layer (number of rows of elongated cells containing granules) and cuticle of root sheath (same as cuticle layer of hair) and outer epithelial root sheath which is continuation of germinative zone of epidermis (stratum basale and stratum spinosum).</p></li>
<li><p class="">Outer coat derived from dermis and forms a connective tissue sheath.</p></li>
</ol>
<div class="section" id="ch10lev4sec1"><h4 class="title">Arrector pilorum muscle</h4>
<p class="noindent">It is smooth muscle present in the dermis and is attached to the outer coat of follicle.<a name="page96"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">96</span></span></p>

<div class="section" id="ch10lev2sec6"><h2 class="title">Clinical Correlation/Vertical Integration</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">In <bold>psoriasis,</bold> a common skin disease, there is an increase in the number of proliferating cells in the stratum basale and the stratum spinosum as well as a decrease in the cycle time of these cells. This results in greater epidermal thickness and more rapid renewal of epidermis.</p></li>
<li><p class="">In humans, lack of cortisol from the adrenal cortex causes overproduction of adrenocorticotropic hormone, which increases the pigmentation of the skin. An example of this is <bold>Addison disease,</bold> which is caused by dysfunction of the adrenal glands.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Albinism,</bold> a hereditary inability of the melanocytes to synthesize melanin, is caused by the absence of tyrosinase activity or the inability of cells to take up tyrosine. As a result, the skin is not protected from solar radiation by melanin, and there is a greater incidence of basal and squamous cell carcinomas (skin cancers).</p></li>
<li><p class="">The degeneration and disappearance of entire melanocytes result in a depigmentation disorder called <bold>vitiligo.</bold></p></li>
<li><p class="">Abnormalities of the dermal-epidermal junction can lead to one type of blistering disorder (<bold>bullous pemphigoid</bold>). Another type of blistering disorder (<bold>pemphigus</bold>) is caused by the loss of intercellular junctions between keratinocytes.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The elastin content of human skin increases approximately fivefold from fetal to adult life. In old age, extensive cross-linking of collagen fibers, the loss of elastic fibers, and degeneration of these fibers cause the skin to become more fragile, lose its suppleness, and develop wrinkles. The degeneration of elastic fibers is accelerated by excessive exposure to sunlight.</p></li>
<li><p class="">In several disorders, such as <bold>cutis laxa</bold> and <bold>Ehlers-Danlos syndromes</bold> there is a considerable increase in skin and ligament extensibility caused by defective collagen-fibril processing.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The flow of sebum is continuous, and a disturbance in the normal secretion and flow of sebum is one of the reasons for the development of acne, a chronic inflammation of obstructed sebaceous glands. It occurs mainly during puberty.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Tumors of the skin:</bold> In adults, one-third of all tumors are of the skin. Most of these tumors derive from the basal cells, the squamous cells of the stratum spinosum, and melanocytes. They produce, respectively, basal cell carcinomas, squamous cell carcinomas, and melanomas.</p>
<p class="indent">The first two types of tumors can be diagnosed and excised early and consequently are rarely lethal. Skin tumors show an increased incidence in fair-skinned individuals residing in regions with high amounts of solar radiation.</p>
<p class=""><bold>Malignant melanoma</bold> is an invasive tumor of melanocytes. Dividing rapidly, malignantly transformed melanocytes penetrate the basal lamina, enter the dermis, and invade the blood and lymphatic vessels to gain wide distribution throughout the body.</p></li>
