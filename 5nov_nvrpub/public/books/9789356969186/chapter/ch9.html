<p class="noindent">In this system there is a central pumping organ called ‘Heart’ and tubular channels called ‘Vessels’. The distributing vessels which carry blood from the heart to different parts of the body are called ‘arteries’ and the draining vessels which carry blood towards the heart from the different parts of body are called ‘veins’. The microscopic vessels connecting the smallest arteries (arterioles) and the smallest veins (venules) are called ‘capillaries’.</p>
<p class="noindent">Histologically there are three main types of blood vessels:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p class=""><bold>Arteries</bold>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li><p class="">Large or elastic artery</p></li>
<li><p class="">Medium sized or muscular artery</p></li>
<li><p class="">Smallest artery or arteriole</p></li></ol></p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Capillaries</bold></p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Veins</bold>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li><p class="">Smallest vein or venule</p></li>
<li><p class="">Medium sized vein</p></li>
<li><p class="">Large vein.</p></li></ol></p></li>
</ol>
</div><div class="section" id="ch9lev1sec2"><h1 class="title">STRUCTURE</h1>
<p class="noindent">All blood vessels have the same basic structure. Each vessel has three coats or tunics from within outwards:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li><p class=""><bold>Tunica intima:</bold> Consists of lining endothelium (simple squamous epithelium) and subendothelial connective tissue<a name="page82"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">82</span></span></p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Tunica media:</bold> Consists of smooth muscle fibers and connective tissue</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Tunica adventitia:</bold> Consists of fibroelastic connective tissue.</p></li>
</ol>
<div class="section" id="ch9lev2sec1"><h2 class="title">Large/Elastic/Conducting Artery</h2>
<p class="noindent">It is thick-walled and thickness of its wall is about one-tenth of the luminal diameter.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Tunica intima</bold> presents endothelium and subendothelial connective tissue. Subendothelium contains fibrocytes, macrophages and smooth muscle-like cells called myointimal cells. The fibers (collagen and elastic) are longitudinally oriented. Tunica intima is demarcated from tunica media by a poorly defined fenestrated internal elastic lamina.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Tunica media</bold> presents about 40–70 layers of fenestrated elastic laminae arranged circularly, hence the name elastic artery. Between elastic laminae, it contains smooth muscle cells and collagen fibers. The outermost elastic lamina is thickened and called external elastic lamina.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Tunica adventitia</bold> presents fibroelastic connective tissue containing small blood vessels (vasa vasorum) and unmyelinated nerve fibers.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent"><bold>For example:</bold> (1) Aorta and its branches and (2) Pulmonary trunk and its branches.</p>
<p class="indent">Towards old age, gradual changes take place like thickening of tunica intima and formation of fibro-fatty plaques in it, accumulation of lipid in the myointimal cells and macrophages and calcification of tunica media. These changes are described as atheroma or atherosclerosis resulting into gradual narrowing of the lumen. It involves coronary and cerebral arteries too leading into infarction and stroke respectively.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch9lev2sec2"><h2 class="title">Medium-sized/Muscular/Distributing Artery</h2>
<p class="noindent">Its wall thickness is about one-fourth of the luminal diameter.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Tunica intima</bold> presents endothelium and internal elastic lamina, no subendothelium. Internal elastic lamina shows wavy folds due to contraction of smooth muscle in the tunica media.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Tunica media</bold> presents mainly the smooth muscle cells arranged circularly (about 40 layers) hence the name muscular artery. It also contains collagen and elastic fibers intermixed with smooth muscle cells.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Tunica adventitia</bold> presents three parts: (i) Inner part shows more elastic fibers than collagen fibers and it includes external elastic lamina, (ii) Middle part has collagen and elastic fibers running longitudinally and (iii) Outer part has loose connective tissue that merges with the surrounding areolar tissue and contains vasa vasorum and unmyelinated nerve fibers.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent"><bold>For example:</bold> Branches of external carotid artery, radial and ulnar arteries etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch9lev2sec3"><h2 class="title">Arteriole</h2>
<p class="noindent">The small vessel having diameter less than 0.5 mm. Wall thickness is equal or more than the luminal diameter.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Tunica intima</bold> presents only endothelial lining, no subendothelium or internal elastic lamina.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Tunica media</bold> presents 1–5 layers of circularly arranged smooth muscle cells.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Tunica adventitia</bold> is thin and contains sympathetic nerve fibers that control the size of lumen by contracting the smooth muscle cells.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">The terminal branches of arterioles are called metarterioles. They have smaller lumen and only few smooth muscle cells.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch9lev2sec4"><h2 class="title">Capillaries</h2>
<p class="noindent">Arterioles break up into small vessels called capillaries. They are referred to as exchange vessels because they are involved in exchange of gases, nutrients and metabolites between blood and tissue. The lumen is about 7–9 µm.</p>
<p class="noindent"><bold>Tunica intima</bold> presents only 2–3 endothelial cells lining the lumen on cross section. Pericytes or adventitial cells are occasionally seen in the basement membrane of the endothelium and form the <bold>Tunica media</bold>. These cells contain contractile filaments in the cytoplasm. <bold>Tunica adventitia</bold> presents a thin layer of collagen fibers.</p>
<p class="noindent">Capillaries are of three types depending on the nature of endothelium:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li><p class=""><bold>Continuous/Somatic capillary:</bold> It is commonest type present in connective tissue, muscle, brain, lung, etc. The endothelial cells form a continuous lining of the capillary<a name="page83"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">83</span></span></p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Fenestrated/Visceral capillary:</bold> It presents tiny pores in the endothelial cells which take part in rapid exchange of substances between tissues and blood, e.g., Kidney, intestinal villi, endocrine glands, etc.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Sinusoidal capillary:</bold> It is present in liver and haemopoietic organs like red bone marrow and spleen. It is tortuous having irregular lumen (30–40 µm) which is lined by discontinuous endothelium. There are gaps between the endothelial cells that permit passage of blood cells. Phagocytic cells may be seen in the wall, e.g., Kupffer's cells in liver.</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch9lev2sec5"><h2 class="title">Venules</h2>
<p class="noindent">They receive blood from capillaries and have larger lumen (0.5–1 mm) than arterioles. They have a thin wall and a large collapsed lumen.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Tunica intima</bold> presents endothelium.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Tunica media</bold> presents one or two layers of smooth muscle cells.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Tunica adventitia</bold> presents a thick layer of connective tissue rich in collagen fibers.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch9lev2sec6"><h2 class="title">Medium-sized Veins</h2>

<li><p class=""><bold>Tunica adventitia</bold> presents a loose fibroelastic connective tissue containing vasa vasorum and nerve fibers.</p></li>

<div class="section" id="ch9lev2sec7"><h2 class="title">Large Veins</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Tunica intima</bold> well developed having endothelium and subendothelial connective tissue.</p></li>

<li><p class=""><bold>Tunica adventitia</bold> is well developed and thickest coat. It presents many longitudinal bundles of smooth muscle cells embedded in connective tissue.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Medium and large sized veins are often provided with valves to prevent the reflux of blood.</p></li>

<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">The endothelium also has an antithrombogenic action, preventing blood coagulation. When endothelial cells are damaged by atherosclerotic lesions, for example, the uncovered subendothelial connective tissue induces the aggregation of blood platelets. This aggregation initiates a cascade of events that produces fibrin from blood fibrinogen. An intravascular coagulum, or <bold>thrombus</bold> (plural, thrombi), is formed that may grow until there is complete obstruction of the local blood flow. From this thrombus, solid masses called <bold>emboli</bold> (singular, embolus) may detach and be carried by the blood to obstruct distant blood vessels. In both cases, the vascular flow may stop, a potentially life-threatening condition. Thus, the integrity of the endothelial layer, which prevents contact between platelets and the subendothelial connective tissue, is an important antithrombogenic mechanism.</p></li>
<li><p class="">In aging, the extracellular matrix is disordered by an increased secretion of collagen types I and III and of some glycosaminoglycans. Changes in the molecular conformation of elastin and other glycoproteins also occur and may facilitate deposition of <bold>lipoproteins</bold> and calcium ions in the tissue with subsequent calcification. Modifications of the components of the extracellular matrix associated with other more complex factors may lead to the formation of an <bold>atherosclerotic plaque.</bold></p></li>
<li><p class="">Arteries undergo progressive and gradual changes from birth to death, and it is difficult to say where the normal growth processes end and the processes of involution begin. Each artery exhibits its own aging pattern.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Atherosclerotic lesions are characterized by focal thickening of the intima, proliferation of smooth muscle cells and increased deposition of extracellular connective tissue elements, and lipoproteins in the subendothelial layer. Monocytes are attracted to these areas where they differentiate into macrophages characterized by the extensive uptake of atherogenic lipoproteins by receptor-mediated endocytosis. When heavily loaded with lipid, these cells are referred to as <bold>foam cells</bold> and form the macroscopically visible fatty streaks and plaques that characterize <bold>atherosclerosis.</bold> These changes may extend to the inner part of the tunica media, and the thickening may become so great as to occlude the vessel. Coronary arteries are among those most predisposed to atherosclerosis. Uniform thickening of the intima is believed to be a normal phenomenon of aging.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Some arteries irrigate only specific areas of certain organs, and obstruction of the blood supply results in <bold>necrosis</bold> (death of tissues from a lack of metabolites). These <bold>infarcts</bold> commonly occur in the heart, kidneys, cerebrum, and certain other organs. In other regions (such as the skin), arteries anastomose frequently, and the obstruction of one artery does not lead to tissue necrosis, because the blood flow is maintained.</p></li>
<li><p class="">When the media of an artery is weakened by an embryonic defect, disease, or lesion, the wall of the artery may dilate extensively. Progression of this process of dilatation leads to the development of an <bold>aneurysm.</bold> Rupture of the aneurysm brings severe consequences and may cause death.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Junctions between endothelial cells of venules are the loosest. At these locations there is a characteristic loss of fluid from the circulatory system during the inflammatory response, leading to edema.</p></li>
