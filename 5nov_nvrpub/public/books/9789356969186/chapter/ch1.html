The term microanatomy is used synonymously with the term “Histology” which is derived from the Greek word, ‘histos’ (which means web or tissue) and logos (which means study). It is the branch of biology which studies the microscopic anatomy of biological tissues and is the microscopic counterpart to gross anatomy.</p><p class="noindent"><bold>Importance of microanatomy:</bold> (i) The physiology and functional anatomy can be understood only after gaining the knowledge of the structure of that cell (ii) The understanding of microanatomy forms the basis for interpretation of pathological slides showing abnormalities in the cell structure.</p><p class="noindent"><bold>Microanatomy techniques:</bold> Processing of tissues is done to obtain thin translucent sections to examine under microscope under following steps:</p><div class="informalfigure"><img alt="" src="/MediumImage/1-1.jpg"></div><ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Fixation:</bold> This procedure is done to preserve the morphology and chemical composition of the tissue, to prevent autolysis and putrefaction, to harden tissue for section cutting and to influence staining. Small pieces of fresh tissues are placed in a common fixative like 10% formalin for 24 hours. Each fixative has desirable and undesirable effects so a combination of fixatives is used to get maximum desirable effects. Other commonly used fixatives are Bouin's fluid (formalin, acetic acid and picric acid), Formal sublimate, Helly's fluid, Zenker's fluid, etc.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Dehydration:</bold> This is done in order to embed the tissue in paraffin wax (which is not miscible in water) by immersing it in ascending grades of alcohol (i.e., 50%, 70%, 90%) and absolute alcohol (30 to 60 minutes in each depending on the consistency of tissue).<a name="page2"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">2</span></span></p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Clearing:</bold> This is done to remove alcohol from tissue by immersing in a clearing agent like xylene or toluene for 2–3 hours.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Embedding:</bold> This procedure is done to give a rigid consistency to the tissue and in order to obtain thin sections with microtomes. The tissue is impregnated in molten paraffin wax in a wax bath for 2 hours with three changes and then casting or block making is done by using ‘L’ (Leuckhart's) mold.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Section cutting (Microtomy):</bold> In this procedure, 5–7 µm thick sections are cut from the block with a rotary microtome. The sections are flattened over warm water and affixed to albuminised glass slides after that. The slides are then air dried or dried in an incubator overnight at 37°C and finally stored for staining at room temperature.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Staining:</bold> In this procedure, the sections are stained most commonly, by using a basic and an acidic dye (hematoxylin and eosin respectively). Special stains like Periodic Acid Schiff (PAS), Osmic acid, Mallory and Masson's Trichome are used for staining of selective tissue components. Steps of staining are: (i) Deparaffinization which includes, treating the slide with xylol by three changes of 3–5 minutes, (ii) Hydration: by a series of changes in descending grades of alcohol (absolute alcohol-5 minutes (two changes), 90% alcohol-3 minutes, 70% alcohol-3 minutes, 50% alcohol-3 minutes) and distilled water-3 minutes, (iii) Staining with hematoxylin: 5–7 minutes, washing in running tap water until the section becomes blue, differentiation with 1% acid alcohol for 5 seconds, washing in running tap water again until the section becomes blue, staining with 1% eosin for 1 minute and (iv) Dehydration by a series of changes in 50% alcohol-10 seconds, 70% alcohol-10 seconds, 90% alcohol-30 seconds and absolute alcohol-5 minutes of two changes.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Mounting:</bold> Finally, the slides are mounted (after clearing by xylene) in DPX (Dibutylphthalate Polystyrene Xylene which is a mixture of distyrene, a plasticizer, and xylene) or Canada balsam with the help of a cover slip.</p></li>

<p class="noindent">It is an <bold>instrument used to magnify the size of objects, that are too small to be seen by the naked eye</bold>. There are many types of microscopes, the most common microscope (and the first to be invented) is the optical microscope, which uses light to pass through a sample to produce an image. Other major types of microscopes are the fluorescence microscope, the electron microscope (both the transmission electron microscope and the scanning electron microscope) and the various types of scanning probe microscope. Optical/Light microscope is an indispensable instrument for microanatomy.</p>

<p class="indent"><a name="page3"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">3</span></span>It consists of a joint having a foot or base on which is fastened an arm. At the upper end of arm is attached a body tube which is movable up and down with the help of fine and coarse adjustments. Eyepiece or ocular and a revolving nosepiece with objectives are the two sets of lenses at the upper and lower ends of body tube respectively. There are usually 3–4 objectives of different magnifications of low and high powers (10X, 40X, 100X, etc.). Similarly, lenses of different magnifications can be used (5x, 8x, 10x, etc.). At the lower end of the arm, is fastened a stage or platform which is perforated at its center. Below the stage, is provided a substage containing a condenser, iris diaphragm and a plane cum concave mirror for low and high power objectives to reflect and adjust the light respectively. The source of illumination may be natural or artificial lamp. The arrangement is such that light travels through the specimen via the objective first followed by the eyepiece and finally reaches the eye where the image is formed.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch1lev2sec1"><h2 class="title">General Rules to Use Microscope</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li><p class="">Wipe the mirror and stage with soft cotton cloth before use.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Focus under low power objective first.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Do not touch the lenses with fingers and never clean them with handkerchief.</p></li>
<li><p class="">During setting the slide on the stage, cover slip of the slide should face up otherwise focusing with high power will not be possible and attempting to do so may break the slide.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Use fine and coarse adjustments knobs carefully.</p></li>

<p class="noindent"><bold>A cell is a unit of a living material,</bold> capable of living independently in a favorable surrounding (capable to draw nutrition, to synthesize substances required and to multiply by division).</p>
<p class="indent">Cells are structural and functional units held together by the intercellular junctions and matrix to form tissues, organs and systems of the body.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="">There are four basic types of tissues: (i) Epithelial, (ii) Connective, (iii) Muscular and (iv) Nervous.</p>

<p class="indent"><a name="page4"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">4</span></span>For light microscope, the measurement unit micrometer (μm) is now used instead of micron (µ). For electron microscope it is nanometer (nm) instead of Angstrom (A). Average size of cells ranges from 10 to 20 µm.</p>
<p class="indent">1 micrometer or micron (µm) = 1/1000 millimeter (mm)</p>
<p class="indent">1 nanometer (nm) = 1/1000 micrometer</p>
<p class="noindent">Generally, the size of RBC is taken as standard. Average size of some of the cells is as follows:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>RBC or erythrocyte:</bold> 7.5 µm</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Mature human ovum:</bold> 120 to 130 µm</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Nerve cell:</bold> 4 to 160 µm</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Smooth muscle cell:</bold> 0.02 to 0.5 mm (length)</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Skeletal muscle cell:</bold> May be as long as 30 cm</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">Shape of the cells may be squamous, cuboidal, columnar and polyhedral.</p>
<p class="indent">A cell has a living material called protoplasm which is enclosed in a plasma membrane or cell membrane. The cell membrane is made up predominantly of lipids, but proteins and carbohydrates are also present. The protoplasm consists of water, organic substances (amino acids, proteins, carbohydrates, lipid and nucleic acids, etc.) and inorganic ions. Water is nearly 70% of cell volume. In the protoplasm lies the nucleus and the rest of protoplasm is called the cytoplasm.</p>
<p class="noindent">The <bold>Cytoplasm</bold> contains:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Watery solution of salts and substances.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Organelles</span> or various work houses, e.g., ribosomes, granular or rough surfaced endoplasmic reticulum and agranular or smooth surfaced endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi bodies, mitochondria; vesicles like phagosomes, lysosomes, centrioles and cytoskeleton including microfilament and microtubules.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Inclusions</span> which are of temporary nature metabolic or ingested, e.g., glycogen, lipids, pigments (exogenous and endogenous) and enzymes. Cytoplasm is generally acidophilic and so stains reddish with eosin.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">The <bold>Nucleus</bold> contains nuclear membrane, chromatin, nucleolus and nuclear sap. It is generally basophilic (due to nucleic acids of DNA and RNA) and so stains bluish with hematoxylin. Chromatin is the physiological state of chromosomes in the resting or non-dividing state of the cell. Nucleus is seen in one of the three states of chromatin: (i) <span class="italic">Heterochromatic</span> or darkly stained (in resting cell when chromosomes are in coiled or condensed form), (ii) <span class="italic">Euchromatic</span> or granular (in active cell chromosomes are partly coiled and partly uncoiled form, here coiled part takes staining giving granular appearance) and (iii) <span class="italic">Vesicular</span> or pale (in hyperactive cell like nerve cell, when chromosomes are uncoiled or in extended form and so do not take staining).<a name="page5"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">5</span></span></p>
