<p class="noindent">I am delighted to write the Foreword for the second edition of the book titled “<span class="italic">Manual of Histology</span>”. I am really impressed with the layout of each chapter which includes a precise background knowledge about the microscopic anatomy of various cells, tissues and organs of human body followed by the systematically arranged sequence of various histological diagrams for practice of first year MBBS students, based on the new CBME pattern. The book provides specific student-centric information in a concise manner. It is my hope and expectation that this book will provide an effective learning experience for MBBS, BDS, BSc Nursing, BPT and BOT students.</p>

<p class="noindent">This book has been designed for the MBBS, BDS, BPT, BOT, and BSc Nursing students to give them precise information about each tissue and organ at the beginning of each chapter along with corresponding histological diagrams to be drawn by the students thereafter, which helps in increasing their cognitive, affective, and psychomotor skills. Although manual practical files are being prescribed to MBBS students in almost all medical colleges across India, there is scarcity of books which provide the key points of identification along with standard reference diagrams. This book is based on the competencies mentioned in the Competency-Based Medical Education (CBME) for histology curriculum. The students are required to make all diagrams under 100× magnification with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) stain.</p>
<p class="indent">Histology is the foundation of pathology. Many books on histology, written by illustrious and distinguished authors, have greatly enriched the medical science. The subject of Anatomy is very extensive in medical core curriculum and all aspects of Human Anatomy have to be covered in a very short duration. The major portion of the curriculum focusses on Gross Anatomy giving little time for the histological aspect. Although the practical importance of histology cannot be ignored, still, in the current scenario, there is dearth of books which aid and guide undergraduate students on this aspect with a simple approach.</p>
<p class="indent">We are thankful to the legend of Anatomy and author of various reputed academic books “Dr Krishna Garg” for her able guidance and support throughout. We are grateful to the whole team of M/s Jaypee Brothers Medical Publishers (P) Ltd, New Delhi, who have converted our dream into reality.</p>
<p class="indent">This book may not be exhaustive in its coverage of the subject, but it has highlighted all important histological features required for identification of histological slides by undergraduate medical students. We hope that this book creates a firm foundation of histological principles that anybody can build upon.</p>

<p class="noindent">This book has been designed especially for the first year MBBS, BDS, BPT, BOT and BSc Nursing students to give them precise information about each tissue and organ at the beginning of a particular chapter followed by its practice by the students which reinforces the knowledge acquired by the student as well as increases their cognitive skills. The students are required to make all diagrams under 100x magnification with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) stain. Although manual practical files are being made by first year MBBS students in almost all medical colleges across India, but there is scarcity of books which provide the key points of identification along with standard reference diagrams.
