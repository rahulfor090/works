Any quest for truth, be it science or spirituality, is a passionate activity, a type of madness, because the material rewards are negligible in comparison with the effort involved. We have already learnt something about the method in the madness called research (<a href="/9788184484175/chapter/ch18" class="ulink-exter">Chapter 18</a>). Is there a method for going about the spiritual quest too, how does this method compare with the scientific method, and what is the relationship between the scientific and spiritual views of truth? These are some of the questions that will be discussed in this chapter.</p><div class="section" id="ch20lev1sec1"><h1 class="title">THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD</h1>
<p>Science has a fairly well-defined method for going about its business of answering endless questions about the cause and effect relationships in the universe. The beginning of every piece of scientific research is a question. The scientist usually also has a hunch about what the answer to his question is likely to be. This answer forms the basis of a hypothesis. Then the scientist formulates a hypothesis-driven plan for his experiments.</p>
<p>The experimental design takes every possible care to minimize the factors which might confound the results. The confounding factors which cannot be avoided are taken care of by having appropriate controls. In the study itself, the emphasis is on accurate, unbiased observations. The observations are made basically with the help of sense organs, although the capacity of the sense organs may be enormously magnified or extended by means of appropriate equipment.</p>
<p>All attempts are made to express the data in figures, which are then subjected to statistical analysis. Statistical tools not only help in organizing complex data, but also facilitate objective and dispassionate <a name="page287"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">287</span></span>interpretation of results. Statistical tests yield only probabilities, not definitive conclusions. For example, if the significance level of the results is less than 0.05, it means that the probability is less than 5% that the results are due to chance. In other words, the probability is more than 95% that the results represent the truth. Since the conclusions are not definitive, they are expressed in cautious, guarded and tentative language. Further, the conclusions are open to revision if future studies warrant it. This openness to revision, this self-imposed vulnerability, is the greatest strength of science. And revisions there have been many in science, in spite of the objectivity of observations. This happens because observations are valid only for a certain set of conditions. If the conditions of the experiment change as a result of further refinement of the design, or due to improvement in the equipment available, the observations may change. Further, although observations are always true, their interpretation is open to revision. Thus science, in its search for truth, is constantly striving for a better approximation to truth. It is never sure whether it has finally arrived at the truth.</p>
<p>This is the standard method by which science continues its slow march towards better understanding of the universe. However, there are innumerable instances of breakthroughs having come from studies in which the scientist intuitively made a radical departure from the prescribed procedure.</p>
<p>The notion of a unique scientific method has received a good deal of battering at the hands of Thomas Kuhn (Kuhn 1962) and his colleague Paul Feyerabend (Feyerabend 1975). However, two basic principles continue to be the bedrock of science. First, observations are ideally made in such a way that the observer should not matter. That is, the observation should be the same irrespective of the observer: this is objectivity. Second, there is no dogma or authoritarianism in science. If a novice comes up with facts which challenge an established theory on the basis of experiments which are more convincing than those on which the theory was based, the theory will be revised. This does not mean that scientists are always dispassionate about ideas which they have cherished for long as truths. After all, scientists are also human beings and can therefore be partial to their own ideas. But their commitment to the basic principles of science ensures that they defend their position by appealing to facts and reason, not on the basis of their age, position or authority.<a name="page288"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">288</span></span></p>
</div><div class="section" id="ch20lev1sec2"><h1 class="title">METHOD IN SPIRITUALITY</h1>
<p>The method of spiritual seekers is broadly similar to that of the scientists, but there are some fundamental differences. Unlike science, spirituality is concerned with only a few basic existential questions. These questions are concerned with the ‘why’ rather than the ‘hows’ of the universe, and with the relationship between the individual, the manifest universe and the Absolute Reality, if any. Although disciplines such as yoga provide guidelines for facilitating inquiry into these questions, there is no set method which the seeker must follow. Yoga is an omnibus term which has included from time to time a variety of goals and approaches. There have been alternating trends towards extremes of specialization and synthesis (Aurobindo 1970a). In yoga, there is room for adopting methods lying anywhere along the wide spectrum ranging from total surrender to persistent effort, from asceticism to total immersion in worldly pursuits. The only tools common to the efforts of all the spiritual seekers who have achieved a modicum of success in their search are total sincerity, an extreme degree of self-purification, and intense concentration. What sets spiritual quest clearly apart from scientific exploration, however, is that the spiritual seeker himself is his experimental subject, and he himself is his laboratory. The experiment essentially consists of looking within. Since the observation is made by looking within, it is in the form of a non-sensory experience. The consistent result of these unique experiments is self-discovery. The discovery consists in realizing (not just knowing) the fundamental unity of the individual self, the universal Self, and the transcendental Self.</p>
<p>All three are interconnected expressions of the single Absolute Reality. ‘Seeing’ the spirit of the same Reality in the multiple and diverse forms of manifestation is the core of the spiritual experience. However, the ‘seeing’ is not with the eyes, or for that matter, with any of the sense organs. Therefore, the limitations of language, which handicap the description of even sensory experiences, become far more real in case of spiritual experiences. That is one reason why many mystics choose not to describe the experience at all. Those who do make an attempt confess that they are trying to describe that which is actually beyond description. However, one thing which they are all sure about is that the experience is genuine, and that the answers it has given them to existential questions are beyond any doubt. This air of finality, this confidence and certainty, is in sharp contrast with the tentative nature of scientific conclusions. What is paradoxical is that this certainty is not supported by any proof. Proof consists of <a name="page289"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">289</span></span>objective evidence, which is obviously not possible here because the conclusion is based on subjective experience. Only the observer can attest the veracity of his observations. For every experiment which leads to experiential observations, n = 1. Therefore, statistical treatment is out of the question. Further, spiritual seeking is an experiment which would interest very few at any point in time. But the interesting thing is that over thousands of years, thousands of seekers have recorded their experiences. These seekers belong to different periods in history, and cut across geographical, linguistic, racial and religious lines. In spite of such wide differences in background, their descriptions of the mystical experience are remarkably similar (Huxley 1945). This remarkable agreement constitutes an evidence of sorts. But the fact remains that in science, there is proof but no certainty; in spirituality, there is certainty but no proof.</p>
<p>Replication of spiritual experiments is permissible but, as in science, the sceptic should use the same tools as the previous investigator. These tools, principally, are intense self-purification and concentration. Although these tools are available to all, few are willing to put in the effort required for acquiring them. Therefore, most of us are content to admire, and revere, the long line of <span class="italic">rishis,</span> seers and mystics who have subjected themselves to these rigorous experiments in pursuit of the whole Truth.</p>
<p>Because of the moral purification required of a spiritual seeker, spiritual quest has a transforming influence. There are ethical considerations in scientific research also (<a href="/9788184484175/chapter/ch16" class="ulink-exter">Chapters 16</a> and <a href="/9788184484175/chapter/ch17" class="ulink-exter">17</a>). However, a scientist might flout some of these considerations, and still survive, even thrive, as a scientist. But if a spiritual seeker does not sincerely purify his thoughts, words and deeds, he can forget about self-realization.</p>
</div><div class="section" id="ch20lev1sec3"><h1 class="title">A COMPARATIVE VIEW</h1>
<p>In spite of the superficial similarity between science and spirituality, there are some fundamental differences which emanate from their contrasting worldviews. To science, only that which can be perceived by the senses is real, only that which is logical is plausible, and only that which is supported by experimental evidence is valid. The spiritual worldview accepts as real everything that is real to science, but considers it a lower level of reality because it is neither constant nor permanent. However, the core of the spiritual worldview is an unchanging and imperishable Absolute Reality. Further, it believes that the spirit of the Absolute Reality pervades all scientific reality <a name="page290"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">290</span></span>and also extends beyond it. Spirituality respects reason as a tool, but also recognizes its limitations. Further, it believes in sources of knowledge better than reason which emanate from planes of consciousness higher than the mental. Accordingly, the questions in science concern the physical universe. The goal of science is to understand the physical universe, unravel the laws which govern the universe, and to use this knowledge to master nature. In contrast, although spirituality does not deny the physical universe, its questions concern primarily the supraphysical. The goal of spirituality is to realize the supraphysical Reality, and to use this realization for self-mastery. The presupposition that guides science is naturalism. Naturalism may be defined as the assumption that “there is no need to posit forces outside the natural realm to explain natural phenomena” (Marcum 2003). Naturalism has served science well, and the progress which science has made while staying within the framework of naturalism has been indeed remarkable. So overwhelming has been the spell which science has cast over the worldview of the modern man that some of the brightest minds (see, e.g. Pearson 1892, Feynman 1985) now subscribe to a presupposition which has been called metaphysical naturalism. Metaphysical naturalism is the presupposition that “physical or material phenomena are all there is” (Marcum 2003). In other words, if a phenomenon does not fit into the framework of science, the phenomenon does not exist. This attitude makes science as dogmatic as some of the traditional religions. It is an irony that modern science, which had its roots in the rebellion against religious dogma, has itself become dogmatic. The unscientific attitude of science is reflected in the way it handles non-material phenomena. It rejects God, spiritual experience and superconsciousness. The rejection is based on the illogical assumption that absence of proof constitutes proof of absence. However, science does not reject the mind but considers it to be a product of neuronal activity. Thus the mind, which is a non-material entity, is ‘explained’ in terms of the activity of the brain, which is a material entity. Thus the ‘mind’ is also somehow made to fit into the framework of science. However, the fact is that science is completely ignorant about the link between the mind and neuronal activity. In the sensory limb of the nervous system, scientists know how information about the existence of a sensory stimulus is transmitted to certain areas of the brain. The pathways of transmission and the neurotransmitters involved are known in detail. But how neuronal activity in sensory areas of the brain is converted into a sensory experience is something science still does not know. In the <a name="page291"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">291</span></span>motor limb, scientists know in considerable detail the pathway from the brain up to the point where neural activity is translated into muscular activity. But how the initial thought about moving a part of the body is generated, and how it is converted into activity of the motor areas of the brain are things about which science knows nothing. The link between the mind and neuronal activity is possibly a phenomenon which repeats, on a miniature scale, the process by which the non-material Supreme Consciousness chose to limit itself and manifest as the physical universe. This hypothesis leads to two corollaries. First, in the link between the mind and the brain, the mind is not an emergent property of the brain as assumed by science. Rather, mind is the primary entity, and brain is secondary. Thus brain is the utilizer of consciousness, not its generator (Sri Aurobindo 1970b). Secondly, the link between the mind and the brain cannot be understood entirely in terms of physical or mechanistic explanations to which conventional science is restricted. Understanding this link would require the type of vision which enables mystics to see the unmanifest Supreme Consciousness in the manifest universe.</p>

<p>Do the differences between science and spirituality mean that the two should be kept in separate compartments? In fact, the notion that the two can be separated is erroneous because the spiritual worldview includes the material universe. Since science gives us a <a name="page292"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">292</span></span>better understanding of the material universe, the spiritual worldview includes the scientific worldview. However, there is a widespread tendency to consider spirituality to be an other-worldly pursuit which merely tolerates physical existence as a necessary evil. That is why, the <span class="italic">Isha Upanishad (Verse 9)</span> warns that although those who are ignorant live in darkness, those who devote themselves only to knowledge live in still greater darkness. Here knowledge refers to knowledge of the Absolute Reality and its all-pervasive Spirit. Those who are ignorant of this knowledge believe that the physical universe is all there is. Thus they reject the Reality behind the universe. But there is always a possibility that one day they will know that there is something beyond the physical. On the other hand, those who have the knowledge of the non-material Absolute Reality, and consider it to be all there is, are in a greater darkness because of two reasons. First, they also reject a part of the Reality. If the Absolute Reality is real, its physical manifestation cannot be unreal. Secondly, they are under the illusion that they know everything there is to be known. Therefore, not only is their knowledge partial, even the possibility of removing their ignorance is ruled out. That is why their darkness is greater than that of the ignorant. In short, spirituality does not reject the world. A major contribution of great thinkers and visionaries of the 19th and 20th century such as Swami Vivekananda, Mahatma Gandhi and Sri Aurobindo was to reiterate this ancient but forgotten truth. An unbroken strand throughout Sri Aurobindo's voluminous writings is that since the world is not an illusion but a manifestation of the Divine, the world should not be rejected but transformed.</p>
<p>While the spiritual worldview includes the scientific worldview, science can afford to distance itself from spirituality, as it has done during the last few centuries. But the consequences of this attitude have not been entirely desirable for humanity. The exclusive preoccupation with the material universe characteristic of science promotes control of nature for material gains. This has led to environmental degradation, consumerism, exploitation and wars. A little reflection reveals that the majority of scientists work for either the industry or the military, directly or indirectly. Thus, although science is considered value-free, scientists end up working towards the promotion of many negative values in society. Therefore “it is imperative that our tendencies towards control, manipulation and violence – which science reflects and supports – be kept in check by the unitive understanding of human beings with respect to other beings at all levels, and with the whole of Nature, subtle and gross” (Ravindra <a name="page293"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">293</span></span>2000). The ‘unitive understanding’ is a part of the spiritual worldview. And belief in the spiritual worldview does not necessarily need Self-realisation, which will be rare anywhere at any point of time. Belief in the spiritual worldview is deeply ingrained in India. Even an illiterate Indian does not need much prompting to tell us that God is everywhere, and resides in everyone and everything. That is why in spite of being materially poorer, the ‘happiness index’ of Indians compares favourably with that of the westerners whose native spirituality has been eclipsed by the objects of desire brought to them by science and technology.</p>
<p>It may be agreed that science and spirituality are quite compatible with each other, and that their interaction is desirable for human welfare, but the question arises whether they will meet. Time seems to be ripe for such a meeting. The success of the scientific enterprise over the last few centuries has changed our lives at a pace unprecedented in human history. This has made scientific validation of any area of enquiry a matter of prestige, almost a condition for its acceptance. The spiritual masters have also not been aloof to the changing world. For instance, His Holiness the Dalai Lama has engaged personally in dialogue with scientists and promoted research into Buddhist meditative practices (Mehrotra 2005). The tools of science may not only be inadequate but also inappropriate for investigating spiritual questions or experiences. But the openness of spiritual masters to science encourages interaction and dialogue. Now let us look at the attitude of scientists. While science has been highly successful, it has of late also made discoveries which have forced it to take a look at spiritual truths. The relativistic models and theories of modern physics are all “impressive illustrations of the two basic elements of the Eastern worldview – the basic oneness of the universe and its intrinsically dynamic character” (Capra 1991). In medicine also, the rediscovery and scientific validation of the mind-body relationship has led to a paradigm shift which has made medical science open to the mind-body approaches of spiritual disciplines (Bijlani 2003). Thus science is also shedding its arrogance and is receptive to spiritual insights. With science and spirituality both ready to look at each other in a receptive mood, the hour of a grand creative synthesis seems to be near. Nothing could be better for the future of our planet.</p>
