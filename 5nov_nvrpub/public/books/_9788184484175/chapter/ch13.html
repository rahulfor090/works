In that sense, ‘thesis work’ is a hands-on introduction to research. Therefore, irrespective of the topic of research, the value of thesis work lies in cultivating the right way to think about a research project and to execute it. Thesis work is also good training in organization. A large number and variety of activities have to be coordinated over a long period of time with the aim of having the final product ready by a fixed date. Some of these activities have to be done by the research worker himself; for many others he is dependent on others. Funding, supplies of reagents and equipment, availability of subjects or patients, typing, statistical analysis, and correction of written material by the guide, are only some of the factors on which the student has, at best, only partial control. Juggling so many variables which can affect the rate at which the project moves needs total involvement and sound commonsense. Two important parts of the strategy are flexibility and thinking ahead. Flexibility allows something to go on even if something else is stuck. For example, if patients are not available, analysis of samples collected from an older set of subjects can still be done. If nothing else is possible, at least collection of references or writing of the review of literature can be done. Any time utilized properly makes things more comfortable <a name="page184"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">184</span></span>near the deadline. Thinking ahead means the foresight to calculate when the completion of various jobs is likely to be critical, and dividing the jobs into those which the student can do himself, and those for which he is dependent on somebody else. The first priority should be given to making others busy. For example, if the choice is between writing the Methods and Results, it is better to first tabulate the Results and give them to the statistician, and then write the Methods for which nobody else's assistance is required. Similarly, instead of polishing the whole thesis before giving it to the guide for correction, it is better to write a section of 10-12 pages, have it in a presentable form, and give it to the guide. The next 10-12 pages can be written and prepared while the guide is busy correcting what is already with him. In short, others have to be given adequate time. They may not be able or willing to keep everything else aside for the sake of your thesis. But what you have to yourselves do can wait because you will somehow keep all else aside, work day and night if necessary, and complete the job.</p><p>A thesis, besides being a piece of research, is also a form of writing. Therefore, the general principles of good writing apply also to thesis writing. The first pre-requisite for writing anything is that the author should know his subject well. No amount of writing skill can replace the mastery of the subject. Having learnt the subject, the next important pre-requisite is to know the audience, or the readership. The same subject has to be written very differently for the specialists, lay adults and children. Keeping the principal readership in mind, the author ‘speaks’ in an appropriate voice. The principal readership of the thesis consists of experts who may know the subject better than the author, and the aim of writing is to demonstrate that a reasonable amount of worthwhile research has been accomplished intelligently by the author. This is, in a way, a happy situation because the author can use technical jargon freely without the need to explain it. At the same time, however, the writing should be clear, unambiguous and lucid. The secret of good writing is rewriting. The first time something is written, the author feels he has done a great job. But if he reads his own work after a month, he finds it difficult to understand, and wants to rephrase and rearrange many bits and chunks. Therefore, it is a good idea to let the first draft cool for some time before picking it up for revision. During the revision, the changes may consist of:<a name="page185"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">185</span></span></p><ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>rearrangement of the sequence of some sections or paragraphs,</p></li>
<li><p>rephrasing for removing ambiguities,<a href="#ch13fn1" class="ulink-inter">1</a></p></li>
<li><p>correcting grammatical mistakes,</p></li>
<li><p>breaking long sentences into shorter and clearer sentences,</p></li>
<li><p>replacing difficult words by simple and commonly used words, provided they can convey the meaning well, and</p></li>
<li><p>substituting words which convey more exactly what you mean for slightly inappropriate words. For example, get, bring, fetch, secure, obtain, acquire, achieve and accomplish are similar words but cannot be used interchangeably. If you feel that the word you have used does not mean exactly what you want to say, but cannot think of the right word, consult a thesaurus: Roget's Thesaurus is probably the best.<sup><a href="#ch13fn2" class="ulink-inter">2</a></sup></p></li>
</ol><p>After you are fully satisfied with your writing, let some other competent person(s) work on it, including your guide. This is important because there will be defects which you cannot see but others will. As one of my teachers, Prof. N.K. Bhide, put it, “beyond a point, you cannot shave your own skull: you need a barber to do it.”</p><p>Repeated revisions are necessary not only for the beginner but also for accomplished writers. The novel which you can race through effortlessly overnight is the result of enormous effort on the part of the author, and generally also a few editors. As a wag has put it, easy writing makes hard reading; easy reading takes hard writing.</p><div class="section" id="ch13lev1sec1"><h1 class="title">SELECTING THE TOPIC OF RESEARCH</h1>
<p>The first step towards the thesis is selection of the topic for research. Since thesis work is time-bound, realistic considerations are far more important than romantic ideas. It is best to choose a topic closely related to the previous research of the guide. That ensures ready availability of equipment and reagents.</p>

<p><a name="page186"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">186</span></span>The techniques are well-established and there are many people available in the department to teach these to the ‘fresher’. The topic should be well-circumscribed so that the work can be finished within the time available. Further, the topic should be such that the results would have some significance irrespective of whether they are positive or negative.</p>
<p>Although these guidelines are more important for an MD or MSc thesis, they apply also to a PhD thesis.</p>
</div><div class="section" id="ch13lev1sec2"><h1 class="title">WORKING ON THE THESIS</h1>
<p>Every project requires for its successful completion working simultaneously on several fronts. With respect to thesis work, that means two broad fronts: experimental work and writing. Since this chapter is primarily about writing, we shall leave the experimental work here, and concentrate on what can be done at an early stage regarding writing. At an early stage, the most fruitful thing to do is to collect references and read them. This part of the work can be done rather efficiently through the internet. Use any search engine like Google or Yahoo to go to PubMed. In PubMed, a search may be made on the basis of some key words in the topic of research. For some topics, the references may run in several thousands, and it may be impractical to read all of them. In such a situation, three things can be done. First, the search may be restricted by adding a few more words. For example, instead of searching under ‘Breast Cancer’, one may search under ‘Breast Cancer and Estrogen Receptors’. Secondly, one may concentrate on recent references: important older references will be available in these as cross references. Thirdly, one may glance through the titles, look at the abstracts of the papers that seem relevant, and after looking at the abstracts, make a further selection of the most relevant papers for a thorough study. Further, it is also important that the fruits of this labour are preserved. Build up a system for preserving a personal collection of useful references. Computers have made this easier, but it still needs hard work and organizational skills to store material in an easily retrievable form. Probably it is still best to keep the printouts or photocopies of the most relevant papers in suitably classified files. Equally important is to create a file for ‘Bibliography’ in the computer, and type in it all references likely to be useful for reading or citing. Each reference should be typed <span class="italic">completely,</span> in exactly the format in which it has to go in the thesis. The best format to use is the one currently followed by all major biomedical journals such as <span class="italic">NEJM, Lancet</span> and <span class="italic">BMJ</span> (they have all agreed on a common format), unless your university has prescribed a different format. There may be a temptation to note down the reference in a <a name="page187"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">187</span></span>sketchy manner and complete it later, if and when necessary. But shedding a little laziness at this stage will save a lot of frantic and frustrating search at a later stage when time will be truly scarce. The dictum should be that no mechanical work like searching for a reference should be necessary more than once. Further, a new reference should be added to the existing list at the appropriate place so that the list is in alphabetic order by the first author's name. Finally, to stay insured against the accidental loss of computer data, everything that matters should be copied on CDs or a pen-drive which should be labeled, well-organised and periodically updated.</p>
</div><div class="section" id="ch13lev1sec3"><h1 class="title">WRITING UP THE THESIS</h1>
<p>Let us jump to the stage at which the data collection is complete, and all that needs to be done is to write up the thesis. A typical thesis has an arrangement somewhat like that shown in the accompanying box. It is good to get well in advance further details from the university, and also to keep handy a previously approved thesis as a guide. The chapter-opening quote may be humorous and cynical, but has a grain of truth in it.</p>

<div class="section" id="ch13lev2sec1"><h2 class="title">Review of Literature</h2>
<p>Unless the student has been very busy with course work, at least part of the review of literature should be ready by the time data collection <a name="page188"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">188</span></span>is complete.<sup><a href="#ch13fn3" class="ulink-inter">3</a></sup> The literature survey in a thesis is pretty exhaustive, covering the subject and its ramifications from several angles. However, exhaustive does not mean that the review should be a compendium of all the references available, a sentence or two from each, put together in a reasoned sequence. Instead, the review should be a critical synthesis, which can come only from a thorough study of the literature <span class="italic">and reflection.</span> Unless there is a special reason for elaborating upon an individual study, it is better to write a more meaningful and informative sentence followed by a bunch of references on which the sentence is based. For certain types of synthesis of information, a Table may be the ideal format. A few columns may summarise what was done and what was found, and the last column may give the relevant reference. Controversies may also be summarised in Tables, categorizing studies in terms of their results. You may give a quantitative flavour to the controversy by bringing out how many of the studies surveyed give result X, how many result Y, and possible reasons for the conflicting results obtained. This type of review takes more time but less space, and conveys more information in a form that is easier to grasp.</p>
<p>The review should be up-to-date with appropriate number and type of references. Under-referencing and over-referencing are equally undesirable. Certainly, no effort should be made to inflate the number of references by getting them from the citations in somebody else's publication. Only those references should be cited which you have yourself seen and read, or at least glanced through with a critical eye. The best references to cite are original articles published in journals indexed by PubMed, IndMed or other comparable databases. The worst references are theses, ‘unpublished work’ and ‘personal communication’: these should be used only when the information they provide is both vital and unavailable in more accessible sources.</p>
<p>________________</p>
<p><sup class="footnote" id="ch13fn3">[<a href="#d1e9223">41</a>]</sup></p>
<p><a name="page189"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">189</span></span>The review of literature should culminate in the gaps or lacunae in existing knowledge, or controversies which have yet to be resolved. Next, indicate the deficiencies or discrepancies which your study seeks to address. State your hypothesis, and the aims and objectives of your study. This is a brief but very important part of the thesis, and merits separate headings such as ‘lacunae’, ‘rationale of the study’, ‘hypothesis’, ‘aims and objectives’.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch13lev2sec2"><h2 class="title">Methods</h2>
<p>The thesis should give the methods used in exhausting if not exhaustive detail. When in doubt about a point, it is better to include than to omit it. The section should include the experimental design; a description of the subjects, animals or tissue used, and how these were obtained, housed or stored; inclusion and exclusion criteria; ethical considerations; the techniques used for measurements, and the statistical methods used for analysis of data. The techniques used for measurements should be given in enough detail to demonstrate that the candidate has acquired mastery over them. Further, it should also include the validation of the methods used by indicators of quality control such as intra-assay and inter-assay variation (<a href="/9788184484175/chapter/ch9" class="ulink-exter">Chapter 9</a>).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch13lev2sec3"><h2 class="title">Results</h2>
<p>The results generally include at least the text and tables and sometimes also graphs, diagrams and photographs. The text should be a critical description of salient observations with references to appropriate tables or Figures (<a href="#ch13fig1" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 13.1</a>). Since the thesis, unlike the research paper, does not have limitations of space, the results need be condensed only to the extent necessary for achieving order and easy comprehension. Further, the raw data may also be given as an appendix. Except in the appendices, big Tables should be avoided. If a Table turns out to be too big for an A4 size sheet, all efforts should be made to split it into two or more Tables. Similarly, the Figures should also be easy to grasp. If a single graph has 48 bars, it is better to split it into a few simpler graphs. Unlike in a research paper, some duplication of information is acceptable in a thesis. For example, the text may describe data that exists also in the Tables. Further, the Figures may be used to highlight the most significant results, which might be otherwise lost in a maze of Tables. The legends for Figures should be written carefully.<a name="page190"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">190</span></span></p>
<div class="figure" id="ch13fig1" data-label="Fig. 13.1"><div class="title"><span class="item-label">Fig. 13.1</span> “… Sir, … the hardest part of the thesis is to make the results look like the results you want”</div><img alt="Figure 190-1" src="XML/9788184484175/Chapters/images/190-1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p><span class="italic">(Concept and execution, Dr Ajay Gupta, AIIMS. Slightly modified)</span></p></div><div class="additional-markup"></div></div>
<p><a name="page191"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">191</span></span>It is fairly common to find discrepancies between Figures and Legends, or to find that some of the abbreviations used in Figures have not been explained in the Legends. It is best to write the legend when the figure is drawn. Some improvements in the Figure are often the off-shoot of thoughts which cross the mind while writing the Legend.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch13lev2sec4"><h2 class="title">Discussion</h2>
<p>Discussion is a critique on what was done and what was found. It may start with a brief paragraph on the questions which stimulated the study, and the answers which the study has given. This should be followed by a discussion of the experimental design, including its unique features, why it was chosen, the safeguards built into it and its pitfalls, and the justification for adopting it in spite of the pitfalls. Depending on the nature of the study, a similar critical account may be written up for other aspects of methodology such as choice of the experimental animal, anaesthetic agent, analytic methods and statistical tools used. Any significant innovations or improvisations may also be pointed out.</p>
<p>Next, the principal findings should be restated briefly and interpreted. The observations may be compared with those reported in similar previous studies. If the observations agree, they strengthen the conclusions of the present study. If there are any conflicts with previous studies, explanations should be sought in the way those studies differed from the present one. If there are any reasons for the present results to be more valid, they should be spelt out.</p>
<p>Finally, the concrete contribution made by the study to scientific knowledge should be mentioned briefly. Other points appropriate for the ‘Discussion’ are the potential applications of the study; its limitations, strengths and weaknesses; and areas of ignorance still left; the new questions emerging from the study, and hence suggestions for further research.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch13lev2sec5"><h2 class="title">References</h2>
<p>The collection of references begins well before the study begins. As mentioned earlier, meticulous storage and organization of references helps a lot when the thesis is being written. With computers, no reference really needs to be written twice: once it has been typed, it can be just copied and pasted anywhere, any number of times. This makes it all the more rewarding to type it completely and in the proper format the very first time. In the references, the names of journals are abbreviated, but the abbreviated forms should conform to the PubMed style. For example, the <span class="italic">New England Journal of Medicine</span> should be abbreviated as <span class="italic">N Engl J Med,</span> and not <span class="italic">NEJM.</span><a name="page192"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">192</span></span></p>
<p>A frequent question is raised regarding the best way to cite references: by number, or by name. Further, should the list of references be arranged in the sequence in which the references have been cited, or alphabetically. The most convenient style in the thesis is to cite references by name and year in the text, and list them alphabetically in the bibliography. Although several journals now cite references by number and list them in the sequence in which they are cited at the end of the paper, this style becomes very cumbersome in a thesis which has a few hundred references. Finally, one practical tip: all references cited in the text must be available in the bibliography. If you have a few references extra in the bibliography, which have not been cited in the text, it may not matter, but no reference cited should be missing. What if you have cited a reference, but cannot find it in the bibliography? First, if you have been meticulous throughout, that should not happen. Second, if it has happened, search for the reference, and include it in the bibliography. Finally, if you just cannot find it, and the thesis has to be ready by tomorrow, delete the reference from the text! Do not let your examiner have the pleasure of detecting references which occur in the text but not in the bibliography.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch13lev2sec6"><h2 class="title">Finishing Touches</h2>
<p>Once the review, methods, results, discussion and references are ready, the thesis is almost ready. But still there are some finishing touches to be given, which generally take up much more time than anticipated.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch13lev3sec1"><h3 class="title">Title Page</h3>
<p>The title should be exactly as in the protocol. The title of the thesis will be matched with that of the protocol by some clerks in the university. To them, any deviation from the title in the protocol means that the work actually done is different from that originally proposed, and this is objectionable. If the two titles are identical, they will not bother even if the work reported in the thesis is actually different from that proposed in the protocol! However, if the work done is actually so different that a change of title is absolutely essential, steps for getting the change approved by the university should be initiated a few months before submitting the thesis. As a safeguard against such avoidable hassles, the title originally proposed should be broad enough to be suitable even if the some changes in protocol become necessary after the work has begun. Research requires a flexibility of approach, sometimes to improve upon the original protocol, and sometimes to get around some unforeseen problems. A title broad <a name="page193"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">193</span></span>enough to accommodate these necessities as well as bureaucratic requirements is therefore ideal. However, the title should not be so broad as to look like the title of a monograph. Titles such as “Therapeutic efficacy of yoga” or “The scientific basis of diabetic diets” are not suitable for a thesis.</p>
<p>A few more minor points regarding the title page:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The title page usually has a long sentence which reads somewhat like this: “Thesis submitted to the ____________ University in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of ________”. This is a single sentence. Therefore, it should have no breaks: some students write “Thesis” in large letters on top and then write “Submitted” after a big gap. Secondly, a very common mistake is to write ‘requirement’ instead of ‘requirements’. There are several requirements for the MSc, MD or MS degree: the thesis is one of them. Hence the thesis is a partial fulfillment of the <span class="italic">requirements</span> for the degree.</p></li>
<li><p>At the lower left are the place, month and year of submission. At the lower right is the name of the candidate. Candidates holding the MBBS degree sometimes prefix their name with the title ‘Dr.’. This is impolite. Even authors of books holding doctoral degrees do not use titles like ‘Dr.’ or ‘Prof.’ on the cover of the book.</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch13lev3sec2"><h3 class="title">Certificate</h3>
<p>It is best to stick closely to the format used in a recently approved thesis. However, make sure to correct grammatical or spelling errors, if any.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch13lev3sec3"><h3 class="title">Dedication</h3>
<p>This is totally optional. Since there are many slips between the cup and the lip, do not dedicate the thesis to your boy friend or girl friend, no matter how much inspiration you got from him/her. If you are already married, you can secure everlasting domestic bliss by dedicating the thesis to your mother-in-law.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch13lev3sec4"><h3 class="title">Acknowledgements</h3>
<p>This is the most-read part of the thesis. Make sure that you thank, by name, all those who helped you, and also all those who matter, even if they did not help you. Some students have a tendency to thank the guide in superlative terms using language which has no relationship to reality. The acknowledgement is not meant to be a worshipful obeisance to a hypothetical ideal guru. It is an expression of gratitude <a name="page194"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">194</span></span>to a real person who has a few strengths as well as weaknesses. The acknowledgement should consist of just a few sentences on how the strengths of the guide helped you in the thesis work. If you think for a few minutes about the real person whom you wish to thank in a few sentences, you will come up with words which will do justice to him and be based on reality at the same time.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch13lev3sec5"><h3 class="title">List of Abbreviations</h3>
<p>Providing a list of abbreviations, and what they stand for, is good, but that does not absolve you of two basic responsibilities. First, avoid using unusual abbreviations or coining new abbreviations in the thesis. Secondly, the first time you use an expression which you want to abbreviate, give the full form followed by the abbreviation in brackets.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch13lev3sec6"><h3 class="title">Lists of Tables and Figures</h3>
<p>Since computers have made it easy to place Tables and Figures exactly where they should be, these lists have become redundant and may be omitted.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch13lev3sec7"><h3 class="title">Table of Contents</h3>
<p>The table should list everything, including a few things which have been placed before the table of contents itself. Pagination of the thesis may begin with the Introduction or Review of Literature. The pages before that may be numbered i, ii, iii, …. and so on.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch13lev3sec8"><h3 class="title">Abstract</h3>
<p>The abstract should give in about 200 words on a single page the why, what and how of the project as well as what was found and what it all means. It enriches the abstract if you fit into it some quantitative data. At the foot of the page may be given a few key words.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch13lev3sec9"><h3 class="title">Introduction</h3>
<p>The introduction should place the work in a broader context, and also give a glimpse of what was done, what was found, and what difference the study would make to scientific knowledge or patient care. Ideally, the introduction should also be just one page, and should read more like a piece of literature than scientific writing.<a name="page195"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">195</span></span></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch13lev3sec10"><h3 class="title">Summary and Conclusions</h3>
<p>Summary and conclusions are placed towards the end of the thesis, either immediately before or after the bibliography. This section is more elaborate than the abstract. The matter may be placed under headings such as Background, Hypothesis, Objectives, Methods, Outcome Measures, Results and Conclusions. The points made under each heading may be enumerated for clarity.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch13lev3sec11"><h3 class="title">Appendices</h3>
<p>The appendices may include raw data, proformas or questionnaires used in the study, and publications emanating from the work done for the thesis. In addition to the list of such publications, photocopies of their reprints may also be included in the appendices.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div><div class="section" id="ch13lev1sec4"><h1 class="title">PACKAGING THE PRODUCT</h1>
<p>You might need at least 5 copies of the thesis. Most pages, except photographs and colour diagrams, may be photocopied from the original printout. The next task is to put all the material together and make the required number of sets. You might like to demarcate the major sections by means of coloured sheets of paper. On these sheets you may have the name of the section that follows, and possibly a suitable quotation. But these are all optional frills. What is more important is to leaf through each set carefully to make sure that each set has each page, at the right place and rightly oriented. This is particularly important if you are going in for hard-binding and not spiral binding. Depending upon the requirements of the university and your guide's preference, you might be expected to also write your thesis on a few CDs and upload your thesis on the university's website as a PDF file.</p>
</div><div class="section" id="ch13lev1sec5"><h1 class="title">DEFENCE OF THESIS</h1>
<p>In case of PhD students, submitting the thesis is not the end of the ordeal. They have to make an oral presentation of their work, at least to their doctoral committee, and in most cases the audience also includes other interested members of the department or institution: in fact, anybody is welcome to the presentation. That is why the presentation is also called ‘public defence’. The audience is also free to ask the candidate any questions related to the research. The examiners have generally seen the thesis in advance of the presentation, and come prepared with questions. There are also some questions sent by the ‘foreign examiner’ (i.e. from another country) which are <a name="page196"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">196</span></span>put on his behalf by one of the examiners present at the oral examination.</p>
<p>For the student, the oral examination is a very special event. It marks the culmination of about 5 years of hard work. He feels like talking about the work at length. He cannot understand how a brief 20-30 minute presentation can do justice to so much of work. But the student should also look at the issue from the point of view of the audience. Most of the audience is not interested in details: they would not understand them anyway. The examiners have already read the thesis, and therefore know what the student is going to say. To them, the really important part of the oral examination is the way the candidate answers the questions. Therefore, the oral presentation tests the students’ skill at presenting the work in a comprehensible manner in 20-30 minutes. The presentation should be illustrated by slides. It should make sense to those who do not know much about the subject, and yet not appear trivial, popular, or ‘too simple for a PhD’.</p>
<p>The most effective and convenient way to illustrate the presentation is through PowerPoint slides. However, simply using PowerPoint does not guarantee a good presentation. I have seen some very senior people waste the facility by choosing fonts and colours which make the slides difficult to read. Just because the slides look satisfactory on the computer monitor does not mean that they will necessarily be good for projection. In projection, the colours often get modified, and the long distance between the screen and the audience might make the font size too small to be read in spite of the magnification by the projector.

<p>The questions asked by the examiners after the oral presentation generally fall in four categories. <span class="italic">First,</span> there are the questions about the work done: clarification of some points, why something was done one way and not the other, why one more questions was not asked from the study when it would have taken so little extra effort, etc. <span class="italic">Second,</span> there are questions regarding inconsistencies and discrepancies in the thesis – not necessarily serious ones – for which the candidate better apologise. <span class="italic">Third,</span> there are questions not based on the student's research itself, but belonging to his broad area of research. Answers to these questions tell the examiner how well the student has mastered the general area of his work, and whether the student has kept himself abreast with the latest developments in his subject. These are questions which cannot be answered satisfactorily through a few days’ study just before the examination. They require steady reading and reflection <a name="page197"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">197</span></span>over the 5 years of PhD. <span class="italic">Finally,</span> there are some general questions such as the candidate's future plans, whether he wants to continue working in the same area, and some general, even philosophical, questions about science, education and research.</p>
<p>It is extremely rare for a PhD student to reach the stage of the oral examination and not get the degree. But that is not the point. I have not seen even one case where a student went through an oral but did not get the PhD, but I have seen several cases where the student was left with the feeling that he got the degree without deserving it. Therefore, the oral examination should not be taken lightly. Throughout the 5 years of PhD the student should remember that he is working for the highest degree awarded by a university, that he is working for a degree which is the hallmark of profound scholarship. He can write a satisfactory thesis even by working like a glorified technician, but he cannot make a mark in the viva unless he is a sincere and studious scholar.</p>

<p>The final days just before submission of the thesis are always a stressful period. No matter how good your intentions and how hard you work, your thesis will never be ready two weeks ahead of the deadline. Murphy's law has infinite expressions, and has a special love for students writing their thesis.<sup><a href="#ch13fn4" class="ulink-inter">4</a></sup> So, if you are having sleepless nights near your deadline, you can take some comfort in knowing that it happens to everybody. So, work hard but do not panic: however, it might pay to appear panicky – it might stimulate your guide, the typist, the statistician, and your friends who are helping you with proof reading to take pity on you and do their bit more promptly.</p>
<p>A question is often raised whether writing a thesis is really necessary. A more fundamental question is whether research is really necessary. There is no question that research should be a necessary part of postgraduate education. Postgraduate education implies in-depth learning. Since MSc and MD courses have to emphasize breadth because the student should be able to teach any topic and treat any patient in his speciality, the only opportunity for in-depth learning is through the research required as a qualifying requirement for the degree.</p>

<p><a name="page198"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">198</span></span>At a more down-to-earth level, since an MD or MS degree entitles a person to climb the ladder right up to the Professor's level and qualifies him to be a guide or examiner for even a PhD student, it is essential that the person should have done at least some research for getting the MD or MS degree. If research is necessary, the thesis is also necessary because it is unrealistic that the person will necessarily be able to publish his research in a journal before taking the MD/MS examination. Further, the thesis is also good training in writing skills, organization, and time management. Thesis is just about the only place where a person can describe his research in detail without any constraints of space. For that reason, it also serves as a good record of techniques for those who take up similar work in future and wish to use the same techniques. So much in favour of the thesis, but does the thesis do any harm? According to Prof. NK Bhide, thesis writing destroys for life the student's ability to express himself briefly. However, the baby need not be thrown with the bath water. The sensible response to this valid criticism would be to use the unlimited length permissible in a thesis for giving useful information, not for avoidable verbosity. Some Scandinavian universities, however, have an alternative to the conventional thesis for PhD students. The students there are expected to publish their work side by side as they work. At the completion of the project, the student puts together photocopies of the published papers and the manuscripts submitted for publication between two covers, and that is considered the thesis. This alternative to the thesis is possible for PhD because the course lasts about 5 years, but it would be unthinkable for an MSc or MD project. In any case, no matter what course the student is pursuing, it is desirable to publish the work in journals as soon as possible. In case of PhD students, it should be always possible to have at least one published paper by the time they submit the thesis. Even MD or MSc students should, as a rule, work on a paper within 6 months of submitting the thesis. Further delay generally means that the paper never gets written up. Published papers help in getting jobs and awards. Further, publishing the research is a moral obligation. Work confined to a thesis is not public knowledge: for that a paper in an indexed journal is essential. It is a moral duty to share with the world the work which has been supported by public funds. And, there is hardly any research work to which the taxpayer does not contribute through at least a few salaries or fellowships. Some guidelines on how to write a research paper have been discussed in the next chapter.<a name="page199"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">199</span></span></p>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>What is the best way to do proof reading?</p></li>
<li><p>In the ‘Results’, what is preferable: Tables or Figures?</p></li>
<li><p>Should the section of citations in the thesis be called ‘References’ or ‘Bibliography’?</p></li>
</ol>
<p><bold>ANSWERS AND SOLUTIONS</bold></p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Computers have reduced the drudgery of proof reading considerably, but it continues to be necessary. As a first step, look at the computer screen: words which the computer ‘thinks’ have been spelt wrongly are underlined with a red wavy line. Correct such words, if you agree with the computer. Next, if the typing has been done from a hand-written draft, two persons should sit down for proof reading – one (preferably the author) with the draft, and the other with the typescript. The one with the draft should read it out aloud, while the other person should look at the typescript with the intention of detecting any discrepancies. This is a very important step because sometimes a whole clause or sentence or even a page might be missing in the typescript, and even the author may not detect the discontinuity if he reads the proof all by himself. Next, the author should read the proof alone to detect mistakes and grammatical errors, and to make any improvements in the text.</p>
<p>After that every subsequent revision can be proof-read by the author single-handed to make sure that changes conform to what he wanted.</p></li>
<li><p>As a rule, Tables are preferable because they give numerical data. However, the Tables cannot be grasped as quickly as Figures. Therefore, the most important observations may be given also as figures. Further, in an oral presentation of the work, slides should carry Figures rather than Tables because there quick grasp is of vital importance (<a href="/9788184484175/chapter/ch15" class="ulink-exter">Chapter 15</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>It should preferably be called ‘References’. The reason is that bibliography is a non-specific term for a list of reading material. Thus bibliography may be simply ‘suggested reading’ or a list of all the publications of a scientist. On the other hand, the references at the end of a thesis are strictly those which have been cited, or referred to, in the text. Since it is a list of reading material which has been referred to, it is better to give it a more specific label such as ‘References’ or ‘Literature Cited’.</p></li>
