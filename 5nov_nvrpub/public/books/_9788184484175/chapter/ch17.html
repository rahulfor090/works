From that springs for each one of us a compulsion to do to every animal all the good we possibly can. By helping an insect when it is in difficulties, I am only attempting to cancel part of man's ever new debt to the animal world.</span></p><p><span class="italic">—ALBERT SCHWEITZER</span></p><p>Human experiments are considered most ethical when the experiment is likely to benefit the subjects. When benefit to the subjects is unlikely, the experiment is still considered ethical if the subjects have given their informed consent. In case of animal experiments, no animal benefits by being experimented upon. Further, if animals could give their informed consent, it is quite sure that they would not (<a href="#ch17fig1" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 17.1</a>). Moreover, medical experiments are done on animals instead of humans invariably because the suffering and sacrifice involved would be unacceptable in human studies. Therefore, strictly speaking, no animal experiment is ethical. However, some animal experiments may be justified in terms of, what Albert Schweitzer calls, relative ethics. If the degree of pain or suffering for the animals is acceptably low, and the benefit expected for mankind significantly high, the experiment may be valid in terms of relative ethics.</p><p>Besides research, animals have several other uses in medicine and related areas.<a name="page246"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">246</span></span></p><div class="figure" id="ch17fig1" data-label="Fig. 17.1"><div class="title"><span class="item-label">Fig. 17.1</span> What do you mean?

Postgraduates in basic science departments perform animal experiments not only for research and a better grasp of theoretical concepts but also for retention of skills. These skills are necessary for teachers in these departments, and hands-on experience is the only way to pass them on from generation to generation. Animals play a major role in new drug development. Clinical trials for testing the efficacy and safety of drugs in animals are mandatory before the drugs are released for trials on human beings. Finally, a large number of animals are used for testing the safety of cosmetics, and this is a highly controversial use.</p><p>Since animal experiments can be defended only in terms of relative ethics, there has always been a conflict between scientists doing these experiments and those opposed to such experiments on moral grounds. Because of the spectacular achievements of modern medicine, specially during the period 1850-1950, and the immense contribution of animal experiments to these achievements, even those opposed to animal experiments generally do not ask for a total ban. On the other hand, even scientists acknowledge the basic immorality of animal experiments, and therefore support only minimal use of animals, and that too only for experiments which do not involve undue pain and suffering. The general agreement on restricting animal use in medical research and education has been expressed in terms of three Rs: Replacement of animal experiments by alternatives, Reduction in the number of animals used, and Refinement of the experiments to minimize suffering. However, the agreement ends there because the suitability of the alternatives, the minimum number of animals (sample size) necessary for an experiment, and the degree of discomfort that is acceptable, are all subject to biased interpretation.</p><div class="section" id="ch17lev1sec1"><h1 class="title">THE CASE AGAINST ANIMAL EXPERIMENTS</h1>
<p>The only invincible argument against animal experiments is the moral argument. But since the stated position of those opposed to animal experiments is that a certain amount of painless experimentation may continue if it leads to human welfare, their arguments are designed to ‘prove’ that animal experiments are unnecessary for human welfare. For example, they argue that animal experiments give misleading results because of species differences, because of the stressful conditions under which animals are housed and experimented upon, <a name="page248"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">248</span></span>and because animal models of disease mimic human disease rather poorly. Recent advances have prompted the arguments that cell and tissue culture techniques, and computer simulation, can serve as substitutes for animal experiments. These arguments are then generalised to conclude that all research on animals is not only unnecessary, but could even lead to erroneous results which may harm mankind. The conclusion is strengthened by citing a few supporting examples while the benefits that have accrued from animal experiments are ignored.</p>
<p>After dismissing animal research for generation of new knowledge as useless or even harmful, it is easy to oppose experiments which merely confirm the results of previous studies, and experiments for teaching or retention of skills. Finally, the use of animals for testing the safety of cosmetics is an obvious exploitation of animals to satisfy human vanity.</p>
<p>Those who actively take up the cause of preventing cruelty to animals as a mission are emotionally charged, and therefore often resort to powerful propaganda, and also to aggressive methods such as raiding laboratories where animal experiments are done, and threatening those who supply animals. The result has been that whenever the wave against animal experimentation has picked up momentum, it has practically taken the shape of a movement for a total ban on all such experiments.</p>
</div><div class="section" id="ch17lev1sec2"><h1 class="title">THE CASE FOR ANIMAL EXPERIMENTS</h1>
<p>A dispassionate look at the history of medicine reveals that animal experiments have made enormous contributions to human welfare, and that these experiments could not have been performed on human beings. The etiology of infectious diseases, and the development of vaccines and antibiotics, were all made possible through indispensable work with animals. Insulin was discovered through animal experiments, and for several decades the only insulins available for treatment of diabetes were porcine and bovine insulins. George Bernard Shaw, a staunch vegetarian and a vociferous critic of animal experiments, got pernicious anemia towards the end of his life. The only treatment then known for pernicious anemia was liver therapy. At the risk of damaging his public image, he finally accepted liver therapy and survived an additional ten years.<a name="page249"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">249</span></span></p>
<div class="figure" id="ch17fig2" data-label="Fig. 17.2"><div class="title"><span class="item-label">Fig. 17.2</span> Developing new drugs is critically dependent on animal experiments. (Reproduced, with permission, from <span class="italic">HouseCalls,</span> May-June 2004, Ponnappa's Page, p. 23.

<p>Animals have also made the development of testing of new drugs possible at little risk to human beings (<a href="#ch17fig2" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 17.2</a>). In the recent past, the development of cardiac surgery, dialysis and renal transplantation have depended heavily on animal experimentation. Quite clearly, the misleading results from animal experiments due to species differences have been an exception rather than the rule. These differences are grossly exaggerated by those opposed to animal experiments.</p>
<p>While animal experiments might have contributed immensely in the past, are they still necessary? This doubt is based on two facts. It is true that much of useful information for prevention and management of currently prevalent lifestyle and stress-related disorders has come from human rather than animal studies. Secondly, there are several in <span class="italic">vitro</span> and computer models now available which make minimal use of animals. A committee of the National Research Council of USA deliberated on this issue for three years. Their conclusion was that “laboratory animals are likely to remain a critical part of human health-care research for the foreseeable future. Researchers have developed a number of experimental techniques <a name="page250"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">250</span></span>that help reduce the need for animals; such efforts should continue to be encouraged. However, there is little chance these alternatives will eliminate the need for research animals anytime soon. Available models simply cannot re-create the complexity of real living systems” (Hackerman 1991). Although this report is nearly 20 years old, most medical scientists would consider its conclusions valid even today.</p>
<p>While the above discussion is reasonable, and provides a pragmatic, if not moral, justification for animal experiments, scientists have sometimes come up with absurd arguments to defend animal experiments. One such argument is the contention that animals do not feel pain, in spite of the fact that animals have been used extensively in research on physiology of pain. It took a committee of 18 learned persons three years to conclude <span class="italic">tentatively</span> on the basis of behavioral, neuroanatomical and neurochemical criteria that all vertebrates feel pain, and that among invertebrates, octopuses feel pain but insects and earthworms do not (Bateson 1992).</p>
</div><div class="section" id="ch17lev1sec3"><h1 class="title">THE OFFICIAL RESPONSE</h1>
<p>The official response to the ethical questions related to animal experiments typically has been legislation, and appointment of committees to enforce the laws. The legislation is based on a compromise between extreme positions. It essentially requires that:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The animals should be housed comfortably.</p></li>
<li><p>The number of animal experiments should be restricted to the minimum necessary.</p></li>
<li><p>The number of animals used in each experiment should be reduced to the minimum necessary.</p></li>
<li><p>The use of animals should be necessary for achieving the goal of the research project.</p></li>
<li><p>The goal of the research project should be worth achieving.</p></li>
<li><p>The degree of suffering involved in the experiment should be minimized.</p>
<p>Certain types of suffering are unacceptable: for example, a painful procedure should not be performed without anesthesia, or under inadequate anesthesia. It is criminal to perform a procedure under inadequate anesthesia and to use a neuromuscular blocking agent like curare to immobilize the animal. Although a curarized animal cannot move, curare does not affect its capacity to feel pain.<a name="page251"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">251</span></span></p></li>
<li><p>In the ultimate analysis, the decision to allow an experiment depends on cost-benefit considerations.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>If the cost in terms of animal suffering is low in relation to the expected benefit, the experiment may be approved. If the suffering is unacceptably high, the experiment should not be approved, no matter how great the benefit expected is. The benefits of the experiments need not necessarily be in terms of expected advances which would improve health-care. Other acceptable benefits are the advances in scientific knowledge and understanding without immediate applied value, and contributions to education and training, employment and economy, and conservation of natural resources (Bateson 1992).</p>
<p>It is obvious that each of the above points leaves enough room for subjective interpretation. It is impossible to measure how much the animals would suffer in an experiment, and how important is the expected benefit. Since legislation to regulate animal experiments has invariably been drafted and enacted under pressure from activists concerned with cruelty to animals, the activists play an important role in ensuring at least a minimal ethical standard in research on animals. However, the vigor and enthusiasm of activists fluctuates. The laws remaining constant, when the activists are not active, almost any experiment is possible so long as the suffering involved is not unacceptably high. The judgement regarding whether the experiment is at all necessary is left entirely to the investigator, which is quite meaningless. Every investigator thinks, or at least claims, that his experiment is extremely important. On the other hand, when activists are wide awake, they invariably manage to find their way into ethics committees. Then the ethics committees turn into a policing agency, the unstated but clearly visible goal of which is to stop all animal experimentation. Every experiment under consideration becomes inappropriate, unnecessary or unimportant. People who do not understand the scientific implications of the experiment take it upon themselves to prove lack of scientific merit in experiments. Letting only the investigator judge the merit of the experiments is one extreme, letting the activists do it is another, and neither serves the cause of scientific research. Judging the scientific merit of the experiments under consideration should be left to the scientists in the ethics committees, and people with strong opinions should ideally be kept out of the committees.<a name="page252"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">252</span></span></p>
<div class="section" id="ch17lev2sec1"><h2 class="title">The Indian Scene</h2>
<p>In India, there has existed since 1960 the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act. The Act was amended in 1982. The favourite of scientists in this Act is Section 14 which states “Nothing contained in this Act will render unlawful the performance of experiments (including experiments involving operations) on animals for the purpose of advancement by new discovery of physiological knowledge or of knowledge which will be useful for saving or for prolonging life or alleviating suffering or for combating any disease, whether of human beings, animals or plants”. However, the Act also has provision for appointment of a Committee for the Purpose of Control and Supervision of Experiments on Animals (CPCSEA). Such a Committee was constituted in 1997, and it circulated a set of Draft Rules in September 1998. Some of the rules in the draft created a furore among medical scientists engaged in animal experiments. The major offending rules required that:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>every proposal for animal experiments be cleared by CPCSEA,</p></li>
<li><p>every animal be issued for an experiment after getting approval from CPCSEA, and</p></li>
<li><p>anesthesia be administered to an experimental animal only by a veterinary surgeon.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>It is clearly unrealistic for a single high-level national committee with very busy people as its members to screen the projects from the whole country, <span class="italic">and</span> to sanction the issue of <span class="italic">each</span> animal. Further, some institutions may have just one veterinary surgeon to supervise the animal facility. It is impossible for this one person to anesthetize every animal experimented upon in every department of the institution. Some other unpalatable rules in the draft were that:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>no experiments were permissible for ‘illustration’ or for attaining/retaining skills, which meant essentially no experiments for teaching,</p></li>
<li><p>no experiments were permissible for confirming previous research, which is also unrealistic: in science reproducibility of results in an important criterion for validity,</p></li>
<li><p>the housing conditions prescribed for animals were unrealistic under Indian conditions,</p></li>
<li><p>the paperwork required was very tedious and time-consuming,</p></li>
<li><p>animals could be acquired only from registered vendors: for some animals, registered vendors did not exist; in some cases, the vendors decided to go in for some other business because they found the rules too difficult to comply with, and<a name="page253"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">253</span></span></p>
<div class="sidebar">
<h2 class="title">MAN IS A RATIONAL ANIMAL!</h2>
<p><ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p>Those opposed to animal experiments generally do not refuse drugs developed and tested through animal experiments.</p></li>
<li><p>Experiments on rats, frogs and fish are considered more acceptable than those on dogs and cats.</p></li>
<li><p>Those opposed to animal experiments are relatively lenient towards the use of animals as food.</p></li>
<li><p>Animal activists are more willing to condone sports such as fishing and the use of animals for transportation, labour or religious rituals than scientific experiments on animals.</p></li>
<li><p>Several vegetarians perform animal experiments.</p></li>
<li><p>Several people love their pets but perform animal experiments.</p></li>
<li><p>Hitler was cruel to the Jews but passed laws against cruelty to animals in Germany in 1930.</p></li>
<li><p>Rickshaws in which a human being is pulled manually by another human being were legal in Kolkata till 2006.</p></li>
<li><p>The housing conditions and hygienic standards of food and water legally prescribed for laboratory animals are better than those available to plenty of human beings.</p></li>
</ul></p>
</div></li>
<li><p>animals could not be transferred from one institution to another: this is often required, particularly in case of special in-bred strains required for certain experiments – in some cases, a pair of such animals might even have to be imported from an institution in another country.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In spite of the protests by scientists, the draft rules were finalised with little modification, and became law through a Gazette Notification in December 1998. However, the protests continued, and the result was that some of the provisions were amended in February 2001 and once again in January 2006. As compared to the 1998 rules, some of the significant differences in the current rules are that:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
<li><p>Institutional Animals Ethics Committee (IAEC) can screen projects and sanction the issue of animals,</p></li>
<li><p>a wide range of qualified persons are entitled to anesthetize animals: it is not mandatory for the veterinary surgeon to do so,</p></li>
<li><p>experiments for teaching purposes are permissible with a few qualifications and reservations,</p></li>
<li><p>repetition of experiments is permissible with proper justification, and</p></li>
<li><p>in case a registered breeder is not available, animals may be procured from an alternate legal source.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The overall result of the recent legislation and public debate has been that over a period of 10 years, animal experimentation in the country has come down drastically. While some experiments on rats, <a name="page254"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">254</span></span>mice, frogs and rabbits continue, experiments on dogs, cats and monkeys have virtually stopped. The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) published in 2006 a compilation of the guidelines and rules on animal experimentation in India and several other countries.</p>
</div>
</div><div class="section" id="ch17lev1sec4"><h1 class="title">CLOSING THOUGHTS</h1>
<p>It is because of the spectacular advances that modern medicine made during the period 1850-1950, and the immense contribution that animal experiments made to these advances, that even the most vociferous anti-vivisectionists have seldom asked for a total ban on animal experiments. However, the question arises whether animal experiments will be able to make the same contribution to the control of diseases which medicine is most concerned about now, viz. cardiovascular diseases, complications of diabetes, and cancer. These diseases are not just different from those which were conquered through animal experiments: they are a different kind of diseases. These diseases result from slow accumulation of damage over decades. The damage results from a faulty lifestyle and chronic mental stress. Faulty lifestyle and chronic mental stress are uniquely human problems. Animals neither have these problems naturally, nor is it easy to develop animal models for these problems. Our understanding of these diseases has, therefore, benefited more from epidemiological and clinical studies than animal studies. Another justification advanced for the need to reduce animal experiments is the availability of several alternatives. However, none of these alternatives can completely replace studies on whole animals.</p>
<p>It is interesting that rules and guidelines regarding the use of laboratory animals focus on the housing conditions of animals and the degree of pain or suffering involved in the experiments. Besides this, loss of freedom may itself be a major source of stress.</p>
<p>A prisoner housed in a very comfortable cell with no possibility of being exposed to any painful experiment can still suffer enormously. Therefore, the duration of captivity should also be probably an important consideration in the humane treatment of animals.</p>

<h2 class="title">ALTERNATIVES TO ANIMAL EXPERIMENTS</h2>

</div>
<p><a name="page255"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">255</span></span>It is sometimes argued that life thrives on life: that is a basic principle in the animal world. Even vegetarians eat plants, and plants also have life. This is an absurd argument. While plants also deserve our love and affection, and may have feelings, the level of consciousness in plants is so different from that in higher animals that consuming plants for food cannot be equated with killing animals – whether for food, or for any other purpose. It is also pointed out that several animals eat only other animals. Each living being has to live according to its nature (<span class="italic">swadharma,</span> or own dharma – dharma here meaning right conduct). What is right for the tiger is not right for human beings. Once Sri Ramakrishna saved a scorpion from drowning. The scorpion bit him and fell back in water. Sri Ramakrishna again picked up the scorpion to save it. The scorpion struggled while being picked up, bit Sri Ramakrishna, and again fell back in water. This went on for some time. Someone asked Sri Ramakrishna why he was so persistent in his efforts to save the scorpion in spite of being bitten several times. He replied that the scorpion was acting true to its nature, and so was he. It was the scorpion's nature to bite; it was his nature to save a drowning creature.</p>
<p>Ethical principles are not the ultimate guide for right actions. They are somewhere between law and spiritual action. Law lays down the minimum expectations. Ethics go one step further: they are desirable guidelines, but every violation may not necessarily invite penal action. Acting on conscience goes still further: the individual acts on his own sense of right and wrong, feeling responsible to himself rather than to anyone overseeing him. However, conscience may also be affected by the cultural background and environment of the individual. Spiritual action is close to acting on conscience, but goes one step further in being motivated by an inner voice which originates in the person's divine essence – a voice which is completely independent of all mental considerations.</p>
