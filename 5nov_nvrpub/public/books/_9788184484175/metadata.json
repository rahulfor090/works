Written in an easy-to-understand format, the book demystifies the core principles of research methodology, study design, data analysis, ethics, and publication practices. Covering a wide spectrum—from formulating a research question to interpreting statistics and publishing in peer-reviewed journals—the book bridges the gap between theory and practice. Real-world examples, simplified explanations, and practical tips make it a valuable resource for those venturing into research for the first time or aiming to strengthen their foundation. Whether you are preparing for a thesis, evaluating scientific literature, or embarking on an independent study, this book equips you with the essential tools to understand, conduct, and critique medical research with confidence.
