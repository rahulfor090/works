<h2 class="title"><a name="page7"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">7</span></span>Preface to the Eighth Edition</h2>
<p class="noindent">Standing at the crossroads of a rapidly changing environment and a world where technology revolutionizes each aspect of our life, our eyes continue to witness big and small events every day that accumulate and change the course of human history. When the seventh edition of <span class="italic">Essentials of Ophthalmology</span> was published in 2019, we did not know that we were at the brink of a life-alerting pandemic that would go on for years. Or that our systems of healthcare and research would continue to be in flux for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p class="indent">In the case of ophthalmology too, there has been a considerable evolution in the way that diseases are now diagnosed and managed, new surgical techniques have been adopted, and changes have been made to hospital policies and medical management systems. In bringing out this new edition, I have reviewed and reflected on all such changes that have taken place since 2019. In this eighth edition, readers will find: updated chapters on new investigation processes, surgical procedures, disease control and management. The chapter on community ophthalmology, ‘Blindness and Prevention of Blindness’ has been thoroughly changed as per National Programme for Control of Blindness and Visual Impairment (NPCB &amp; VI), Government of India. Keeping in mind the ease of revision for students, the bulleted format of the book, detailed illustrations, a selection of slit-lamp examination, have of course been retained. Wherever applicable, all four-colour images have been updated.</p>
<p class="indent">My thanks to the team of M/s Jaypee Brothers Medical Publishers (P) Ltd, New Delhi, India, for their continued support. I am forever grateful to the community of doctors and staff members of Disha Eye Hospitals, Kolkata, West Bengal, India. A special thanks to my wife Dr Bani, my son Dr Soham Basak and my daughter Sohini.</p>
<p class="indent">As an author, it is encouraging to hear from so many of my readers, who are undergraduates, postgraduates, and practising optometrists and ophthalmologists. Thank you for all your suggestions, comments, and active engagement with the book. All of your responses have gone into the making of this new edition. Once again, I welcome and look forward to your criticisms, questions, and suggestions.</p>
<p class="indent">My hope is that this edition, like its predecessors, will encourage readers, students, and new practitioners of medicine to think critically about ophthalmology and ophthalmological practises.</p>

<h2 class="title"><a name="page8"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">8</span></span>Preface to the First Edition</h2>
<p class="noindent">Most medical colleges do not have a required undergraduate teaching course in ophthalmology. Consequently, the students are often sadly deficient in this subject, unless they are specially interested. In addition, an acute shortage of time, prevents the students from reading large textbooks on this subject. Many students complain that most of the available books are either too brief or too extensive. It is with the hope of bridging this gap that I have written this book.</p>
<p class="indent">This book focusses on the information in a concise, step-wise, outline format which is essential for getting a true picture of the subject. The arrangement of the subject matter is to-the-point, and up-to-date with plenty of line diagrams which are easily reproducible during examination. Though this book is essentially meant for the undergraduate students, I hope, it will be very useful to the postgraduate students as well as practising ophthalmologists, for a quick revision of the subject.</p>
<p class="indent">In conclusion, I shall be happy if this book proves itself to be a valuable guide both for the undergraduate and postgraduate students, especially during their examination. Any critical comment and suggestion from the students and teachers, regarding this effort, will be appreciated.</p>
