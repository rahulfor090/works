<p class="noindent">It is the most practical method of estimating the condition of refraction objectively, <span class="italic">with accommodation at rest</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Optics:</span> It entails a study of the movements of the retinal image produced by a beam of light that sweeps across the pupil.</p>
<p class="indent">The observer then watches this illuminated retinal image by looking down the path of incident light, through a hole in the center of a mirror (retinoscope) <bold>(<a href="#ch9fig1" class="ulink-inter">Figs. 9.1A and B</a>)</bold>.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">If the eye is emmetropic:</span> Parallel rays of light come to a point focus on retina, so they are emerging in the same pathway.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">If the eye is hypermetropic:</span> Parallel rays converge behind the retina and hence, the emerging rays are divergent.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">The principle of retinoscopy is to make every observing eye emmetropic, so that the emerging rays should form a parallel beam.</p>

<div class="section" id="ch9lev3sec1"><h3 class="title">Cycloplegia</h3>
<p class="noindent">It is required in children and young patients. In adults and old patients, it is usually not necessary.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">If the patient is less than 5 years:</span> Atropine eye ointment (1%) is to be applied three times daily for 3 days.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">If the patient is between 5 and 15 years:</span> 1% cyclopentolate, or 2% homatropine eye drop is instilled for 3 times, about 1 hour before examination.</p></li>

<p class="indent">The refraction under cycloplegia is always pathological because the shape of the lens has been altered.

<div class="section" id="ch9lev3sec2"><h3 class="title">Dark-room Test</h3>
<p class="noindent">Retinoscopy should preferably be conducted in a darkroom.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Examiner sits at 1 meter away from the patient (point of reversal will then be 1.5D). It is even more convenient to sit at arm's length, i.e., two-thirds meter away, so that the trial lenses can be held in the other hand while the light beam is passed. The point of reversal is then 1.5D.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The patient is normally seated and looking toward the far end of the room (relaxed eye).</p></li>
<li><p class="">Source of light is from behind the patient.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The surgeon looks through a <span class="italic">plane mirror</span> with central perforation, and light is reflected into the patient's eye.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The mirror is slowly moved from side to side in different meridians, and movement of the shadow is noted.</p></li>
<li><p class="">In hypermetropia, emmetropia and myopia of less than 1.0D the reflex moves in the same direction, in myopia of 1.0D there is no shadow, in myopia of greater than 1D the shadow moves in the opposite direction.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Increasing convex (if the movement is on the same side) or concave (if on the opposite side) lenses are placed before the eye until the <span class="italic">point of reversal</span> is reached. <span class="italic">At this point, there will be no movement of the shadow, and pupil will be brightly illuminated.</span></p></li>
<li><p class="">The procedure is done for each meridians separately.
<ul style="list-style-type: square">
<li><p class="">In simple spherical refractive error—the movement and the point of reversal will be same in both meridians.</p></li>

<div class="section" id="ch9lev3sec3"><h3 class="title">Calculation</h3>
<p class="noindent">Refraction of patient's eye = lens required to reach end point = −1D (myopia).</p>
<p class="noindent">Since the surgeon is sitting at 1 meter distance, and if he is at two-thirds meter, it will be −1.5D (myopic).</p>
<p class="noindent">So the refraction of the eye = −1.0D + lens.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Examples</span></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">If the end-point is with + 4.0 D lens:</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Refraction</span> <span class="italic">=</span> −1.0D + 4.0D = +3.0D.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Similarly with −4.0D lens:</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Refraction</span> <span class="italic">=</span> −1.0D – 4.0D = −5.0D</p>

</ul>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Refraction</span> <span class="italic">=</span> −1.0D + 1.0D = 0, i.e., the patient is emmetropic.</p>

<p class="noindent">It is a method to determine the degree of ametropia by special instrument called <span class="italic">refractometer</span>.</p>
<p class="indent">In it, a clear retinal image of a test object is formed by an optical system, and the degree of adjustment required, gives a measurement of the ametropia.</p>
<p class="indent">Recently, electronic refractometry (auto- refractometer) <bold>(<a href="#ch9fig3" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 9.3</a>)</bold> is popularly used in clinical practice.

<p class="subchapter">SUBJECTIVE METHODS</p>
</div><div class="section" id="ch9lev1sec4"><h1 class="title">SUBJECTIVE VERIFICATION OF REFRACTION</h1>

<div class="section" id="ch9lev2sec2"><h2 class="title">Procedures</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Each eye is to be tested separately, the other eye being blocked, and then finally tested together.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Appropriate lenses as found by objective test are inserted in the trial frame.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Slight modification of the inserted lens gives a maximum visual acuity.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Verification may be needed with a <span class="italic">cross cylinder</span>, or <span class="italic">astigmatic fan</span> in case of astigmatism.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Sometimes, <span class="italic">fogging method</span> is necessary to induce a relaxation of accommodation especially in hypermetropia.</p>
<p class="">As a rule, the patient is given the strongest hypermetropic, or weakest myopic correction with normal visual acuity.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The addition of the correction for near work (if necessary), and testing of the acuity with near-types, uniocularly and then binocularly.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Then the spectacles are ordered with necessary comments (e.g., for constant wear, or near works only, etc.).</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="">Here, the eyes are made artificially myopic by addition of convex lenses (e.g., +4.0D). This is then gradually lessened by a small fraction (0.5D) until the maximum acuity is just reached. The first lens is not removed until the next is in position, to prevent from accommodation becoming active.</p>

<p class="noindent">There are two forms of ophthalmoscopy— direct and indirect.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch9lev2sec3"><h2 class="title">Direct Ophthalmoscopy (<a href="#ch9fig6" class="ulink-inter">Figs. 9.6A and B</a>)</h2>
<p class="noindent">The hand-held direct ophthalmoscope is designed to provide a direct magnified (X15) view of the fundus. The source of illumination is projected by means of a mirror or prism coinciding with the observer's line of vision through the aperture.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch9lev3sec4"><h3 class="title">Procedure</h3>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">The ophthalmoscope is held close to the observer's eye and approximately 15 cm from the patient's eye.</p></li>
<li><p class="">It is held in the right hand and observer uses his/her right eye to examine patient's right eye. Similarly to examine the patient's left eye, it is held in the left hand and the observer uses his/her left eye.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The patient should fix on a distant target with the eye as steady as possible.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The observer has to adjust ophthalmoscope power setting to accommodate for the patient's refractive error and/or his/her own.</p></li>
<li><p class="">If both patient and observer are emmetropic, the lens is set at 0. A red reflex will be seen and is considered normal.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Moving the ophthalmoscope as close to the patient's eye as possible and using the ‘plus’ or ‘minus’ lens, the observer will able to see central retina in details up to the equator.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Lens setting at more ‘plus’ power will focus the ophthalmoscope in the vitreous or more anterior.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch9lev2sec4"><h2 class="title">Indirect Ophthalmoscopy (<a href="#ch9fig7" class="ulink-inter">Figs. 9.7A and B</a>)</h2>
<p class="noindent">This technique is generally used by retina specialist and involves the use of ahead mounted; prism directed light source coupled with use of a high condensing lens (+14, +20 or +30D) to see the retinal image. A +20D condensing lens is most commonly used.</p>

<p class="indent">The retinal image formed by the indirect ophthalmoscopy <span class="italic">is inverted, real and capable of being seen at the focal plane of the lens</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent">The image is brilliantly illuminated, binocular stereoscopic one that covers approximately 10 times of the area compare to direct ophthalmoscope. The image is, however, smaller (X 3 times). It is essential to see retinal periphery to locate different types of lesions.</p>
<p class="noindent">Because of its stronger illumination, it allows light to pass through moderate opacities in the media which are obstructive to direct ophthalmoscope.</p>
