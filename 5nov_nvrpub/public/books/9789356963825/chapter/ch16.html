<p class="noindent">It is the internal pressure exerted by the intraocular fluids on the coats of the eyeball. The normal intraocular pressure (IOP) is between 10 mm Hg and 20 mm Hg (in contrast, the normal tissue pressure is about 2 mm Hg and intracranial pressure is 7 mm Hg).</p>
<p class="indent">Two main factors, concerned with the maintenance of IOP are the rate of secretion of aqueous humor and its rate of outflow from the eye. Most (75%) of the resistance to outflow is in the trabecular meshwork immediately adjacent to the canal of Schlemm <bold>(<a href="#ch16fig1" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 16.1</a>)</bold>.</p>
<p class="indent">The ease with which the fluid exits, is indicated as the <span class="italic">coefficient of the facility of outflow</span> (‘C’), and in the normal eyes is more than 0.2 µL/min/mm Hg of pressure within the eye. It is measured clinically by tonography.</p>
<p class="indent">Under normal conditions, the rate of aqueous production is relatively constant, so that, in clinical practice, the main determinants of IOP are the <span class="italic">resistance of exit channels,</span> and the <span class="italic">outflow pressure</span> (IOP minus episcleral venous pressure).</p>

<div class="section" id="ch16lev3sec1"><h3 class="title">Physiological Variations</h3>
<p class="noindent">The IOP normally fluctuates 2–5 mm Hg throughout the day.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">With respiration and heart beat:</span> The pressure fluctuates up to 5 mm Hg with each breath and 1–2 mm Hg with each heartbeat.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">With time of the day:</span> A characteristic diurnal variation is seen, with a minimum around 6.00 PM, and a peak on waking in the morning. In normal eyes, this difference seldom exceeds 3–4 mm, but in glaucoma it is often much higher.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">With the venous pressure:</span> The Valsalva maneuver causes a rise in episcleral venous pressure, reduces aqueous outflow, and temporarily elevates the IOP.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">With the arterial pressure:</span> Transient rise in IOP with the rise of systemic blood pressure.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">With the osmotic pressure of blood:</span> When plasma osmolarity rises (as with intravenous mannitol, or oral glycerol), the IOP falls, whereas reduced osmolarity (as with water drinking provocative test) raises IOP.<a name="page287"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">287</span></span></p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch16lev3sec2"><h3 class="title">Local Mechanical Factors</h3>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Dilatation of the pupil:</span> The IOP may rise if the anterior chamber is shallow, owing to a relative obstruction of the drainage angle by the iris.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Changes in the solid content of the eye:</span> A rise in IOP may result from rapid increase in size of the lens (intumescent cataract) or from the rapid growth of an intraocular neoplasm.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Pressure from outside:</span> IOP rises whenever the lids are closed, and forcible blepharospasm may cause rise of 5 mm or more; while contraction of rectus muscles may equally provoke a significant increase.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch16lev3sec3"><h3 class="title">Pharmacological Factors</h3>
<p class="noindent">The ciliary muscle is inserted into the trabeculum. So, the contraction of the ciliary muscle makes the trabecular meshwork more porous which increases the facility of outflow and reduces IOP.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Outflow facility:</span> Pilocarpine acts directly on the ciliary muscle to contract, and the simultaneous miosis is also important in relieving the pupillary block and obstruction of the drainage angle in acute glaucoma.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Outflow facility</span> is also increased by adrenaline and other β-blockers, and decreased by topical steroids.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Reduction of the aqueous production:</span> Adrenaline and carbonic anhydrase inhibitors are most important.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Atropine</span> produces a slight fall in IOP, possibly by facilitating the drainage of aqueous via uveoscleral route.</p></li>

<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Manometry:</span> It is measured by inserting a cannula, directly into the anterior chamber which is connected with a manometer. This is the most accurate method, but impossible in clinical practice, and only useful in experimental animals.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Digital tonometry (finger tension):</span> Intraocular tension is roughly assessed by digital palpation, fluctuating the down- turned eye between the two index fingers through the upper lid (above the tarsal plate) <bold>(<a href="#ch16fig2" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 16.2</a>)</bold>.</p>
<p class="">This is a routine clinical method and yields a fairly accurate assessment to experienced fingers. It is sometimes recorded as ‘+’, ‘++’, ‘+++’, if increasingly high, or ‘-’, ‘--’, ‘---’, if increasingly soft. In very high IOP—this fluctuation is absent <span class="italic">(stony hard)</span> and in very low IOP <span class="italic">(phthisis bulbi)</span>—it is <span class="italic">soft like a water bag.</span></p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Instrumental tonometry:</span> Intraocular tension is measured by two types of tonometer:
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">

<p class="noindent">It is constructed in such a way that, when placed on the eye, the plunger together with a present weight, indents the cornea.</p>
<p class="indent">The amount of indentation is measured on a scale, and then the corresponding intraocular tension <bold>(<a href="#ch16fig4" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 16.4B</a>)</bold> (in mm Hg) can be calculated from an accompanying table. The normal IOP in Schiotz tonometer is 14–20 mm Hg.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Advantages:</span> It is cheap, easy to use, convenient to carry and does not require a slit-lamp for measurement.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Disadvantages:</span> Schiotz tonometer <bold>(<a href="#ch16fig5" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 16.5</a>)</bold> is not so accurate, since the intraocular tension recorded, is influenced by ocular (scleral) rigidity.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class=""><span class="italic">Scleral rigidity</span> means resistance to distensibility of the outer coats of the eyeball, especially the sclera. Increased elasticity of the outer coats of the eye, is called <span class="italic">low scleral rigidity</span>. It may occur in high myopia, thyroid exophthalmos, miotic therapy and postoperative eyes. In these cases, Schiotz tonometer may record a falsely low reading of IOP when compared with an applanation tonometer.</p>
<p class="indent">Similarly, if the eye has an abnormally <span class="italic">high scleral rigidity</span> (as in hypermetropic eyes, microphthalmos) a falsely high level of IOP may be recorded.</p>
<p class="indent">Abnormalities of scleral rigidity can be detected with a Schiotz tonometer by using two different weights (e.g., 5.5 g and 10 g). If the two measurements are identical, then the scleral rigidity is normal. If there is a discrepancy, then the scleral rigidity is abnormal and the value can be determined by consulting <span class="italic">Friedenwald's nomogram.</span> The average normal coefficient of scleral rigidity is 0.0215.</p>
</div>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Applanation tonometer:</span> This is based on the principle of <span class="italic">Imbert-Fick's law</span>. It states that for an ideal, thin-walled sphere, the pressure inside the sphere (p) equals to the force necessary to flatten its surface (F) divided by the area of flattening (A), i.e., P = F/A.</p>

<p class="noindent">An applanation tonometer measures the IOP by flattening (rather than indent) the cornea over a specific area (applanation of circle with a diameter at 3.06 mm). This is more accurate since the pressure values recorded are not influenced by scleral rigidity.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square">
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Goldmann applanation tonometer (<a href="#ch16fig6" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 16.6</a>)</span> is mounted on a slit-lamp and a special plastic prism rests on the cornea, the pressure being adjusted until it achieves a standard disc of contact as outlined by a pre-instilled drop of fluorescein <bold>(<a href="#ch16fig7" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 16.7</a>)</bold>.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Perkins’ (hand-held) applanation tonometer (<a href="#ch16fig8" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 16.8</a>)</span> is similar except, that it does not require a slit-lamp, and it can be used even in supine position.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">The normal IOP in applanation tonometry (ATn) is 15.5 ± 2.5 mm of Hg. The normal IOP ranges from 10 to 21 mm of Hg. If a value is more than 21 mm of Hg, it is considered high IOP.</p>

<p class="noindent">Central corneal thickness (CCT) variations affect the apparent IOP as measured by applanation tonometer.

<p class="noindent">A CCT lower than 555 microns is an independent risk factor for the development of primary open angle glaucoma. When originally devised, it was believed that significant variations in corneal thickness were uncommon and a CCT of 520 µ was assumed in calibration of the Goldmann applanation tonometer.</p>
<p class="indent">In each case of suspected glaucoma, especially for the open angle type, it is necessary to measure the CCT by pachymetry. Again, the ultrasonic pachymeter is currently the gold standard.</p>
<p class="indent">Different nomograms (Ehlers’, Dresdner's, or Doudhty's) are used to correct IOP with CCT variations. But, no nomograms have been identified to this day to be full proof. <span class="italic">One may use 15 µ corneal thickness as being equivalent to 1 mm of Hg as a rough average to arrive at the corrected IOP reading.</span></p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="ch16lev3sec6"><h3 class="title">Acute Congestive Attack</h3>
<p class="noindent">An acute congestive attack occurs sooner or later, and is always associated with closure of the angle, and a severe elevation of IOP.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<h2 class="title">Pathology</h2>
<p class="">The crisis in acute attack is due to acute ischemia, perhaps, associated with the liberation of prostaglandin-like substances. If the attack lasts for several hours or days, irreversible damage may occur to the ocular tissues.</p>
<p class="indent">The effects on different ocular structures during and following an acute attack are:</p>
<p class=""><ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Accumulation of the fluid occurs</span> in all the layers of cornea. This is due to imbibition of fluid in the cornea caused by dysfunction of ‘endothelial pump’ owing to sharp rise in IOP.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Circumcorneal congestion and chemosis</span> of the conjunctiva, are due to stasis with increased permeability of the capillaries.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Peripheral anterior synechiae</span> occur as a result of prolonged or repeated acute congestive attacks. Initially, there is iridocorneal contact and later on, the contact becomes iridotrabecular.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Pupil is mid-dilated</span> and oval. Iris shows atrophic changes adjacent to the sphincter muscle. This is due to ischemia of the sphincter pupillae.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Glaucomfleckens</span> <bold>(<a href="#ch16fig16" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 16.16</a>)</bold> are small grayish-white anterior subcapsular opacities occur in the pupillary zone. They are diagnostic of previous attack of angle-closure glaucoma, and due to atrophy of the newly formed lens fibers.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Optic nerve head</span> is usually edematous and hyperemic, and is due to anterior ischemic optic neuropathy. Cupping of the optic disc is usually evident after 2 weeks, if the disease passes into chronic congestive phase.</p></li>

<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">The history of seeing <span class="italic">colored halos,</span></p></li>

<div class="section" id="ch16lev3sec9"><h3 class="title">Colored Halos</h3>
<p class="noindent">The colored halos are due to accumulation of fluid in the corneal epithelium and alterations in the refractive condition of the corneal lamellae. They are seen around the lighted bulb. The colors are distributed as in the spectrum of rainbow, with red being outside and violet innermost.</p>
<p class="indent">Similar colored halos may be seen in early immature cataract. These two can be differentiated by <span class="italic">Fincham's stenopeic slit test,</span> where a stenopeic slit is passed before the eye, across the line of vision. As it passes, a glaucomatous halo remains intact, but diminished in intensity, whereas a lenticular halo is broken up in segments which revolve as the slit is moved.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="">If the patient gives a vague history, the halo can be demonstrated to him, by his looking through a thin layer of lycopodium powder enclosed between two glass plates made up as a trial lens.</p>

<p class="indent">The purpose of gonioscopy <bold>(<a href="#ch16fig20" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 16.20</a>)</bold> is to identify abnormal angle structures, and to estimate the width of the chamber angle.</p>

<div class="section" id="ch16lev2sec11"><h2 class="title">Symptoms</h2>
<p class="noindent">Because of its insidious onset and silent nature, POAG is usually asymptomatic until it has caused a significant loss of visual field. However, the patient may present with:</p>

<p class="noindent">Patients with POAG frequently show a wider variation in IOP than normal individuals. A single pressure reading of 21 mm Hg or less does not exclude the diagnosis. So, it is necessary to measure the IOP at different times of the day.</p>
<p class="indent">Initially, there is a rhythmic swing in IOP, which is an exaggeration of normal diurnal variation. In most patients, the IOP falls during evening (contrary to what happens in angle-closure glaucoma).</p>

<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Confrontation technique:</span> It is a rough, but very useful clinical test which should be applied in every case, if there is any suspicion of a defect in visual field <span class="italic">(see</span> page 124).</p>
<p class="">It is useful in advanced glaucoma (not in early cases) and in neuro-ophthalmological lesions. If any defect is indicated by this method, it must be accurately mapped out and recorded with the perimeter.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Kinetic techniques:</span> This involves moving the test object from a non-seeing area, and recording the point at which it is first seen, in relation to fixation. <span class="italic">Two basic types</span> of screen are used for kinetic visual field testing.
<ul style="list-style-type: square">
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Perimeters:</span> The screen may be either an arc or a bowl of a radius of 330 mm.
<ul style="list-style-type: dash">
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Lister's perimeter:</span> A rotable arc, capable of being revolved round a pivot, and along which a test object can be moved.</p>
<p class=""><div class="figure" id="ch16fig31" data-label="Figs. 16.31A and B"><div class="title"><span class="item-label">Figs. 16.31A and B</span> <bold>A.</bold> Bean-pot cupping in cross-section; <bold>B.</bold> Bean-pot cupping of the optic disc.</div><img alt="Figs. 16.31A and B" src="/MediumImage/306-2.jpg"><div class="additional-markup"></div></div></p></li>
<li><p class=""><a name="page307"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">307</span></span><span class="italic">Goldmann's perimeter:</span> A hemi- spherical bowl, over which a target (a spot of light of adjustable size and illumination) can be directed.</p>
<p class="">The Goldmann's perimeter is more standardized, and is preferable for glaucoma examinations, as with this, both the central and peripheral visual fields can be recorded.</p>
<p class="">The targets of perimeter consist of circular white disc (or a spot of light) of diameters ranging from 1–10 mm. The <span class="italic">isopters</span> represent the limits of the field of vision with each target, and are accordingly labelled 1/330 (1 mm target at 330 mm distance the radius of perimeter), 2/330, 10/330, etc.</p>
<p class="">Colored discs or colored spots of light are exceptionally used for estimation of a differential field loss to color. In normal conditions, <span class="italic">the blue field is largest</span>, slightly smaller than the white; then follows the yellow, red, and green. The field for blue and yellow is roughly 10° less in each direction than that for white, that for red and green another 10° less.</p></li>
</ul></p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Tangent screen (Bjerrum screen):</span> It is a black felt or flannel, on which central 30° of the visual field can be studied. Estimation of defects of the central field (scotometry or campimetry) is performed with this screen.</p>
<p class="">The screen is normally 1 m square or 2 m square, with the patient is seated at 1 m or 2 m from the screen. With the patient fixing on a white button at the center of the screen, the examiner moves a target from the periphery toward fixation until the patient indicates recognition of the target. After plotting the blind spot, the procedure is repeated at various directions around the fixation point until the isopter has been mapped (and labelled as 1/1000, 2/1000, 3/1000, etc.). The blind spot normally covers an area, vertically oval, between 12°–18° temporal to the fixation point, and its edges are sharp and abrupt with any target (small or large).</p>
<p class="">Lister perimetry and Bjerrum screen scotometry have the advantages of low cost and simplicity of operation. They can elicit 80% of field defect, especially in advanced glaucoma. However, their values are limited in glaucoma investigation, as they cannot detect early glaucomatous field defect and are non-reproducible (which is essential for glaucoma management).</p></li>
</ul></p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Static techniques:</span> In static perimetry, the visual field can be plotted by using a stationary light target of variable brightness against a background whose luminance may be similarly adjusted (either in photo- pic or scotopic condition).</p>
<p class="">In general, the static perimetry is superior to kinetic methods for glaucoma patients, as it is more accurate and reproducible.</p></li>

<li><p class="">Trabeculectomy with antifibrotic agents, e.g., with Mitomycin-C (MMC) or 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). Here, these drugs act as wound modulators because of their anti-fibroblastic activities. So the chance of fibrosis and postoperative bleb failure is less.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Trabeculectomy with Ologen implant:</span> Ologen is a porcine-derived biodegradable collagen matrix implant which is an alternative to antifibrotic agents used as an adjunct to trabeculectomy.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Glaucoma drainage devices (shunt/ valve):</span> Examples are Molteno, Kurpin-Denver, Baerveldt implant, Ahmed glaucoma valve (AGV), or Aurolab aqueous drainage implant (AADI) are designed to divert aqueous humor from anterior chamber to an external reservoir, where a fibrous capsule forms about 4–6 weeks after surgery and regulates flow.</p>
<p class="">This is done in recalcitrant cases, like previously failed <span class="italic">trabeculectomy</span> and complicated glaucoma, such as uveitic glaucoma, neovascular glaucoma, iridocorneal endothelial (ICE) syndrome, pediatric glaucoma and also in conjunction with keratoprosthesis.</p>
<p class="">The tube is usually placed in the anterior chamber (rarely through pars plana route). In valved variety, when IOP rises, the valve opens and aqueous drains into the subconjunctival space; but as soon as the IOP decreases, the valve automatically closes.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Microinvasive glaucoma surgical (MIGS)</span> procedures are a group of operations which have been developed in recent years to reduce some of the complications of most standard glaucoma surgeries.
