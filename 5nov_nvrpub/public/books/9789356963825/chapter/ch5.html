<p class="noindent">Therapeutic substances may be introduced into the eye by two major routes—<span class="italic">systemic route</span> and <span class="italic">local route</span>.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Systemic routes:</span> Here, the drug can be given by mouth or by injections, but it has its obvious limitations because of <span class="italic">two blood-ocular barriers—</span>the blood-aqueous barrier, and the blood-retinal barrier.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">The blood-aqueous barrier:</span> It is formed by the nonpigmented layer of the ciliary epithelium, and by the endothelium of the iris vessels. Both of these tissues have tight junctions of the <span class="italic">leaky</span> type.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">The blood-retinal barrier:</span> It is located in the retinal pigment epithelium and the endothelium of the retinal blood vessels. Both of these tissues have tight junctions of <span class="italic">non-leaky</span> type.</p>
<p class="">Drugs enter the eye in proportion to their lipid solubility and smaller molecule size, e.g., sulfonamides has much better penetration than penicillins.</p>
<p class="">Severe inflammations and trauma damage the blood-ocular barriers and facilitate the penetration of the drugs in higher concentration.</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Local routes:</span> They are as follows:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square">
<li><p class="">Aqueous or viscous solutions, as drop</p></li>
<li><p class="">Ointments</p></li>
<li><p class="">Drug-impregnated contact lens</p></li>
<li><p class="">Membrane release system (ocusert)</p></li>
<li><p class="">Subconjunctival or sub-Tenon injections</p></li>
<li><p class="">Retrobulbar or peribulbar injection</p></li>
<li><p class="">Injections directly into the eye.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Corneal penetration:</span> Compounds applied to the anterior globe surface, enter the anterior chamber mainly through the cornea. Epithelium is permeable to the lipid-soluble compounds and stroma to the water-soluble compounds. Thus, the highest intraocular concentrations following administration of compounds should be both water and lipid soluble. Since epithelium is the main barrier, permeability is much increased, if the epithelium is damaged or abraded.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Eye drops:</span> They are most popular and easy to use. One drop instillation is enough for each time, as the conjunctival sac cannot retain more than that.</p>
<p class=""><span class="italic">Disadvantages:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square">
<li><p class="">Shorter duration of action.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Dilution of the drug by tears.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Drainage through the nasolacrimal duct leading to systemic toxicity.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Difficult for use in children.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Ointments:</span> They are specially useful for night application and also for children. Less systemic absorption via nasolacrimal duct. It also minimizes dilution and prolongs contact time.</p>
<p class=""><span class="italic">Disadvantages</span>:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square">
<li><p class="">It cannot be used during day time as it causes blurring of vision.<a name="page48"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">48</span></span></p></li>
<li><p class="">Allergic reaction to ointment or its base may occur.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Ocuserts</span> provide continuous release of a predetermined amount of drug over a period of 5–7 days. Ocusert (pilocarpine) was available earlier for glaucoma treatment and Lacrisert (polyvinyl alcohol) for dry eye management.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Drug-impregnated contact lens:</span> A soft contact lens is soaked in a compound, and when the lens is placed in contact with the cornea, it gradually releases the drug, e.g., pilocarpine for glaucoma treatment.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Subconjunctival or sub-Tenon injections</span> are popular for administration of antibiotics, corticosteroids, or atropine. This is useful at the end of intraocular operation, or treatment of corneal ulcer, or iridocyclitis. A high tissue concentration is maintained for a long time. Here, the route of penetration of drug is mainly via the cornea, though the injection sites are different <span class="italic">(see</span> <a href="/9789356963825/chapter/ch28" class="ulink-exter">Chapter 28</a>).</p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Injections into the eye</span>
<ul style="list-style-type: square">
<li><p class="">Either into the <span class="italic">anterior chamber (intra-cameral)</span> or <span class="italic">vitreous (intravitreal)</span> is reserved for desperate cases, especially in endophthalmitis.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Into the anterior chamber:</span> In intraocular lens implantation, e.g., <span class="italic">viscoelastic substance, adrenaline</span> to dilate pupil, preservative free lignocaine for iris anesthesia in topical phacoemulsification, and <span class="italic">pilocarpine</span> to constrict the pupil.</p></li>
</ul></p></li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="ch5lev2sec1"><h2 class="title">Intravitreal Injections</h2>
<p class="noindent">Injecting drugs directly into the vitreous cavity is indicated in various posterior segment pathologies. Some patients may require multiple injections.</p>
<p class="noindent">The various drugs given intravitreally are:</p>
<p class="indent">Steroids are sometimes administered as slow release implants for prolonged duration of action. The commonly used implants are: dexamethasone implant—Ozurdex, and fluocinolone implant Retisert and Iluvien.</p>

<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Topical antibiotics:</span> They are generally required to eliminate superficial bacterial infections.
<ul style="list-style-type: square">
<li><p class="">Chloramphenicol (0.5%), tetracycline (1%), ciprofloxacin (0.3%), moxifloxacin (0.5%) or gatifloxacin (0.3% and 0.5%) have broad-spectrum effectivity.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Gentamycin (0.3%), ciprofloxacin (0.3%), tobramycin (1%), and polymyxin-B are more effective against Gram-negative bacilli.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Moxifloxacin, gatifloxacin, vancomycin, ceftazidime, and cefazoline has better sensitivity against Gram-positive organism.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Neomycin (0.5%) is also useful only in Gram ‘+ve’ infections and causes local allergy in many cases.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Freshly prepared crystalline penicillin drops remain stable only for a week or 10 days, and is specifically used to treat <span class="italic">gonococcal</span> infections.</p></li>
</ul></p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Systemic antibiotics:</span> Oral and intramuscular or intravenous injections are required to eliminate intraocular infections, and in soft tissue infections. Newer penicillin preparations (such as, cefazoline and other cephalosporins) are having higher penetration in intra-ocular tissues.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Subconjunctival antibiotics:</span> They are best for treating deep seated infections, as high concentrations are maintained in aqueous for a prolonged period, e.g., gentamycin, amikacin, vancomycin, etc.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Intraocular injections of antibiotics</span>: Either into the anterior chamber or the vitreous, may be necessary for intractable ocular suppuration, as in endophthalmitis. Gentamycin, ceftazidime, amikacin or vancomycin is usually used along with corticosteroids. But they may cause damage to the corneal endothelium or retina (macular damage or venous occlusion).</p></li>
<li><p class="">Vancomycin has been recently reported to cause hemorrhagic occlusive retinal vasculitis (HORV).</p></li>

</div><div class="section" id="ch5lev1sec4"><h1 class="title">ANTIVIRALS</h1>
<p class="noindent">Chemotherapy of ocular viral infections is concerned mainly with keratitis caused by <span class="italic">Herpes simplex virus (HSV)</span>, and also to some extent by <span class="italic">Herpes zoster virus.</span></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Acyclovir</span> is effective both topically and systemically. It is used as 3% ointment for 5 times daily, or oral tablets (200–400 mg) 5 times daily for 7–10 days in herpes simplex keratitis.
<ul style="list-style-type: square">
<li><p class="">The prophylactic oral dose of Acyclovir: 200 or 400 mg bid for next 6 months to prevent recurrence.</p></li>

</ul></p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Ganciclovir ophthalmic gel (0.15%):</span> It is equally effective as acyclovir ointment in acute HSV keratitis. It is given 5 times daily for 7–14 days depending upon the response. Toxicity includes, irritation, blurring of vision, superficial punctate keratitis (SPKs), follicular reaction, etc.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">TFT (Trifluorothymidine or F</span>3<span class="italic">T)</span> is given as 3% drop for 5 times daily. It has less toxicity, greater potency and greater effectiveness in resistance cases.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Vidarabine (Ara-A)</span> as 3% ointment. Generally, it is more potent than IDU and active against IDU-resistant virus.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Idoxuridine (IDU) or 5-iodo-2-deoxy-uridine</span> inhibits the synthesis of DNA: It was used earlier as 0.1% eye drop or 0.5% ointment.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Valaciclovir or valacyclovir:</span> It is an antiviral drug used in the management of severe HSV, herpes zoster ophthalmicus (HZO) and CMV infection of the eye. It is a prodrug, being converted <span class="italic">in vivo</span> to acyclovir. It is given orally 500–1000 mg bid or tid doses for 7–10 days, and prophylactically used 1 tab daily for next 6 months.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Ganciclovir:</span> The first antiviral agent for the treatment of <span class="italic">cytomegalovirus (CMV)</span> retinitis.

</div><div class="section" id="ch5lev1sec5"><h1 class="title">ANTIFUNGALS</h1>
<p class="noindent">The available antifungal drugs are fungistatic in nature. They are mainly used in <span class="italic">kerato-mycosis</span> and <span class="italic">fungal endophthalmitis</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent">Three groups of agents are used:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Polyenes:</span> Natamycin, amphotericin B, and nystatin.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Imidazoles:</span> Voriconazole, ketoconazole, miconazole, econazole, fluconazole, itraconazole, etc.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Flucytosine:</span> 5-fluorocytosine.</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Natamycin</span> is used topically as 5% suspension. It has fairly broad-spectrum effect against <span class="italic">Fusarium</span> and <span class="italic">Aspergillus</span>, and least against <span class="italic">Candida</span>. It is the most commonly used antifungal.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Amphotericin-B</span> is too toxic for systemic use but may be used locally as 0.15–0.25% solution (made in 5% dextrose solution or in distilled water)—as eye drop at 1-hour interval. As this solution is preservative-free, it should be discarded after 4 days.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Nystatin</span> is used topically (as 100,000 units/mL) in fungal keratitis—particularly effective against <span class="italic">Candida</span> species. It is less potent.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Voriconazole</span> has very good broad-spectrum antifungal activity. It may be given orally (200 mg bid) or as a topical (1%) preparation. It is more effective against <span class="italic">Aspergillus</span> and <span class="italic">Candida</span> than <span class="italic">Fusarium</span>. It may be used as adjunct therapy or monotherapy. It is expensive.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Ketoconazole</span> is a well-tolerated oral antifungal drug. It is not effective against <span class="italic">Fusarium</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Itraconazole</span> (100 mg bid) orally and <span class="italic">econazole</span> as 2% topical preparation are sometimes used with other topical antifungals in resistant cases.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Fluconazole</span> is also a well-tolerated oral drug and has broader spectrum of antifungal activity. It is used as 200 mg daily for 3–4 weeks. It is also available as 0.3% solution, as 1 hourly drop in fungal corneal ulcer.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Flucytosine</span> is a less effective agent and used systemically. It is not much useful in oculomycosis.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Newer antifungals:</span> Recently newer antifungals-like posaconazole (azole group) and caspofungin (echinocandins group) are used in refractory fungal corneal ulcer.</p>
</div><div class="section" id="ch5lev1sec6"><h1 class="title">AUTONOMIC DRUGS</h1>
<p class="noindent">Autonomic drugs act on sphincter and dilator pupillae muscles of the iris, and also on the ciliary muscles. They are <span class="italic">miotics</span> (pupil constricting), <span class="italic">mydriatics</span> (pupil dilating) or <span class="italic">cycloplegics</span> (drugs causing paralysis of accommodation).</p>
<div class="section" id="ch5lev2sec2"><h2 class="title">Miotics</h2>
<p class="noindent">Miotics are the drugs which cause miosis or pupillary constriction.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="italic">Systemically</span> used drug, e.g., morphine is a strong miotic.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch5lev3sec1"><h3 class="title">Topical Miotics</h3>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Cholinergic drugs</span> are of three types:
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Direct stimulant</span> at myoneural junction as acetylcholine, e.g., pilocarpine (1–4%), methacholine.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Indirect stimulant</span> by abolishing the effects of cholinesterase enzyme, i.e., <span class="italic">anticholinesterase,</span> e.g., eserine, <a name="page51"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">51</span></span>(0.25–1%), neostigmine, demecarium bromide, diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP) (0.1%), phospholine iodide (0.06–0.25%), etc.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Combination</span> of direct and indirect actions—carbachol and urecholine.</p></li>
</ol></p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Sympatholytic miotics:</span> They are rarely used topically, although thymoxamine (0.5%) solution is a powerful miotic, used as an antidote of phenylephrine.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Miosis can be induced by direct stimulation with histamine.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent"><span class="italic">All miotics stimulate the ciliary muscles to contract, so that the eye assumes a state of partial or complete accommodation.</span> This is observed with long-acting anticholinesterases, e.g., DFP, phospholine iodide, etc.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch5lev4sec1"><h4 class="title">Uses of miotics</h4>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Almost in all cases of glaucoma including primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG) or primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG).</p></li>
<li><p class="">In the treatment of accommodative convergent squint.</p></li>
<li><p class="">May be useful in accommodation weakness.</p></li>
<li><p class="">During cataract surgery, after placing a posterior chamber (PC) intraocular lens (IOL) or before placement of an anterior chamber (AC) IOL (with dilute pilocarpine directly into the anterior chamber).</p></li>
<li><p class="">May be used to counteract the effect of mydriatics, used for ophthalmic examination.</p></li>
<li><p class="">During different types of keratoplasty procedures—as in penetrating keratoplasty (PK in phakic cases), anterior lamellar and endothelial keratoplasty.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Miotics for presbyopia treatment:</span> Recently Pilocarpine 1.25% eye drop is approved by FDA for temporary treatment of presbyopia. Dose: one drop daily in both eyes and the effect lasts for 6 hours.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The other miotics—e.g., carbachol and phentolamine are in the pipeline. The main aim is to make the pupil size smaller to get pinhole effect, and to achieve a state of partial accommodative state for few hours.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch5lev2sec3"><h2 class="title">Mydriatics and Cycloplegics</h2>
<p class="noindent">Pupil dilating drugs are called <span class="italic">mydriatics</span>. All drugs which dilate the pupil also paralyze the accommodation in greater or lesser degree, due to paralysis of the ciliary muscles (cycloplegia).</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="italic">Systemically</span> used atropine causes pupillary dilatation.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch5lev3sec2"><h3 class="title">Topical Mydriatics</h3>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Parasympatholytic mydriatics:</span> They abolish the action of acetylcholine and, thus, cause mydriasis by making it impossible for the sphincter muscle to contract, e.g., atropine (1%), homatropine (1–2%), hyoscine (0.1–1%), cyclopentolate (0.5–1%) and tropicamide (0.5–1%).</p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Sympathomimetic mydriatics:</span> Directly act on dilator pupillae to produce mydriasis, e.g., adrenaline (1 in 10,000) as intracameral injection (into AC), phenylephrine drop (2.5–10%), and cocaine hydrochloride.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">Phenylephrine has little effect on ciliary muscles and therefore, should not be considered as a cycloplegic. But other parasympatholytic drugs are all cycloplegics.</p>
<p class="indent">Among these, <span class="italic">atropine</span> is the strongest cycloplegic agent, and the effect lasts for 10–14 days. <span class="italic">Homatropine</span> is moderately effective and its effect lasts for 48–72 hours.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="italic">Cyclopentolate</span> and <span class="italic">tropicamide</span> are very rapidly acting drops, the effect of which last only for 12–14 hours.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch5lev4sec2"><h4 class="title">Uses of mydriatics</h4>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">

</ul>
<p class="indent">Indomethacin, flurbiprofen or diclofenac eye drop is used along with mydriatics for prolonging the mydriatic effect during intraocular surgery.</p>
<p class="indent">Combination of mydriatic cycloplegic is always better except in refraction, e.g., homatropine and phenylephrine, tropicamide and phenylephrine, etc.</p>
<p class="indent">Mydriatics should not be used in angle- closure glaucoma, or very shallow anterior chamber. In case of operated anterior chamber or iris-fixation IOL—they should be used with caution.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div><div class="section" id="ch5lev1sec7"><h1 class="title">LOCAL ANESTHETICS</h1>
<p class="noindent">The small size of the eye and the accessibility of its nerve supply permit most adult ocular surgeries to be done under local anesthesia.</p>
<p class="indent">They are of two types—<span class="italic">topical</span> and <span class="italic">infiltrative</span>.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch5lev2sec4"><h2 class="title">Topical Anesthetics</h2>
<p class="noindent">They work by stabilizing the nerve membrane potential temporarily, so that it cannot be depolarized. They are:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Lignocaine hydrochloride (4%). About 2% may also be useful.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Tetracaine (0.5%)</p></li>
<li><p class="">Proparacaine (0.5%)</p></li>
<li><p class="">Amethocaine (0.5%)</p></li>
<li><p class="">Cocaine (2–4%): Also causes mydriasis.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">Among these amethocaine and proparacaine, although less potent, are less damaging to the corneal epithelium. They are especially useful in tonometry or gonioscopy.</p>
<p class="indent">Nowadays, most of the adult cataract surgery, refractive surgeries and other small surface procedures done under topical anesthesia—using lignocaine, proparacaine or with tetracaine drops 3 times 5 minutes before surgery. In cataract and other surgeries—1% preservative-free lignocaine is used intracamerally (injected into the A/C) to anesthetize the iris tissue.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch5lev2sec5"><h2 class="title">Infiltrative Anesthetics</h2>
<p class="noindent">Simultaneous motor and sensory block are obtained by infiltration of anesthetic agents in and around the eyeball.</p>
<p class="indent">They may be <span class="italic">facial block</span> (to paralyze orbicularis oculi muscle,) <span class="italic">retrobulbar block, peribulbar block, regional block of the eyelids</span> (to excise local lesion), etc.</p>
<p class="indent">For infiltration, lignocaine (2%) is normally used. <span class="italic">Bupivacaine</span> (0.5%), a long-acting local anesthetic agent is usually mixed with lignocaine (50:50) to achieve better and prolonged anesthetic effect.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="italic">Adrenaline</span> (1 in 100,000) prolongs the effect of anesthesia by inducing vasospasm in the injected area, but with slower action.</p>
<p class="indent">It also reduces the chance of bleeding during surgery, especially in oculoplasty procedures.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="italic">Hyaluronidase</span> enhances the dispersion and absorption of local infiltrative anesthetic agents. The increased dispersion makes possible, a more effective motor block. But it limits the duration of anesthetic effect.</p>

</div><div class="section" id="ch5lev1sec9"><h1 class="title">CORTICOSTEROIDS</h1>
<p class="noindent">The corticosteroids reduce the inflammatory responses of the ocular tissues by:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Decreasing capillary permeability,</p></li>
<li><p class="">Limiting exudation and</p></li>
<li><p class="">Inhibiting the formation of new vessels and granulation tissue.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">They inhibit the cyclo-oxygenase and lipoxygenase pathways by inhibiting phospholipase A2, thereby inhibiting the release of arachidonic acid.</p>
<p class="indent">All corticosteroids are prepared as ketone- based formulation except loteprednol which is prepared as ester-based formulation. They stay within the tissue more with good therapeutic effects and the same time with more toxicity. Whereas, enzymatic degradation occurs quickly with loteprednol; and it is less potent with less toxicity.</p>

<p class="noindent">Triamcinolone acetonide (TA) is an intermediate acting, relatively powerful steroid. It blocks the breakdown of the blood-ocular barrier by modifying the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor. It is used in both anterior as well as posterior segment disorders.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Giant papillae and vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC):</span> A supratarsal injection of triamcinolone is useful in VKC presenting with giant cobble-stone papillae and which is refractory to conventional treatment. Usually 0.5 mL (20 mg) is injected bilaterally. It results in a dramatic improvement in the size of the papillae, limbal involvement, itching and size of shield ulcers.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Sub-Tenon injection of triamcinolone:</span> A posterior sub-Tenon injection of 20 mg TA is useful in resolving CME due to posterior segment inflammation, e.g., uveitis, diabetes, post-cataract surgery, post-venous occlusion. However, IOP must be carefully monitored post injection.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide:</span> It is useful in the management of postuveitic macular edema, pseudophakic macular edema, post-branch retinal vein occlusion central retinal vein occlusion (post-BRVO/ CRVO) macular edema and in choroidal neovascularization. This injection must be preservative free TA preparation. Post- injection endophthalmitis and secondary glaucoma are serious complications.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Chromovitrectomy:</span> Triamcinolone acetamide has the ability to adhere to and stain the vitreous. Thus, it is a helpful tool in visualizing the vitreous during vitrectomy, both in the anterior and posterior segment. This injection should also be preservative free.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Triamcinolone (0.1%) eye ointment:</span> Used in cases of atopic keratoconjunctivitis or other allergic disorders of conjunctiva or lids.</p></li>
</ul>
</div><div class="section" id="ch5lev1sec11"><h1 class="title">NONSTEROIDAL ANTI-INFLAMMATORY DRUGS</h1>
<p class="noindent">As the corticosteroids have many complications, some nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs) are being used recently. They are as follows:</p>

<p class="indent">They are mainly used as eye drops except indomethacin which is commonly used as oral medicine.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="">They are mainly anti-prostaglandins. They compete with the arachidonic acid for cyclo-oxygenase binding, thereby prevent conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandins.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch5lev2sec9"><h2 class="title">Uses</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Prevent intraoperative miosis during intraocular surgery. It is used with mydriatics in routine practice just before surgery.</p></li>

<div class="section" id="ch5lev2sec17"><h2 class="title">Preservative Toxicity</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Primary concern with many preservatives is not their value or efficacy, but rather their recognized cytotoxic side effects.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Although intermittent use of preserved multidose eye drops in normal individuals is probably not harmful, but high concentration (or prolonged and frequent use) of some preservatives can cause inflammation and damage to the ocular surface, specially, in patient with dry eye or glaucoma.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Preservative-induced toxicity does not have distinct signs or symptomatology. So, damage due to ophthalmic preservatives often goes undiagnosed.</p></li>

</ul>
</div>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Detergent preservatives</span></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square">
<li><p class="">They act upon microorganisms by altering cell membrane permeability and lysing the cytoplasmic content, e.g., benzalkonium chloride (BAK), Polyquad, chlorobutanol and thimerosal.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Ocular toxicity can occur because some detergent preservatives can affect eukaryotic cells and thus, cause ocular surface damage.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Oxidative preservatives</span></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square">
<li><p class="">They are usually smaller molecules that penetrate the bacterial cell membranes and interfere with their cellular function.</p></li>

</div>
<div class="section" id="ch5lev2sec19"><h2 class="title">Common Ocular Preservatives</h2>
<div class="section" id="ch5lev3sec14"><h3 class="title">Benzalkonium Chloride</h3>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Benzalkonium chloride is a quaternary ammonium compound and is often used in conjunction with disodium <span class="italic">ethylene diamine tetra acetic</span> acid (EDTA).</p></li>
<li><p class="">Edetate sodium is an additive which augments the preservative activity of BAK. However, it is not a true preservative by itself. This is just to lower the concentration of primary preservatives.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Benzalkonium chloride is the <span class="italic">most common</span> and <span class="italic">gold standard</span> preservative used in topical multidose vials for many years. It is chemically stable, does not degrade easily, even at a higher temperature. It is usually used at a concentration of 0.01% to 0.02%. BAK acts upon microorganisms by altering cell membrane permeability and lysing cytoplasmic contents.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Benzalkonium chloride does not appear to have significant adverse effects unless its frequency exceeds four to six times per day. This becomes a concern when patients use other drops on top of chronic medications, such as glaucoma drops or tears substitutes.</p></li>
<li><p class="">We need to be careful with its use in patients when they are using several medications; are overdoses or have a history of compromised corneal epithelium.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch5lev3sec15"><h3 class="title">Polyquad (Polyquaternium-1)</h3>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">It is a new polymeric quaternary ammonium preservative and it has less toxic effect on corneal epithelial cells than BAK.</p></li>
<li><p class="">It does not go into deep level and only cause superficial epithelial damage compared to BAK. It is used as 0.001% in ophthalmic solution.<a name="page63"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">63</span></span></p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch5lev3sec16"><h3 class="title">Chlorobutanol</h3>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">It is an alcohol-based preservative; so it does not have surfactant action. It works by disorganizing the lipid structure of the cell membrane which increases cell permeability and leads to cell lysis.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Chlorobutanol has broad-spectrum anti- microbial activity. It is used as 0.5% in ophthalmic preparation and in human corneal epithelial cells, the cytotoxic effects are less severe.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch5lev3sec17"><h3 class="title">Thimerosal</h3>
<p class="noindent">It is used as 0.001–0.004% in ophthalmic drops. It causes cellular retraction, cessation of mitotic activity, and superficial corneal epithelial cell loss.</p>

<div class="section" id="ch5lev2sec20"><h2 class="title">Noble Preservatives</h2>
<div class="section" id="ch5lev3sec19"><h3 class="title">Stabilized Oxychloro Complex or Purite</h3>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Stabilized oxychloro complex (SOC) is a relatively new preservative and consists of an equilibrium mixture of oxychloro compounds—99.5% chlorite (ClO<sub>2</sub>–), 0.5% chlorate (ClO<sub>3</sub>–) and trace amount of chlorine dioxide (ClO<sub>2</sub>).</p></li>
<li><p class="">It has bactericidal, fungicidal and viricidal activity.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Stabilized oxychloro complex dissipates by converting into component normally found in tears, such as sodium ion (Na<sup>+</sup>), chloride-ion (Cl<sup>–</sup>), oxygen and water. Due to oxidation potential of chlorite and possibly from the generation of chlorine dioxide in presence of acidic environments of the microbes, it leads to disruption of the protein synthesis and thereby kill them.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Sodium chlorite, the key component of SOC, has been used in water purification plants since 1944. It is also used in tooth paste, mouth wash and some antacids. SOC has wide spectrum of antimicrobial activities at a low concentration of 0.005% w/v.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch5lev3sec20"><h3 class="title">Sodium Perborate (<a href="#ch5fig1" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 5.1</a>)</h3>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">It works by oxidizing cell walls or membranes and thereby disrupting the cellular functions. It destroys most bacteria, and can also destroy some viruses and most of the fungi.</p></li>
<li><p class="">When sodium perborate is combined with water it is converted into hydrogen peroxide, an effective antimicrobial agent. Once sodium perborate enters the eye, it is decomposed to water and oxygen by catalase and other enzymes present in the tear film. It is much gentler than any other preservatives.</p></li>
