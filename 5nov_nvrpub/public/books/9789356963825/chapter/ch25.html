<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">For eye operations which are not urgent, it is essential to have the patient in a good state of health as possible.</p></li>
<li><p class="">There must be no septic lesions (e.g., infected teeth, or otitis media).</p></li>
<li><p class="">A broad-spectrum antibiotic drop (e.g., gatifloxacin or moxifloxacin) is started 3–4 times daily for 3 days prior to surgery.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Lacrimal passages are irrigated, and any evidence of infection is noted, the presence of which will necessitate dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR) or dacryocystectomy (DCT) operation before any intraocular surgical procedures.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Diabetes and hypertension must be controlled.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Cardiovascular, respiratory and renal diseases must receive medical attention.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Hemorrhagic tendency must be investigated routinely.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The patient should not smoke for one week before operation and about one month after it.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The psychological state of the patient is reviewed, and every effort is made to encourage a state of optimism.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Fitness for general anesthesia is required for children, very nervous and mentally challenged patients and for extensive operations.</p></li>

<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Day of Admission (1-day Before Surgery):</span></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Informed written consent for operation.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Antibiotic drops are instilled frequently.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Mild tranquillizer at bedtime.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Tab acetazolamide; 1–2 tablet at night (for cataract or glaucoma surgery).</p></li>
<li><p class="">Lashes of upper and lower lids are cut short (many surgeons now prefer to leave the lashes uncut, relying on the speculum and drape to isolate them from the operative field).</p></li>
<li><p class="">Mild purgative if necessary.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Day of Operation:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Light breakfast in the morning.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Shaving for male patients.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The face is washed thoroughly with soap and water.</p></li>

<li><p class="">Blood pressure is checked, and if necessary, antihypertensive drugs are to be administered.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Appropriate premedication for general anesthesia.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Mild sedative if required.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Tablet acetazolamide—2 tablets, may be given 1–2 hours before surgery, if necessary.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Injection mannitol (20%) 200–300 mL, is given intravenously at least 30 minutes before surgery (for young and selective <a name="page466"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">466</span></span>patients with high intraocular pressure (IOP).</p></li>
<li><p class="">Start dilating the pupil (when necessary) with phenylephrine and tropicamide (or phenylephrine and homatropine) along with flurbiprofen or nepafenac eye drop 3–4 times 1 hour before surgery.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Flurbiprofen or nepafenac eye drops prevent intraoperative miosis, and also decreases postoperative pain and inflammation.</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="ch25lev2sec1"><h2 class="title">Day Care Eye Surgery</h2>
<p class="noindent">In recent years, there has been a major switch from inpatient care to day care for ophthalmic surgeries, provided to the patients who do not require overnight hospital stay. Rate of day care cataract surgery is as high as 100% in Denmark and as low as 0% in Austria. In India, about 80% cataract surgery is performed as day care basis.</p>
<p class="noindent">This change has been accepted by the patients and treating surgeon. This has been greatly facilitated by the advent of small incision cataract surgery (Phaco or SICS); newer microsurgical procedures in retina, glaucoma, cornea or oculoplasty.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch25lev3sec1"><h3 class="title">Advantages of Day Care Surgery</h3>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Less requirement of hospital beds</p></li>
<li><p class="">Cost saving for the patients and caregivers</p></li>
<li><p class="">Less nosocomial infections</p></li>
<li><p class="">Early recovery in home environment with the family</p></li>
<li><p class="">Insurance/Medicare prefers day care surgery.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">Day care surgery demands the highest standards of professional skills and management. Patient selection is the key of success of day care surgery. Sometimes, concept of day care surgery may not be acceptable to the patient and relatives.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch25lev3sec2"><h3 class="title">Disadvantages of Day Care Surgery</h3>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">For far away patients</p></li>
<li><p class="">Physically unfit patients</p></li>
<li><p class="">Children and mentally challenged patients</p></li>
<li><p class="">If close monitoring is required after surgery</p></li>
<li><p class="">In some eye surgeries, like retina or cornea surgeries, head positioning is important.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">In adults above 40 years, in addition to complete blood count (CBC), electrocardiography (ECG) and serum glucose are advised. The detailed preoperative assessment by the anesthetist is similar to inpatients surgery.</p>
<p class="noindent">After the surgery, the vital signs are monitored till the patient is discharged. The first follow-up is usually recommended for the next day.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div><div class="section" id="ch25lev1sec3"><h1 class="title">POSTOPERATIVE CARE AND TREATMENT</h1>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Avoid unnecessary jerky movements of the head and the body; and eye rubbing.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Avoid sudden strain, e.g., sneezing, coughing, weightlifting, etc.</p></li>
<li><p class="">While the patient is in bed, he should be made comfortable. It is preferable to place the patient at night, either supine or onto the unoperated side.</p></li>
<li><p class="">As the wound security is excellent, prolonged bed rest is unnecessary, on the other hand, early mobility is encouraged for the elderly patients.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Postoperative pain, which comes on half to one hour after the operation, must be treated with analgesics.</p></li>
<li><p class="">A mild sedative is useful to promote sleep for some patients.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Some disturbance of bowel rhythm is expected for a few days following major surgery. This should not cause concern unless the patient is suffering from discomfort. This can be easily tackled by mild laxatives.</p></li>
<li><p class="">A normal, easily digestible balanced diet is reintroduced from the next day.</p></li>
<li><p class="">A postoperative dressing is important to protect a healing wound from injury and exogenous infection to afford support and to soak up the discharge for first 24 hours.<a name="page467"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">467</span></span></p></li>
<li><p class="">An eye pad is better replaced by a protective dark glasses, or a shield, after 4 to 24 hours. It may be better to use the dark glasses during night to avoid accidental trauma by finger or by a corner of a pillowcase.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The patient is instructed to clean the ocular discharge daily in the morning with sterile cotton (in boiling water).</p></li>
<li><p class="">Instillation of eye drop and application of ointment at bed time as directed by the treating surgeon.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Removal of sutures:</span>

</div><div class="section" id="ch25lev1sec4"><h1 class="title">ANESTHESIA AND AKINESIA</h1>
<p class="noindent">A good anesthesia, either local anesthesia (LA) or general anesthesia (GA), is essential for smoother surgery to save sight and indeed a bad anesthesia may be disastrous.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch25lev2sec2"><h2 class="title">Local Anesthesia</h2>
<p class="noindent">Most eye surgeons still prefer to perform cataract and other operations under topical (surface) or local (injection) anesthesia.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch25lev3sec3"><h3 class="title">Advantages</h3>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">It is easy to administer, and there is no need of trained anesthetist (though an anesthetist is required in the operation theatre as a protocol to handle any systemic emergency).</p></li>
<li><p class="">Patients can cooperate during surgery.</p></li>
<li><p class="">It does not require any special and costly investigations.</p></li>
<li><p class="">There is no major complication of GA, e.g., cardiorespiratory problems, coughing, vomiting, etc. Immediate postoperative recovery is uneventful.</p></li>
<li><p class="">It is less expensive.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch25lev3sec4"><h3 class="title">Disadvantages</h3>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">It is difficult and sometimes hazardous for the nervous and noncooperative patients.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Head movements and straining may cause serious complications.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Neurocardiogenic shock (Vasovagal syncope) may also occur in susceptible individuals.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Rarely, there may be globe perforation, (1 in 16,000), which is sight-threatening.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch25lev2sec3"><h2 class="title">General Anesthesia</h2>

Manual or non-phaco techniques are becoming popular in the developing countries <bold>(<a href="#ch25fig13" class="ulink-inter">Figs. 25.13A to L</a>)</bold>. Phacoemulsification (phaco) technique is the excellent procedure of doing SICS.

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Irrigation:</span> It is a gravity flow system, and the fluid BSS is allowed to flow to the phaco handpiece <bold>(<a href="#ch25fig16" class="ulink-inter">Figs. 25.16A and B</a>)</bold> being used, through foot switching.</p></li>

<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Selection of the patient (difficulty in eyes with supra hard nucleus) with dilated pupil.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Most of the surgeons prefer under topical anesthesia.</p></li>
<li><p class="">A 2.2 mm to 2.8 mm clear corneal incision on temporal side. This is for foldable IOL. It is preferable to create two-step or three-step incision (for phaco with rigid lens a 5.5 mm posterior-limbal tunnel or sclerocorneal tunnel is required; internal incision in that case will be 2.8 mm for entry of phaco tip).</p></li>
<li><p class="">Viscoelastic agent is injected into the anterior chamber.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Continuous curvilinear capsulorhexis is performed using a bent-tipped 26-gauge needle or rhexis (utarata) forceps.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Hydrodissection and hydrodelamination to separate lens nucleus and cortex from the capsular bag.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Sculpting the lens nucleus from the anterior surface.</p></li>
<li><p class="">A phaco chopper is passed into the anterior chamber through a separate stab incision.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The chopper keeps the nucleus away from the corneal endothelium, simultaneously fragments the nucleus and feeds smaller pieces of nucleus into the ultrasonic tip, until the whole nucleus is fragmented and aspirated. The different techniques used are—chip and flip technique for soft nucleus, four quadrant divide and conquer technique, stop and chop technique or direct chop technique for nucleus fragmentation and emulsification.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Epinucleus removal by phaco probe.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Lens cortex is aspirated completely from the peripheral part, using bimanual irrigation and aspiration probes.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Polishing of the posterior capsule, if necessary.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Viscoelastic is injected to inflate the capsular bag.</p></li>
<li><p class="">A foldable IOL is implanted within capsular bag using IOL injector system [incision is enlarged to 5.5 mm for insertion of a rigid polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) PCIOL in-the-bag].</p></li>

<li><p class="">Hydration of the side port(s).</p></li>

<p class="noindent">This is most commonly practiced cyclodestructive procedure, which involves freezing of the ciliary body, to reduce the rate of aqueous produc<bold>ti</bold>on.</p>

</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch25lev2sec21"><h2 class="title">Mechanism</h2>
<p class="noindent">Cyclocryotherapy destroys the ability of the ciliary body to produce aqueous humor.</p>
<p class="indent">This is by destruction of the ciliary epithelial cells, due to intracellular ice crystal formation and ischemic necrosis.</p>
<p class="indent">In addition, it provides relief of pain by destruction of the corneal nerves.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch25lev2sec22"><h2 class="title">Steps</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Surface and retrobulbar anesthesia.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The nearest edge of the glaucoma cryo-probe is placed 2.5 mm from the limbus.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Cryoprobe is applied for 60 seconds, at a temperature of −60 to −80°C. A rapid freeze, and slow unassisted thaw is desirable, as it produces maximum cell death.</p></li>

<li><p class="">Two or more sessions may be required for a few patients.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">Intense postoperative pain (for first 24 hours), is treated with strong analgesics. In addition, topical corticosteroids and cycloplegics are to be used from the day of surgery.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Complications:</span> Excessive treatment may cause uveitis, hyphema, vitreous opacities, iris atrophy, pupillary distortion and hypotony (phthisis bulbi).</p>
</div>
</div><div class="section" id="ch25lev1sec13"><h1 class="title">CYCLOPHOTOCOAGULATION</h1>
<p class="noindent">Cyclophotocoagulation (CPC) is also another way to perform cyclodestruction. It can be performed using different laser wavelengths. Previously, neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd:YAG) laser was used for CPC.</p>
<p class="indent">But, presently, diode laser (810 nm wavelength) is preferred to perform CPC over other wavelengths since the melanin in the ciliary epithelium better absorbs this wavelength than others and therefore causes more targeted destruction with less inflammation.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Two main types of CPC:</span> Transscleral CPC (TS-CPC) or endocyclophotocoagulation (ECP). TS-CPC requires LA (retrobulbar or peribulbar) and can often be performed in outpatient department (OPD) setting. ECP requires local (topical with intracameral, retrobulbar/peribulbar block) or general anesthesia and is performed in operation theatre setting.</p>
<p class="indent">Both are performed for similar glaucoma conditions. In general, TS-CPC and ECP are indicated for refractory glaucoma, or eyes with poor visual acuity and/or visual potential.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Indications for TS-CPC or ECP:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Elevated IOP with poor vision and/or <bold>vi</bold>sual potential.</p></li>

<li><p class="">Poor candidates for glaucoma filtration surgery or glaucoma drainage devices.</p></li>

<li><p class="">Collection of donor eyes.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Process and storage of donor cornea.</p></li>

<li><p class="">To promote public education relation system.</p></li>
<li><p class="">To promote hospital cornea retrieval program (HCRP) to improve collection of donor eyes from hospital deaths.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch25lev2sec28"><h2 class="title">Collection</h2>
<p class="noindent">Person pledges before death to donate his eyes <span class="italic">(no living person can donate his one eye, because the law does not permit it. Similarly, eye tissue cannot be sold or purchased)</span>. After getting information of death, and proper written consent from the next of kin, eye bank personnel collects the eyes. The eyeballs should be collected with 4–6 hours of death (traditional postmortem time).</p>
<p class="indent">It is important to know the <span class="italic">age of the donor, time of death</span> and <span class="italic">cause of death</span> before enucleation of the donor globe or in-situ corneoscleral button excision. Most eye banks <a name="page495"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">495</span></span>accept eyes from donors between 6 months and 80 years of age.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch25lev2sec29"><h2 class="title">Methods</h2>
<p class="noindent">There are two methods of procuring donor tissue for the eye banks:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p class="">Voluntary donation (mostly without prior pledge).</p></li>
<li><p class="">Hospital cornea retrieval program (HCRP).</p></li>
</ol>
<div class="section" id="ch25lev3sec25"><h3 class="title">Voluntary Donation</h3>
<p class="noindent">It is the result of realization of one's social responsibility towards people with corneal blindness. However, in the moment of grief, this realization may not materialize to actual donation, because the near relatives may not be in a position to make such noble decisions. Currently, the total donor cornea collection all over India is between 60,000 to 70,000 per year. Maximum collections occur from Gujarat, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. Among these, 75–80% of eye donation is from voluntary aged donors who die in their homes, hospitals, or nursing homes. Only 40–45% of the eyes from voluntary donation are utilized for transplantation.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">The reasons are:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Age of the donor</p></li>
<li><p class="">Longer death-to-enucleation time</p></li>
<li><p class="">Nonavailability of donor's complete medical history.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">In order to address the nonavailability of <span class="italic">quality</span> corneal tissue, the Eye Bank Association of India (EBAI) along with Government of India has come up with this new cornea collection strategy called HCRP. This program was initiated by Ramayamma International Eye Bank at LVP Eye Institute, Hyderabad in 1990.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch25lev3sec26"><h3 class="title">Hospital Cornea Retrieval Program (HCRP)</h3>
<p class="noindent">Here, an <span class="italic">eye donation counselor</span> (EDC, or previously called <span class="italic">grief counselor)</span> makes a timely and sensitive request to the near relatives of the bereaved in a hospital set up to make an eye donation. With several leaflets and close intimate education, he or she wins the heart of the relatives deceased.</p>
<p class="indent">If the consent is given, he or she organizes quick collection of donor tissue (whole eyeball or in situ corneoscleral button) so that the family is not inconvenienced.</p>
<p class="indent">The overall conversion (request by EDC vs. actual donation) is between 5% and 35% in different hospitals. The donor cornea collection through HCRP is around 30% of total collection in last 2 years (i.e., approximately 20,000 cornea per year).</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Advantages of HCRP:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Access to younger and healthier tissues.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Availability of donor medical history.</p></li>
<li><p class="">To reduce death–to–enucleation time.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Higher cornea utilization rate (65% or more).</p></li>
<li><p class="">More scope of training and future research.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Cost-effective.</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="ch25lev4sec12"><h4 class="title">Choice of hospitals</h4>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Large multispeciality hospitals with 500 beds or more.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Death rate = 3–4 per day or greater than 10 per week.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Should be close vicinity (within 5–15 Km) to the linked eye bank.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Should have signed memorandum of understanding (MoU) between both.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Help and active support is required from all levels of the staff of the hospital.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">Pledged eyes cannot be retrieved without the consent of the family members (next of kin). The near relatives of those who have not pledged their eye can also decide, at the time of death, to donate the eyes of the deceased on his or her behalf. However, at the time of death of near and dear one, in the midst of grief and confusion, even the best of intention may not lead to actual eye donation. HCRP (with the help of trained counselor) plays a key role in this situation.<a name="page496"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">496</span></span></p>

<div class="section" id="ch25lev2sec43"><h2 class="title">Steps of Operation</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Universal eye speculum is applied.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Conjunctiva is dissected 360° around the limbus.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Whole cornea is removed with a No. 11 blade and scissors.</p></li>
<li><p class="">After fixing the sclera, the evisceration scoop is introduced between the sclera and the uveal tract and swept circumferentially 360° to separate the uveal tissues from the sclera and optic nerve.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Intraocular contents are scooped out thoroughly, precaution being taken to remove all the uveal tissues, especially around the vortex veins and optic nerve.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Bleeding is stopped by applying pressure with warm saline-soaked gauze.</p></li>

<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Frill excision:</span> If the entire sclera is left out, there is considerable reaction, and delayed wound healing. These disadvantages may be avoided, by cutting the insertion of the recti muscles and excising a greater part of the sclera, leaving only a small collar of sclera around the optic nerve, so as to leave the nerve sheath unopened.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Insertion of an acrylic ball implant:</span>
<ul style="list-style-type: square">
<li><p class="">A small acrylic or silicone ball (about 14–16 mm in diameter) (Mules’ sphere) is placed within the scleral cup (pocket) after proper hemostasis.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Sclera is sutured over the implant.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Tenon's capsule and the conjunctiva are sutured separately.</p></li>

<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Universal eye speculum is applied.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Conjunctiva is dissected all around the limbus, and Tenon's capsule is separated from the sclera up to the insertion of the extraocular muscles.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Each rectus muscle is hooked with a squint hook and cut with scissors, in the order of superior, lateral, inferior and medial rectus muscle (SLIM). For insertion of the implant, transfix each muscle with 5–0 chromic catgut suture.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Speculum is depressed, and the eyeball is made to be luxated out.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Enucleation scissors are introduced with closed-tip along the lateral side of the globe. Scissors are opened, and optic nerve is severed.</p></li>
</ul>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Oblique muscles are severed lastly with the same scissors.</p></li>

<li><p class="">Pressure bandage is applied for 48 hours.</p></li>
</ul>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="">In case of malignant intraocular tumor, it is essential to <span class="italic">cut the optic nerve at least 10 mm</span> behind the globe, near the optic foramen.</p>
<p class="indent">To do this, the eyeball is rotated laterally by a traction suture in the medial rectus tendon, and the optic nerve is tensioned. Enucleation spoon with optic nerve guide is introduced from the lateral side and optic nerve is then transected with one bold cut with a pair of <span class="italic">straight enucleation scissors</span> from the medial side of the globe.</p>

<p class="noindent">Implants are inserted within the Tenon's capsule, and the aim is:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">To provide a mobile base for the prosthesis to pivot upon.</p></li>
<li><p class="">To prevent bony deformity of the orbital wall (i.e., contracted socket) in children.</p></li>

<ul style="list-style-type: square">
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Non-integrated:</span> It is an acrylic sphere, which is inserted within the Tenon's capsule to maintain shape of the eyeball. The recti muscles are tied in a cruciate manner over the implant.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Semi-integrated:</span> It has holes or tunnels in which the four recti muscles are tied separately. It moves with the movement of the opposite eye.</p></li>
</ul></p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Semi-buried implants (integrated):</span> It is partially buried and partially expose implant. In its exposed part, the posterior surface of the prosthesis could be exactly fitted. Though it is capable of affording the best movement of the prosthesis, in the majority of the cases, there is infection and extrusion of the implants. It is not used nowadays.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Hydroxyapatite implant:</span> It is from natural source coral. It is a costly type of integrated implant in which an artificial eye is pegged. It gives the best cosmetic appearance with excellent movements of an artificial eye.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">A <span class="italic">prosthesis (or an artificial eye)</span> may be fitted in the 3rd or 4th week after the operation. The person who is responsible for making and fitting of an artificial eye, or prosthesis is called an <span class="italic">ocularist</span>.</p>
