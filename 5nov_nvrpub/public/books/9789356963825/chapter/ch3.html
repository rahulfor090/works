<p class="noindent">When light falls upon the retina, it acts as a stimulus to rods and cones, which serve as the visual nerve endings. As there are no rods and cones in the region of optic disc, it has no visual sensation and this is called the <span class="italic">blind spot (of Mariotte)</span>.</p>
<p class="indent">When light falls upon the retina, two essential reactions occur in the end-organs—<span class="italic">photochemical</span> and <span class="italic">electrical</span>.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch3lev2sec1"><h2 class="title">Photochemical Changes (<a href="#ch3fig1" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 3.1</a>)</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">The rods are the receptors for night (scotopic) vision and contain a pigment, visual purple or <span class="italic">rhodopsin</span>. The maximum absorption spectrum for <span class="italic">rhodopsin</span> is around 500 nm.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Rhodopsin consists of a colorless protein, called <span class="italic">opsin</span> and is coupled with a chromophore, <span class="italic">11-cis retinal</span> (aldehyde of vitamin A).</p></li>
<li><p class="">When light falls upon the rods, <span class="italic">11-cis retinal</span> component is converted into <span class="italic">all-trans retinal</span> through various stages.</p></li>
<li><p class="">This reaction is reversible in the dark, i.e., <span class="italic">11-cis retinal</span> is regenerated from all-trans retinal and vitamin A (retinol) from the blood.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">All-trans retinol</span> (an alcohol) is vitamin A and is transported in the blood to a specific retinal-binding protein.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent">The cones contain three different photopigments, with maximum absorption at 450, 535, and 570 nm, roughly corresponding to the blue, green, and red part of the visible spectrum. These pigments are called <span class="italic">iodopsin</span>. Cones not only respond to light of high intensities <span class="italic">(photopic vision)</span>, but also act as receptors for color vision.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch3lev2sec2"><h2 class="title">Electrical Changes</h2>
<p class="noindent">Visual transduction is the process by which light absorbed by the photoreceptors of the outer segment is converted into electrical energy. Though the process is complex, but a battery of <span class="italic">electrodiagnostic tests</span> are now in clinical uses for assessing the integrity of the retina and its central connections.</p>

<p class="noindent">Electroretinography (ERG) means a gross record of electrical potential changes in the retina after stimulation with light.</p>
<p class="indent">A recorder is made by placing an active electrode on the cornea (via a contact lens) and the other is on the forehead. The small voltage is amplified and usually photographed from the face of the oscilloscope.</p>

<div class="section" id="ch3lev2sec4"><h2 class="title">Responses</h2>
<p class="noindent">The ERG is a mass response of the outer layers of the retina. A normal ERG implies a healthy retinal and choroidal circulation, and normally functioning tissues between the RPE and the bipolar cells. The ganglion cell layer, nerve fiber layer, and the optic nerve play no part in this response.</p>

</div><div class="section" id="ch3lev1sec5"><h1 class="title">VISUAL PERCEPTIONS (SENSATIONS)</h1>
<p class="noindent">Visual sensations result from stimulation of the retina with light. These are four types—(1) light sense, (2) form sense, (3) sense of contrast, and (4) color sense.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch3lev2sec7"><h2 class="title">Light Sense</h2>
<p class="noindent">This is the faculty which permits us to perceive light in all its gradations of intensities.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Light minimum</span> is the minimum amount of light energy which, when falls upon the retina, causes a visual sensation. The light minimum for fovea is higher than parafoveal region. It is increased in diseases of rods and cones, e.g., retinitis pigmentosa.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Dark adaptation (<a href="#ch3fig5" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 3.5</a>):</span> The increase in sensitivity of the eye for detection of light that occurs in the dark is called <span class="italic">dark adaptation</span>.
<ul style="list-style-type: square">
<li><p class="">In the darkness, after the exposure of bright light, there is an initial increase in sensitivity following an exponential time course that reaches a plateau after 5–9 minutes. This initial phase is due to regeneration of photosensitive pigments in the cones.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Then as lower exponential time course that reaches a plateau in 30–45 minutes. This second phase is attributed to rhodopsin regeneration.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Dark adaptation is delayed by prolonged exposure to bright light.</p>

The luminance at −4 is that of city street lighting. The luminance at −3 is mean ground luminance in full moon.</div><img alt="Fig. 3.5" src="/MediumImage/35-2.jpg"><div class="additional-markup"></div></div></p></li>

</ul></p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Light adaptation:</span> It refers to the fall in the visual threshold on moving from darkness into a well lit room.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">This decrease in sensitivity is involving two changes—(1) a neural process that is completed in about 0.05 seconds and (2) a slower process, apparently involving the uncoupling of retinal and opsin in rhodopsin, occurring in about 1 minute.</p>
<div class="sidebar">
<p class="">The rods are much more sensitive to low illumination than the cones, so that in the dusk we see with our rods <span class="italic">(scotopic vision)</span>; in bright light the cones, come into play <span class="italic">(photopic vision)</span>. Nocturnal animals (e.g., bat) have few or no cones, and diurnal animals (like squirrel) have no rods.</p>
<p class=""><span class="italic">Mesopic vision:</span> It is a combination of photopic and scotopic vision in low-light situations. Most of the night-time outdoor activities and traffic lighting are in the mesopic vision range.</p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="ch3lev2sec8"><h2 class="title">Form Sense</h2>
<p class="noindent">This is the faculty which enables us to perceive the shape of the objects.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Cone is responsible for <span class="italic">form sense</span> which is most accurate the fovea, because here the cones are most closely set and highly differentiated.</p></li>
<li><p class="">It falls off very rapidly toward the periphery.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Visual acuity</span> is defined as the ability to distinguish the shape of the objects and it applies to central vision.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The form sense is not purely a retinal function for the perception of its composite form (e.g., letters)—is largely <span class="italic">psychological</span>.</p></li>
<li><p class="">In order to discriminate the form of an object, its several parts must be differentiated.</p>
<p class="">So, for two point's discrimination, it is necessary that two individual cones should be stimulated by them, while the one, in between two cones remains unstimulated.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="italic">Contrast sensitivity is reduced</span> in many ocular diseases, e.g., in glaucoma, macular disease or refractive errors, and sometimes, it is more important than the loss of visual acuity. It is especially important for screening the visual acuity in illiterates and young children.</p>
<p class="indent">Contrast sensitivity is also important in old age and after cataract surgery.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch3lev3sec1"><h3 class="title">Contrast Sensitivity</h3>
<p class="noindent">In its simplest terms, contrast sensitivity means the ability of the visual system to distinguish between an object and its background. It indirectly assesses the quality of vision.</p>
<p class="indent">Contrast sensitivity is the reciprocal value of the contrast threshold. A patient who needs a lot of contrast to see a target has low contrast sensitivity and <span class="italic">vice versa</span>.</p>
<p class="indent">Blur is not the same as poor contrast sensitivity. People who have poor vision than 6/6 on Snellen's letter chart will experience blurred vision. On the other hand, a person who has poor contrast sensitivity (e.g., due to cataract) may still test well on the 6/6 letters on chart and he may still experience cloudy vision.</p>
<p class="indent">Contrast sensitivity is expressed using sine-wave gratings <bold>(<a href="#ch3fig8" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 3.8</a>)</bold>. A sine-wave grating is a repetitive number of fuzzy dark and light bars, or cycle whose luminance profiles have the shape of simple mathematical function, sine. The number of cycles over a specified visual angle determines its spatial frequency.</p>
<p class="indent">Contrast sensitivity tests address the weakness of Snellen's high contrast acuity by varying two parameters—<span class="italic">grating size</span> and <span class="italic">contrast level</span>. It tests the functional vision, or how well individuals see everyday visual objects or scene (while driving or at work and play).</p>
<p class="indent">Contrast sensitivity changes with the age. As we get older, we lose contrast sensitivity, first at the higher spatial frequencies and then for all the spatial frequencies.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch3lev4sec1"><h4 class="title">Contrast Sensitivity Tests</h4>
<p class="noindent">Several test systems are available (both for distance and near)—the key difference is the target type:</p>

<div class="section" id="ch3lev2sec10"><h2 class="title">Color Sense</h2>
<p class="noindent">This is a faculty to distinguish between different colors as excited by light of different wavelengths. The appreciation of colors is a function of the cones and occurs only in photopic condition. In very low intensities of illumination, the dark-adapted eyes see no color and all objects are seen as gray, differing somewhat in brightness.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch3lev3sec2"><h3 class="title">Theories of Color Vision</h3>
<p class="noindent">This is a complicated process that involves physical, biological, and psychological mechanisms.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch3lev4sec2"><h4 class="title">Aristotle's Theory</h4>
<p class="noindent">Color vision derives from the intermingling of elements of light and darkness.</p>
<p class="indent">A more advanced eye of primates and human being can distinguish color which are just electromagnetic radiation of different wavelengths. We can see wavelengths in the range of 380–760 nm, the visible spectrum of light <bold>(<a href="#ch3fig10" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 3.10</a>)</bold>. We <span class="italic">cannot see</span> ultraviolet or infrared light.</p>
<p class="indent">We also do not perceive color in dim light (or in dark), because the light intensity is not enough to stimulate/bleach <span class="italic">iodopsin</span>. The threshold frequency of cones is high and requires more light for stimulation.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch3lev4sec3"><h4 class="title">Trichromatic Theory (of Young-Helmholtz) (<a href="#ch3fig11" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 3.11</a>)</h4>
<p class="noindent">Trichromatic color vision is mediated by interactions among three types of color sensing cones in the retina. Each of the three types of cone contains a different type of photosensitive pigment which is composed of transmembrane protein, called <span class="italic">opsin,</span> and a light sensitive molecule, called <span class="italic">11 cis-retinal</span>.</p>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="italic">three types of cone</span> are:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Long wavelength (L):</span> Peak sensitivity at 570 nm (red-sensitive cones or <span class="italic">erythrolabe)</span>.</p>

<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Medium wavelength (M):</span> Peak sensitivity at 535 nm (green-sensitive cones or <span class="italic">chlorolabe)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Short wavelength (S):</span> Peak sensitivity at 440 nm (blue-sensitive cones or <span class="italic">cyanolabe)</span>. The peak sensitivity of rods (R) is 498 nm. Each different pigment is especially sensitive to certain wavelength of light (photon) to produce a cellular response. This response of a given cone varies not only with the <span class="italic">wavelength of light</span> that hits it, but also with its <span class="italic">intensity</span>. The brain would not be able to discriminate different colors if it had input from <span class="italic">only</span> one type of cone. Thus interaction between two types of cones is necessary to produce ability to perceive color and trichromatic color vision is accomplished by using combination of cell responses.</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="indent">But trichromatic theory does not explain why red matched with green appears yellow, or why blue added to yellow appears white.</p>
<p class="indent">It also does not explain the phenomenon of complementary after images (if the eye is adapted to a yellow stimulus, the removal of stimulus leaves a blue sensation or after-image).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch3lev4sec4"><h4 class="title">Opponent-process Theory (of Herring) (<a href="#ch3fig12" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 3.12</a>)</h4>
<p class="noindent">Opponent color theory states that the human visual system interprets information about color by processing signals from cones in an antagonist manner. The L, M, and S cones have some overlap in the wavelengths of light. So the visual system is more efficient to record differences between the responses of cones, rather than individual cone's response.</p>
<p class="indent">The opponent theory suggests that there are <span class="italic">three opponent channels</span>—red versus green, blue versus yellow, and white versus black. The last one is achromatic and detects dark-light variations, i.e., <span class="italic">luminance</span>. The responses to one color of an opponent channel are antagonistic to those of other color.</p>
<p class="indent">Although, <span class="italic">trichromatic</span> theory allows the visual system to <span class="italic">detect color</span> with L, M, and S cones (at the photoreceptor level); the <span class="italic">opponent theory</span> <bold>(<a href="#ch3fig12" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 3.12</a>)</bold> accounts for mechanisms that <span class="italic">receive and process</span> information from cones (inter-neurally). It is now accepted that <span class="italic">both the theories are important</span> to understand the mechanism of color vision <bold>(<a href="#ch3fig12" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 3.12</a>)</bold>.</p>
<p class="indent">The recently proposed explanation seems to be more complex:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">L, M, and S cones respond best to long, medium, and short wavelength of light, respectively.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Information from cones is passed to the bipolar cells which may be cells in opponent process.</p></li>
<li><p class="">This information is then passed to <span class="italic">two types</span> of ganglion cells—magnocellular (large cells) and parvocellular (small cells).</p>
<p class=""><span class="italic">Parvocellular cells (P cells)</span> are the major cells <span class="italic">which handle information about color</span>. Two groups:</p>

<p class="noindent">Color blinds have defective color discrimination. It is of two type—(1) congenital and (2) acquired.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Congenital:</span> Most common, and inherited as an X-linked recessive anomaly. Male 7% and female only 0.7%, have congenitally defective color vision.</p>
<p class="">Visual acuity is normal and ophthalmo-scopically the fundi appear normal. The defect is present at birth and stationary.</p>
<p class="">A <span class="italic">protanope</span> has <span class="italic">(protan</span> means first) the red sensation missing, a <span class="italic">deuteranope</span> <span class="italic">(deutan</span> means second) has the green, and <span class="italic">a tritanope</span> <span class="italic">(tritan</span> means third) has the blue sensation missing.</p>
<p class="">Red-green blindness is more common in congenital type.</p>
<p class="">The term <span class="italic">achromatopsia</span> means the individual borns with severely deficient color perception, where there is absence of all three cones, and thus visual acuity is also very much reduced, and nystagmus is present.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Acquired color blindness:</span> Occurs as a result of diseases of the cones, macular diseases, lental sclerosis, optic nerve disease, and drug-induced (e.g., ethambutol).</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Importance:</span> Social importance of color blindness is important particularly for drivers, pilots, chemists, biochemists, and also in higher education.</p>

<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Pseudoisochromatic (Ishihara's) test (<a href="#ch3fig13" class="ulink-inter">Figs. 3.13A to F</a>)</span> is used for routine screening in most ophthalmologist's office. Here, a series of 21 color plates containing panels that are filled by colored dots in which bold numerical or different lines (for illiterates) are represented in dots of various tinted sets. This gives a fair assessment, especially for red-green (R-G) blindness.</p></li>
