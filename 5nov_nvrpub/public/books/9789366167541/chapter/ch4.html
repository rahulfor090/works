</div><p class="noindent">As mentioned in the second chapter, muscle nerve stimulating currents are used primarily for muscle re-education, pain relief, to delay atrophy and wasting of muscles. This chapter includes direct current, Faradic current, interrupted direct current, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), interferential current, sinusoidal current, diadynamic current, high-voltage pulsed Galvanic current (HVPG) and micro amperage electrical nerve stimulation.</p><div class="section" id="ch4lev1sec1"><h1 class="title">DIRECT CURRENT</h1>
<p class="noindent">Direct current (DC) electrotherapy is a form of electrical stimulation therapy used in physiotherapy to deliver continuous unidirectional electrical current. Direct current is a unidirectional as well as continuous current. This current is mostly useful for various therapeutic purposes, including pain relief, tissue healing, and iontophoresis. It is also termed as Galvanic current or plain Galvanic current, as an honor to Luigi Galvani, professor of anatomy who stimulated muscles and nerves of a frog with direct current, in 1786. It is also called <span class="italic">constant current</span>, as the current passes continuously in the same direction. A schematic representation of direct current is given in <bold><a href="#ch4fig1" class="ulink-inter">Figure 4.1</a></bold>.</p>
<p class="indent">The key characteristics of direct current include a continuous steady flow of current in one direction, distinct effects at the cathode and anode, influencing tissue healing and ion movement and electrochemical reactions that can cause chemical changes under the electrodes, making electrode care and placement crucial. Direct current is mainly used for iontophoresis, anodal galvanism, cathodal galvanism, and for acceleration of healing.<a name="page66"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">66</span></span></p>

<div class="section" id="ch4lev2sec1"><h2 class="title">Production</h2>
<p class="noindent">Direct current can be obtained from dry batteries as well as from household alternating current. Direct current can be obtained from dry batteries by connecting the cells in series. This setup ensures a steady and continuous flow of DC. A variable resistance is incorporated into the circuit to control the output current and voltage. Additionally, instruments like a voltmeter or ammeter can be included to measure the intensity of the output. An alternative source of direct current is household alternating current (AC). To achieve this, the AC voltage is first reduced using a step-down transformer. This lowers the voltage to a safer and manageable level for further processing. Once the AC voltage is reduced, it undergoes rectification, a process that converts AC into DC. The rectified current is then smoothened to remove any residual fluctuations, ensuring a stable direct current output. The final DC output is controlled using variable resistance, allowing precise adjustments to the current or voltage as needed. A voltmeter is commonly used to measure and monitor the output, ensuring it meets the required specifications.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch4lev2sec2"><h2 class="title">Polarity</h2>
<p class="noindent">Polarity is generally marked with direct current source by color codes, for example, red for positive and black for negative. It may be tested with two simple experiments such as, saltwater experiment and phenolphthalein experiment. The saltwater experiment is shown in <bold><a href="#ch4fig2" class="ulink-inter">Figure 4.2</a></bold>.<a name="page67"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">67</span></span></p>
<div class="figure" id="ch4fig2" data-label="Fig. 4.2"><div class="title"><span class="item-label">Fig. 4.2</span> Saltwater experiment.</div><img alt="Fig. 4.2" src="/MediumImage/67-1.jpg"><div class="additional-markup"></div></div>
<p class="noindent">In saltwater experiment, little salt is added to water in a glass container, then electrodes attached to direct current terminals are inserted. After this, when the intensity is increased, you can see many more bubbles getting evolved at negative electrode or cathode and few bubbles at anode. It is because, water is split into hydrogen and oxygen ions. Hydrogen being positive ion, gets liberated at cathode and oxygen gets liberated at anode. Considering the water molecule, it is obvious that the number of hydrogen atoms will be double than oxygen and hence, many more bubbles at cathode are evolved as compared to anode. In case of phenolphthalein experiment, add a few drops of phenolphthalein over tissue paper and place the electrodes connected to the direct current source over it, then pass the current for some time and you will see pink color under negative electrode or cathode.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch4lev2sec3"><h2 class="title">Physiological Effects</h2>
<p class="noindent">The various physiological effects of direct current are stimulation of sensory nerves, stimulation of motor nerves, accommodation and chemical production.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch4lev3sec1"><h3 class="title">Stimulation of Sensory Nerves</h3>
<p class="noindent">When direct current is applied to the body tissue, it stimulates sensory nerves and produces burning sensation. This sensory irritation is felt under both the electrodes, but if the current flows for sufficient length of time, then more irritation is felt under the negative electrode. Hence, the intensity of current during the treatment is adjusted in such a way that it avoids overstimulation or unpleasant sensation.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch4lev3sec2"><h3 class="title">Stimulation of Motor Nerves</h3>
<p class="noindent">Direct current can produce stimulation of motor nerves during its “on” and “off”. Immediately after direct current is switched on, accommodation in motor nerves takes place and hence there is no further response.<a name="page68"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">68</span></span> Direct current is almost ineffective for motor nerve stimulation due to continuous flow since direct current provides a steady, nonpulsed current, which causes polarization of the nerve membrane. Continuous polarization prevents the repeated depolarization necessary to generate a train of action potentials required for motor nerve stimulation. Accommodation or adaptation occurs since motor nerves quickly adapt to a constant stimulus, reducing their response to direct current and there is a polarity effect. The cathode (negative electrode) is more effective in lowering the membrane potential (depolarization). Still, the steady nature of direct current does not provide the required periodic changes for motor nerve activation.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch4lev3sec3"><h3 class="title">Accommodation</h3>
<p class="noindent">Accommodation is physiological adaptation by nerves. Motor nerves get quickly accommodated to direct current and hence it is not possible to stimulate the innervated as well as denervated muscles by direct current. Analogy of accommodation can be done with our feeling of clothes on the body. We feel that we have put on the clothes after bath, but afterwards we get adapted and do not get the same feel throughout the day. Similarly, if one's house is by the main road, then he gets used to the night traffic and can have sound sleep as a result of adaptation. Accommodation due to direct current (DC) is a phenomenon where nerves, especially motor and sensory nerves, adapt to a constant stimulus and stop responding despite the continued application of the stimulus. This is a critical concept in electrotherapy and impacts the clinical applications of DC. Mechanism of accommodation includes constant stimulus, gradual polarization, threshold increase and ionic redistribution. Direct current provides a steady, unidirectional flow of electrons, causing a continuous and unchanging stimulus at the nerve membrane. Under the cathode, the nerve membrane depolarizes, while under the anode, it hyperpolarizes. Initially, the depolarization may reach the threshold, causing an action potential. However, with continuous stimulation, the nerve membrane adapts to the steady-state polarization. During accommodation, the nerve becomes less responsive as the threshold for action potential generation rises. This occurs due to the inactivation of sodium ion channels and stabilization of the nerve membrane potential and continuous ionic movement caused by DC alters the local ionic balance, reducing the excitability of the nerve over time. Consequences of accommodation includes reduced effective stimulation, inefficiency in exciting motor or sensory nerves and higher current requirement.<a name="page69"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">69</span></span> Nerve fibers no longer respond to the same level of current intensity after initial stimulation. Accommodation limits the use of DC for repetitive nerve excitation. To overcome accommodation, a gradual increase in current intensity (ramp-up technique) or the use of interrupted or pulsed currents is needed. Factors Influencing accommodation includes nerve fiber type, intensity and duration and polarity effects. Sensory nerves (e.g., A-beta fibers) accommodate more rapidly than motor nerves. Denervated muscles and non-nervous tissues like muscle fibers respond to DC because they do not accommodate in the same way. Higher intensity and longer duration of DC increase the rate of accommodation. Accommodation occurs faster under the anode due to hyperpolarization compared to the cathode.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch4lev3sec4"><h3 class="title">Chemical Production</h3>
<p class="noindent">When direct current is applied to the body tissue it produces chemicals in the form of acid and base. Base or alkali is produced at the cathode and acid at the anode (remember A for acid and A for anode). The application of direct current (DC) to the human body, particularly in electrotherapy, leads to chemical reactions under the electrodes due to the movement of ions. This phenomenon, often referred to as electrolysis, results in specific chemical production near the cathode (negative electrode) and the anode (positive electrode). These reactions are essential for understanding the therapeutic effects and precautions of DC application. The cathode attracts positive ions (cations) such as sodium (Na<sup>+</sup>) and hydrogen (H<sup>+</sup>) and reduction reaction occurs at the cathode and hence water dissociates into hydroxide ions (OH<sup>−</sup>) and hydrogen gas. Alkaline reaction due to the accumulation of hydroxide ions (OH<sup>−</sup>) and the pH under the cathode increases, which can soften tissues and enhance excitability of the nerves and muscles. At the anode (+) (positive electrode) the anode attracts negative ions (anions) such as chloride (Cl<sup>−</sup>) and hydroxide (OH<sup>−</sup>). Oxidation reactions occur at the anode. The pH under the anode decreases, which can harden tissues and decrease nerve excitability.</p>
<p class="indent">In other words, the chemical effects of DC application in the human body are primarily due to the electrolysis of water and the movement of ions under the electrodes. These reactions result in alkaline and acidic environments at the cathode and anode, respectively, with significant therapeutic applications but also risks such as chemical burns. Proper techniques and precautions ensure safe and effective use of DC in physiotherapy.<a name="page70"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">70</span></span></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch4lev3sec5"><h3 class="title">Effect on Body Proteins</h3>
<p class="noindent">It is believed that the direct current causes coagulation of proteins under the positive electrode and liquefaction under the negative electrode. The application of direct current (DC) to the human body can have notable effects on proteins, primarily due to the movement of ions and changes in the pH environment near the electrodes. These effects are clinically significant in certain therapies, but they can also pose risks if not managed appropriately. The effects include protein denaturation, protein precipitation, electrophoretic movement, effect on enzyme activity, and impact on collagen and elastin.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Under the cathode:</span> The increase in alkalinity (due to hydroxide ion accumulation) can cause local protein denaturation. Alkaline conditions can break hydrogen bonds and alter the tertiary and quaternary structures of proteins, affecting their function.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Under the anode:</span> The acidic environment (due to hydrogen ion accumulation) can also denature proteins. Acidic conditions can disrupt ionic bonds and promote the aggregation of proteins, leading to coagulation. At the anode, the acidic environment may lead to the precipitation of certain proteins, which can be observed in wound care applications where DC is used.</p>
<p class="indent">Proteins, being charged molecules, can migrate under the influence of DC: Positively charged proteins move toward the cathode. Negatively charged proteins move toward the anode. This movement can influence cellular processes and tissue healing. Enzymes, which are proteins, can have their activity altered by the pH changes induced by DC. Alkaline or acidic conditions may inhibit enzyme function or denature the enzymes, disrupting metabolic processes in the immediate area. Collagen, a structural protein in connective tissue, may be softened under the cathode due to increased alkalinity, which can aid in scar tissue remodeling. At the anode, the acidic environment can harden collagen fibers, potentially useful in certain therapeutic contexts. Clinical implications includes wound healing since DC can promote tissue repair by influencing protein dynamics: Alkaline conditions under the cathode can help dissolve necrotic proteins. Acidic conditions under the anode may reduce bacterial protein activity, promoting a sterile environment.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Electrolysis and protein effects:</span> The chemical changes induced by DC can impact cellular proteins and extracellular matrix components, facilitating tissue regeneration.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Iontophoresis:</span> DC can aid in the delivery of protein-based drugs or biologics by facilitating their transdermal migration. Risks and precautions include protein damage, burns, and tissue necrosis since prolonged DC application or high intensities can denature proteins excessively, leading to tissue damage. Burns and tissue necrosis since protein denaturation under the cathode or anode contributes to the risk of chemical burns if DC is improperly applied.<a name="page71"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">71</span></span></p>

<div class="section" id="ch4lev2sec4"><h2 class="title">Therapeutic Indications</h2>
<p class="noindent">Therapeutically direct current is used for medical galvanism, anodal galvanism, cathodal galvanism, surgical galvanism and iontophoresis.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch4lev3sec6"><h3 class="title">Galvanism</h3>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">The use of direct current without any drug for the treatment of various diseases and disorders is known as galvanism</span>. <bold>Therapeutic galvanism</bold> refers to the application of direct current (DC) for therapeutic purposes in physiotherapy. This technique utilizes a steady, unidirectional electric current to achieve physiological and therapeutic effects. It is commonly employed in electrotherapy for pain management and tissue repair. Therapeutic effects of galvanism include tissue healing, stimulation of physiological repair mechanism, improve blood circulation, reduces pain. Dosages can be adjusted with current intensity (mA) based on patient tolerance and desired effect.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch4lev3sec7"><h3 class="title">Medical Galvanism</h3>
<p class="noindent">Here both the electrodes are of the same size <bold>(<a href="#ch4fig3" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 4.3</a>)</bold>. It causes vasomotor stimulation of the skin and increased circulation to the body part where direct current is applied. This method leverages the electrochemical and physiological effects of DC for a variety of applications in medicine and physiotherapy. Unlike alternating current (AC), DC flows steadily in one direction, allowing for precise control over therapeutic effects. Basic principles of medical galvanism include sedative action, softening, and tissue relaxation. Medical galvanism is used for acute and chronic inflammatory conditions such as chilblain, Raynaud's disease, and Buerger's disease, for pain relief, tissue healing, scar tissue softening, and promoting healing of wounds, pressure sores, and diabetic ulcers.</p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="ch4lev3sec8"><h3 class="title">Anodal Galvanism</h3>
<p class="noindent">Here anode is an active electrode and cathode, which is larger, acts as an indifferent electrode <bold>(<a href="#ch4fig4" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 4.4</a>)</bold>. Anodal galvanism produces acidic reaction, hardens the tissue and reduces nerve irritability (<bold>Mnemonic:</bold> ‘HARN’ where H: harden, A: acidic reaction and RN: reduce nerve irritability). Anodal galvanism is used for pain relief. <span class="italic">Anodal Galvanism refers to the therapeutic use of direct current with the anode (positive pole) as the active electrode.</span> This application has the unique physiological and electrochemical effects of the positively charged electrode for targeted therapeutic outcomes. The anode attracts negatively charged ions, produces an acidic environment (formation of hydrochloric acid in tissues), and causes protein coagulation at the site of application. Biological effects produced by anodal galvanism are sedative effect through reduced nerve excitability, vasoconstrictive effects through reduced local blood flow and inflammation. Therapeutic indications or uses are pain relief in conditions like neuralgia, radiculopathy, and tendonitis, wound healing particularly in chronic wounds, ulcers, and burns, hyperhidrosis since it can reduce excessive sweating by altering sweat gland activity and in softening scars by modulating tissue remodeling.</p>
<div class="figure" id="ch4fig4" data-label="Fig. 4.4"><div class="title"><span class="item-label">Fig. 4.4</span> Anodal galvanism.</div><img alt="Fig. 4.4" src="/MediumImage/72-1.jpg"><div class="additional-markup"></div></div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch4lev3sec9"><h3 class="title">Cathodal Galvanism</h3>
<p class="noindent">Here cathode is an active electrode, and anode is an indifferent electrode <bold>(<a href="#ch4fig5" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 4.5</a>)</bold>. It produces basic reaction or alkaline reaction, softens the tissues and increases nerve irritability. It is used to soften scar tissue. <span class="italic">Cathodal Galvanism refers to the therapeutic use of direct current (DC) with the cathode (negative pole) as the active electrode</span>. The cathode exerts unique electrochemical and physiological effects, making it suitable for specific therapeutic goals, such as enhancing tissue healing.<a name="page73"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">73</span></span></p>
<div class="figure" id="ch4fig5" data-label="Fig. 4.5"><div class="title"><span class="item-label">Fig. 4.5</span> Cathodal galvanism.</div><img alt="Fig. 4.5" src="/MediumImage/73-1.jpg"><div class="additional-markup"></div></div>
<p class="noindent">The cathode attracts positively charged ions, produces an alkaline reaction (formation of sodium hydroxide in tissues) and softens tissues and enhances hydration at the site of application. It increases nerve and muscle excitability, enhances local blood flow, promoting tissue oxygenation and nutrient delivery. It accelerates healing by enhancing circulation and promoting cellular repair, reduces chronic pain by influencing nerve function and aids in resolving localized swelling through improved lymphatic and venous return.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch4lev3sec10"><h3 class="title">Surgical Galvanism or Electrolysis</h3>
<p class="noindent">Surgical galvanism or electrolysis is destruction of superfluous hair (hypertrichosis) by the use of galvanic current. Here cathode, which acts as an active electrode is in the form of needle and anode, is an indifferent electrode. Half milliampere of direct current is applied for 1 minute. Bubbles will come out and then hair can be lifted easily with forceps. Aseptic precautions should be taken during this procedure. Skill is required for surgical galvanism. There are 10 to 20% chances of recurrence following this technique. Surgical galvanism is a specialized application of direct current (DC) in medical and surgical procedures. It leverages the electrochemical effects of galvanic current for tissue destruction, coagulation, or other therapeutic purposes. This technique is largely historical but has modern analogs in electrochemical and surgical technologies. Direct current induces localized chemical changes, such as the formation of acidic and alkaline environments at the electrodes. These changes can cause tissue coagulation, destruction, or dissolution. The current creates precise, controlled tissue necrosis without significant damage to surrounding areas. Applications includes electrolysis used to destroy unwanted tissues or lesions, such as tumors, warts, or hair follicles (for permanent hair removal), cauterization that helps to coagulates tissues to stop bleeding during surgeries, previously it was also used for destruction of pathological growths used to treat conditions like granulomas, polyps, or certain benign tumors, treatment of infections since it is applied to drain or disinfect infected areas, leveraging its antiseptic properties and historically it was also used in oncology to destroy small malignant tumors by electrochemical decomposition.<a name="page74"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">74</span></span></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch4lev3sec11"><h3 class="title">Iontophoresis</h3>
<p class="noindent">It is also known as <span class="italic">ion transfer, ionization, or cataphoric medication</span> (<bold>Mnemonic</bold>: ‘ICI’). It is believed that Stéphane Leduc discovered it in 1903. Iontophoresis is the specific transfer of ions into the body tissue by using direct current for therapeutic purposes. (You can recall this definition by asking yourself questions, such as, what is transferred? where is it transferred? how is it transferred? and what for it is transferred?) Transdermal administration of drug is assuming an important place in modern drug therapy. It is used for nonionized drugs required in a small dosage. Transdermal administration can be passive or facilitated. In passive administration, the nonionized drug traverses the skin through the stratum corneum. The skin, being a semi-permeable membrane, allows only a small amount of any drug molecule to passively penetrate the skin. Ionized drugs do not easily penetrate this barrier and are not suitable for routine trans-dermal delivery unless an external source of energy is provided to drive the drug across the skin. Facilitated diffusion can utilize either ultrasound (phonophoresis) or electrical (iontophoresis) energy. In iontophoresis, this external source of energy is in the form of an applied direct electrical current.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch4lev4sec1"><h4 class="title">Principle</h4>
<p class="noindent">It is based on the principle that an electrically charged electrode will repel a similarly charged ion. In other words, if a drug is in ionic form, then it can be made to travel through the body tissue through the skin by the use of direct current via repulsive force between similar charges. We can understand this theory or principle with Leduc experiment, as shown in <bold><a href="#ch4fig6" class="ulink-inter">Figure 4.6</a></bold>.</p>
<p class="indent">Two rabbits are arranged in a series. Over positive electrode of rabbit A, strychnine is applied. Over negative electrode of rabbit B, potassium cyanide is applied. Other electrodes are moistened to allow the passage of current. Pass direct current through this series. Rabbit B will die, and rabbit A will have convulsions. Place new rabbits and reverse the polarity, there will be no effect. This suggests that there is a transfer of ions when placed over similarly charged electrodes.<a name="page75"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">75</span></span></p>
<div class="figure" id="ch4fig6" data-label="Fig. 4.6"><div class="title"><span class="item-label">Fig. 4.6</span> Leduc experiment.</div><img alt="Fig. 4.6" src="/MediumImage/75-1.jpg"><div class="additional-markup"></div></div>
<p class="indent">Iontophoresis enhances transdermal drug delivery by three mechanisms:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p class="">Ion-electric field interaction provides an additional force that drives ions through the skin.</p></li>
<li><p class="">The flow of electric current increases the permeability of the skin, and</p></li>
<li><p class="">Electro-osmosis produces bulk motion of solvent that carries ions or neutral species with the solvent stream.</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="indent">Electro-osmotic flow occurs in a variety of membranes and is in the same direction as the flow of counter-ions. It may assist or hinder drug transport. Since human skin is negatively charged above pH 4, counter ions are positive ions, and electro-osmotic flow occurs from anode to cathode. Thus, anodic delivery is assisted by electro-osmosis, but cathodic delivery is retarded. Because of the electro-osmotic flow, transdermal delivery of a large anion (negatively charged protein) from the anode compartment is more effective than that from the cathode compartment. Iontophoretic devices may be powered by electricity, batteries or by rechargeable power sources. An iontophoresis device consists of a microprocessor-controlled battery powered DC current, drug reservoir, and electrodes. The battery is most commonly 9-volt one. The drug reservoir consists of a gauze/cloth or gel pad to which the solution is applied, or the solution is injected through a port into the reservoir electrode combination. Wires are connected between the microprocessor unit and the active and passive electrodes. Iontophoretic drug delivery electrodes are available and are composed of hydrogel material that is hydrated before use to deliver local anesthesia.<a name="page76"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">76</span></span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="italic">Reverse iontophoresis</span> is the application of an electric current across the skin that is used to extract a substance of interest from within or beneath the skin to the surface for testing. In vivo and in vitro methods have shown that the approach can be used to monitor the subdermal concentration variation of glucose and provide a non-invasive technique by which a diabetic can monitor the fluctuation of blood sugar.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch4lev4sec2"><h4 class="title">Advantages of iontophoresis</h4>
<p class="noindent">Iontophoresis provides for controlled delivery rates (through variations of current density, pulsed voltage, drug concentration and ionic strength). It eliminates gastrointestinal incompatibility, erratic absorption, and first pass metabolism. It reduces side effects and avoids the risks of infection, inflammation, and fibrosis associated with continuous injection or infusion since it is noninvasive. It enhances patient compliance with a convenient and noninvasive therapeutic regimen, and decreased dosing frequency. It improves efficacy by continuous release and decreases the total dose and dosing frequency.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch4lev4sec3"><h4 class="title">Disadvantages of iontophoresis</h4>
<p class="noindent">There is a possibility of burns if the electrodes are improperly used. The formation of undesirable vesicles and bullae in skin being treated can be avoided by periodically interrupting a unidirectional treatment current with a relatively short pulse of current in the opposite direction.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch4lev4sec4"><h4 class="title">Effectiveness</h4>
<p class="noindent">The effectiveness of iontophoresis depends on a number of ions transferred and the depth of penetration. The number of ions transferred is determined by current density, duration of current flow, and concentration of ions, the physicochemical properties of the drug, formulation factors, biological factors and electro-endo-osmotic flow. Iontophoresis is facilitated by increased vasodilation to the area under electrodes and inhibited by the insoluble nature of ions. Physicochemical variables that include the charge, size, structure and lipophilicity of the drug. The drug should be water soluble, low-dose and ionizable with a high charge density. Smaller molecules are more mobile but large molecules are also iontophoresable.</p>
<p class="indent">Formulation factors include the drug concentration, pH, ionic strength, and viscosity.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Drug concentration:</bold> Increasing drug concentrations results in greater drug delivery to a certain degree.<a name="page77"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">77</span></span></p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Ionic strength:</bold> If buffer ions are included, they compete with the drug for the delivery, decreasing the quantity of drug delivered, especially since buffer ions are generally smaller and more mobile than the larger active drug.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>pH:</bold> The pH of the solution can be adjusted and maintained by larger molecules, such as ethanolamine: Ethanolamine hydrochloride rather than the smaller hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide. An increase in ionic strength of the system will also increase the competition for the available current, especially since the active drugs are generally potent and present in a smaller concentration than these extraneous ions.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Viscosity:</bold> The migration of the drug is inversely related to viscosity.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">Biological factors involve the skin to which the electrodes are applied, its thickness, permeability, presence of pores, etc. Sweat glands are the most significant path for the conduction of charges into the skin. This was demonstrated by Papa and Kligman, when methylene blue introduced into the skin via iontophoresis entered sweat glands in a punctuate pattern and outlined the sweat pores.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Electro-endo-osmosis transport:</span> Drugs can also be transported via electro-endo-osmosis. When a current is applied, there is also a flow of water from the electrode reservoir into the skin. Any drug in solution, ionized or nonionized, can follow the water flow into the skin. In this manner, some drugs that are not ionized can also be given iontophoretically. If only the nonionized drug is to be given, it may be necessary to add a small quantity of sodium chloride to the solution for conductivity and to establish electro-endo-osmotic flow.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch4lev4sec5"><h4 class="title">Method of application</h4>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Assessment:</bold> When you have decided to go for iontophoresis then inquire about allergy to any drug, inspect the area of the body where iontophoresis is to be done and check the sensation.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Selection of ion:</bold> Select the chemical solution containing the desired ions with adequate concentration. For example, if you want an analgesic effect then select salicylic acid as a solution since it contains salicylate ions which have analgesic properties.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Explain the procedure:</bold> Explain the procedure to your patient so that he is aware of what you are going to do and cooperates with you.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Position:</bold> Position your patient in such a way that he is comfortable during the treatment. I prefer mostly supine.<a name="page78"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">78</span></span></p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Clean the area to be treated:</bold> Clean the area of body to be treated with spirit or normal saline and cotton swab. It reduces skin resistance and removes the dust particles from the area and thus facilitates iontophoresis.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Preparation of electrodes and placement:</bold> Moisten or soak the piece of bath towel/lint cloth in the drug solution and place it over an active electrode and now place the active electrode over the body part to be treated or massage the solution into the skin and place the active electrode over it. Place the larger indifferent electrode at least 18 inches away from the active electrode. Secure the electrodes in position with Velcro straps.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Application of treatment:</bold> Connect the electrodes to desired terminals. Increase the intensity until prickling, tingling or burning sensation is produced or 0.1 to 0.5 mA/cm<sup>2</sup> of electrode. Continue the treatment for 15 minutes and check the undersurface of electrodes after every 5 minutes so as to prevent electrochemical burn.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Termination of the treatment:</bold> After 15 minutes, reduce intensity gradually and remove the electrodes.</p></li>

<p class="noindent">Iontophoresis is commonly used for arthritic and myalgia pain, softening of the scar tissues and adhesions, gouty and calcium deposits, bursitis and tendonitis, hyperhidrosis, wounds and ulcer healing and allergic rhinitis. For relief of pain and muscle spasm in cases of myalgia, arthritis and sprain, sodium salicylic acid can be used. In order to soften scar tissue and adhesions, a solution of sodium chloride can be used. Gouty deposits or calcium deposits can be treated with acetic acid iontophoresis. Inflammatory conditions such as bursitis, tendonitis, etc., can be treated with hydrocortisone iontophoresis. Hyperhidrosis, which is characterized by excessive sweating, can be treated with hyaluronidase iontophoresis. For the acceleration of wound and ulcer healing, iontophoresis can be done with an adequate concentration (preferably 5%) of zinc sulfate. Also, zinc sulfate can be used to reduce infections such as Athlete's foot, tinea pedis and in the treatment of allergic rhinitis. Histamine iontophoresis is used to increase blood supply.

<p class="noindent">Various contraindications for iontophoresis are hypersensitivity, impaired sensation and pregnancy. (<bold>Mnemonic: ‘HIP’</bold> where H: hypersensitivity, I: impaired sensation, P: pregnancy).</p>
<p class="indent">Dangers of iontophoresis are chemical burns, alarming shock, electric shock and headache. Chemical burn or tissue destruction is likely to occur if the current density is high, metal electrode touches the skin directly because of insufficient padding. Shock may occur if patient touches the live part of the circuit, from which direct current is produced or if the insulation of the main cable is defective. Alarming shock is likely to occur if circuit is broken suddenly. It may occur if electrodes are not moistened enough or when wrinkles are present or when air gaps are present between electrodes and body tissue. Blood pressure changes/headache may occur in case of histamine iontophoresis.<a name="page80"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">80</span></span></p>

</div><div class="section" id="ch4lev1sec2"><h1 class="title">FARADIC CURRENT</h1>
<p class="noindent">Let us understand original Faradic and Faradic type of currents to have a comprehensive idea about Faradic current.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch4lev2sec5"><h2 class="title">Original Faradic Current</h2>
<p class="noindent">The original Faradic current refers to a type of low frequency alternating electrical current used in physiotherapy and electrotherapy for muscle stimulation. It was first introduced by Michael Faraday, hence the name. This current is characterized by its ability to stimulate motor nerves, leading to muscle contraction, which is particularly useful in therapeutic settings for conditions involving muscle weakness or paralysis. The original Faradic current was extensively used in the past. It is a type of current, which can be produced by a Faradic coil. Please refer the <bold><a href="#ch4fig7" class="ulink-inter">Figure 4.7</a></bold> and note that it is an alternating current. It consists of two unequal phases; the first phase is of low intensity and long duration and second phase is of high intensity and short duration. Here, the second phase is effective, and its duration is 1 millisecond. Frequency of the original Faradic current is 50 cycles per second.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch4lev2sec6"><h2 class="title">Faradic Type Current</h2>
<p class="noindent">The Faradic type of current is also called a modern type of current. It is a short duration, interrupted direct current with a pulse duration of 0.1 to 1 m/sec and a frequency of 50 to 100 Hz <bold>(<a href="#ch4fig8" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 4.8</a>)</bold>. It is obtained from an electronic stimulator. It has a similar physiological effect as that of the original Faradic current. Faradic current is a type of low frequency, interrupted, alternating electrical current commonly used in physiotherapy for stimulating muscles and nerves. It was derived from the principles of electromagnetic induction discovered by Michael Faraday. This current is primarily used to produce muscle contractions in cases where motor nerve function is intact.</p>
<div class="figure" id="ch4fig7" data-label="Fig. 4.7"><div class="title"><span class="item-label">Fig. 4.7</span> Original Faradic current.</div><img alt="Fig. 4.7" src="/MediumImage/80-1.jpg"><div class="additional-markup"></div></div>

<div class="figure" id="ch4fig8" data-label="Fig. 4.8"><div class="title"><span class="item-label">Fig. 4.8</span> Faradic type current.</div><img alt="Fig. 4.8" src="/MediumImage/81-1.jpg"><div class="additional-markup"></div></div>
<div class="section" id="ch4lev3sec12"><h3 class="title">Production</h3>
<p class="noindent">It is produced on the same principle as that of interrupted direct current. But values of condenser and resistance are low so as to get short duration of impulses and high frequency. An electric pulse generator that produces Faradic current has four functional parts in form of a power supply, oscillator circuit, modulating circuit, and amplifying circuit. The power supply may be from a battery or alternating current. Typically, household alternating current of 220 to 250 volts is used with a step-down transformer that reduces the voltage from the power source to a suitable level for generating Faradic pulses. The oscillator circuit or pulse generator circuit provides short-duration pulses of 0.1 to 1 ms with a frequency of 50 to 100 Hz. The interruption creates the characteristic rhythmic on-and-off nature of Faradic current. Modulating circuit gives surged output and amplifying circuit increases the output voltage appropriately. Waveform modulation circuit shapes the current into rectangular or spiked waveforms suitable for neuromuscular stimulation. Output electrodes deliver the current to the body. Electrodes are typically made of conductive materials with a layer of gel or sponge to ensure good contact with the skin.</p>
<p class="indent">So, let's summarize the <bold>production of Faradic current</bold> through the steps involved in it such as conversion of power, pulse generation, modulation and delivery to patient.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Conversion of power:</bold> The AC or DC power source is converted into a suitable form through rectifiers and transformers.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Pulse generation:</bold> The device generates short bursts of current in rapid succession, interrupted periodically to allow for muscle relaxation. The frequency (50–100 Hz) and pulse duration (0.1–1 ms) are precisely controlled to ensure safe and effective stimulation.<a name="page82"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">82</span></span></p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Modulation:</bold> Modulation circuits shape the pulses into specific waveforms (rectangular or spiked) for optimal stimulation of motor nerves.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Delivery to patient:</bold> The output current is passed to the electrodes, which are placed over the muscle motor points or target areas on the patient's body.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent"><bold>Safety features in Faradic stimulator machines</bold> include overcurrent protection, adjustable parameters, timers, and output indicators.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Overcurrent protection:</bold> Prevents excessive current delivery to the patient.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Adjustable parameters:</bold> Allows fine-tuning of intensity, frequency, and pulse duration.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Timers:</bold> Automatically stop the current after the prescribed treatment duration.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Output indicators:</bold> Visual or auditory indicators to monitor the current output.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">By controlling these parameters, Faradic current can be safely and effectively produced and applied for therapeutic purposes.</p>
<p class="indent"><bold>Devices used to produce Faradic current</bold> include Faradic stimulators and multimodal electrotherapy units.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Faradic stimulators:</bold> Dedicated devices or stand-alone types of devices are designed to produce Faradic current for physiotherapy. These devices allow control over parameters like intensity, frequency, and pulse duration.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Multimodal electrotherapy units:</bold> These devices produce Faradic current as well as some other therapeutic currents and it includes almost all modern devices that combine Faradic current generation with other electrical stimulation modalities, such as galvanic, TENS, or interferential currents.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch4lev3sec13"><h3 class="title">Interruption and Surging</h3>
<p class="noindent">Faradic current can be modified by interruption and surging. Hence, the two forms of modified Faradic current can be made available for treatment purpose. In case of interrupted Faradic current, the output is interrupted at regular intervals. Generally, it is used to avoid fatigue of muscles because of higher frequency such as 100 Hz. For plain and interrupted Faradic current, refer to <bold><a href="#ch4fig9" class="ulink-inter">Figures 4.9</a> and <a href="#ch4fig10" class="ulink-inter">4.10</a></bold>, respectively.</p>
<p class="indent">Surged Faradic current is a modification of Faradic current characterized by gradual increase in the intensity in such a manner that each impulse reaches higher intensity than that of the preceding one and after peak level it either falls suddenly or gradually.<a name="page83"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">83</span></span></p>
<div class="figure" id="ch4fig9" data-label="Fig. 4.9"><div class="title"><span class="item-label">Fig. 4.9</span> Plain Faradic current.</div><img alt="Fig. 4.9" src="/MediumImage/83-1.jpg"><div class="additional-markup"></div></div>
<div class="figure" id="ch4fig10" data-label="Fig. 4.10"><div class="title"><span class="item-label">Fig. 4.10</span> Interrupted Faradic current.</div><img alt="Fig. 4.10" src="/MediumImage/83-2.jpg"><div class="additional-markup"></div></div>
<p class="noindent">Surging is also termed as ramping. Surging is obtained automatically in case of modern stimulators using electronic devices. Advantages of surging are that it avoids fatigue, it does not surprise the patient as current slowly increases over time and not abruptly. Contraction of muscle is similar to physiological/voluntary contraction. Avoid or delay muscle fatigue and avoid elicitation of stretch reflex.</p>
<p class="indent">It is possible to get various surged durations, frequencies and waveform. Surged duration is the time taken by impulses to reach peak level of the intensity <bold>(<a href="#ch4fig11" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 4.11</a>)</bold>. That means, if the duration is more, impulses will take more time to reach peak level of intensity. Surged interval is an interval between two surged impulses and the number of surged impulses per unit time is surged frequency. Theoretically, frequency of impulses in surged impulses can be adjusted. Different waveforms such as, sawtooth, triangular and trapezoidal can be made available with surged Faradic current. In sawtooth waveform, the intensity of impulses increases gradually so as to reach peak level and after peak level it falls suddenly. In triangular waveform, the intensity of impulses increases gradually, so as to reach its peak level and after peak level it falls down gradually. In trapezoidal, the intensity of impulses increases gradually so as to reach peak level. At peak level, it remains for sometime and then it falls gradually.<a name="page84"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">84</span></span></p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="ch4lev3sec14"><h3 class="title">Physiological Effects</h3>
<p class="noindent">Physiological effects of original Faradic and Faradic type of current are stimulation of sensory nerves, stimulation of motor nerves, chemical effect, effect on denervated muscle, and effect of muscle contraction, increased metabolism.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch4lev4sec8"><h4 class="title">Stimulation of sensory nerves</h4>
<p class="noindent">When the Faradic type of current is applied to the body, then there is a feeling of mild prickling or tingling sensation as a result of stimulation of sensory nerves especially A β sensory fibers due to its pulsed nature. Repeated stimulation can increase local skin sensitivity, contributing to improved sensory awareness. Stimulation of sensory nerves also causes reflex vasodilation of superficial blood vessel leading to reddening of the skin or erythema.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch4lev4sec9"><h4 class="title">Stimulation of motor nerves</h4>
<p class="noindent">Faradic type of current stimulates motor nerves and if intensity is sufficient, then it will cause contraction of muscles supplied by it. These effects occur due to the ability of Faradic current (a low frequency interrupted current) to depolarize motor nerves, leading to muscle contractions. Faradic current stimulates α-motor neurons, causing rhythmic contractions of the innervated muscles. This helps to improve muscle tone and prevent atrophy in weak or inactive muscles. As stimulations are repeated 50 times per second or more, it produces tetanic contraction. If this type of contraction is continued for more than a short period of time, then muscle fatigue is produced and hence the current is surged or interrupted in order to give relaxation. The advantage of surging is that the strength of contraction increases gradually in such a manner that it is similar to voluntary contraction.<a name="page85"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">85</span></span></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch4lev4sec10"><h4 class="title">Chemical effect</h4>
<p class="noindent">A very negligible amount of chemicals is formed when Faradic current is applied, as the pulse duration is too small. Limited chemical effects of Faradic current occurs due to ionic movements and electrolyte redistribution.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch4lev4sec11"><h4 class="title">Effect on denervated muscle</h4>
<p class="noindent">Faradic current is never used for the stimulation of the denervated muscle. The intensity of current required to produce a contraction of denervated muscle with a Faradic current is usually too great to be tolerable for treatment purposes. Therefore, the Faradic current is not satisfactory for the stimulation of denervated muscles.</p>
<p class="indent">Faradic current is generally ineffective for denervated muscles. This is because Faradic current primarily stimulates motor nerves rather than the muscle fibers directly, and in denervated muscles, the motor nerve supply is either damaged or absent.</p>
<p class="indent">Here's a detailed explanation: Faradic current is a low-frequency, interrupted current that depolarizes intact motor nerves to induce muscle contractions. In denervated muscles, the motor nerve is no longer functional, and the muscle fibers cannot be stimulated indirectly via nerve excitation. Denervated muscles require direct muscle fiber stimulation, which can only be achieved using a long-duration pulse current (e.g., interrupted galvanic current or exponential current). The short pulse duration of Faradic current (&lt;1 ms) is insufficient to depolarize the muscle membrane directly. Lack of Motor nerve excitation: Faradic current relies on the presence of functional motor nerves, which are absent in denervated muscles. Threshold requirement: Denervated muscle fibers have a higher threshold for electrical stimulation, requiring currents with longer pulse durations (e.g., &gt;10 ms).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch4lev4sec12"><h4 class="title">Effect of muscle contraction</h4>
<p class="noindent">Electrical stimulation of muscles by Faradic current increases metabolism and pumping effect of muscles. Metabolism is a collective process, which consists of physical, chemical, anabolic and catabolic changes in the body tissues by which living state of body is maintained. As a result of muscle contraction due to electrical stimulation, metabolism is increased. Increased metabolism increases demand for oxygen and foodstuff and as a result of it, there is an increase in the output of waste products including metabolites. These metabolites cause dilation of capillaries and arterioles and increase the blood supply to the muscle.<a name="page86"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">86</span></span></p>
<p class="indent">As the muscle contracts and relaxes, it exerts a pumping action on veins and lymphatic vessels lying within and around them. The valves in this vessel direct the fluid towards the heart. If muscle contraction is strong and joint movement is also there then, both of these exert a pumping effect on vessels leading to increased venous and lymphatic return.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch4lev3sec15"><h3 class="title">Therapeutic Indications</h3>
<p class="noindent">Faradic current is primarily used to produce contraction of normally innervated muscles and current, usually surged so as to get contractions, which resembles or is similar to voluntary contractions.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch4lev4sec13"><h4 class="title">Facilitation of muscle</h4>
<p class="noindent">Muscle contraction can be facilitated by Faradic type of current. The facilitation effect of Faradic current can be used when a patient is unable to produce a muscle contraction or finds difficulty in doing so. Muscle contraction may be inhibited as a result of trauma, inflammation, pain and surgery, etc. (<bold>Mnemonic: ‘TIPS’</bold>). Here, Faradic current stimulation is used in assisting voluntary contraction, for example, Faradic stimulation of the quadriceps following meniscectomy. The patient should be encouraged to attempt voluntary contraction at the same time to get voluntary control by minimizing inhibition. Facilitation of muscles using Faradic current refers to the use of this electrical stimulation to enhance muscle function, typically in cases where muscle activity is weak or requires retraining. Faradic current is particularly effective in muscles with intact motor nerve supply.</p>
<p class="noindent"><bold>Clinical applications:</bold> These include postsurgical muscle inhibition, neurological rehabilitation, muscle imbalance or postural issues and sports injuries.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Postsurgical muscle weakness:</bold> Facilitates recovery of muscle strength after orthopedic or neurological surgeries.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Neurological rehabilitation:</bold> Helps retrain weak muscles in patients with conditions like stroke, cerebral palsy, or peripheral nerve injuries (if motor nerves are intact).<a name="page87"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">87</span></span></p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Muscle imbalance or postural issues:</bold> Strengthens weaker muscles to restore balance and correct posture.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Sports recovery:</bold> Used in athletes to maintain or restore muscle function after injuries.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent"><bold>Procedure for muscle facilitation:</bold> Place the electrodes over the motor points of the muscle to ensure effective stimulation. Use the current parameters:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Pulse duration:</bold> Short (&lt;1 ms) to effectively stimulate motor nerves.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Frequency:</bold> Moderate (50–100 Hz) for tetanic contractions without fatigue.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Intensity:</bold> Adjusted to elicit visible and comfortable muscle contractions and</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Treatment duration:</bold> Typically, 10–30 minutes per session, depending on the muscle's condition and therapeutic goals.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="noindent"><bold>Precautions:</bold> Ensure the motor nerve supply is intact; Faradic current is ineffective for denervated muscles and monitor for muscle fatigue; prolonged stimulation may tire the muscle.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch4lev4sec14"><h4 class="title">Muscle re-education</h4>
<p class="noindent">Muscle action can be re-educated, if voluntary muscle action is lost as a result of prolonged disease or incorrect use. For instance, re- education of abductor hallucis in hallux valgus. Here, the current is applied in such a way that it produces the abduction of the great toe.</p>
<p class="indent">Muscle re-education using Faradic current is a therapeutic technique to restore muscle strength, coordination, and functional movement patterns, particularly after injury, surgery, or neurological impairments. Faradic current is effective for re-educating muscles with an intact motor nerve supply by mimicking natural nerve impulses. Various goals of muscle re-education include restoring voluntary muscle control, preventing muscle atrophy, improving neuromuscular coordination, enhancing circulation, and metabolism, and supporting functional recovery. Since it is believed that Faradic current helps patients regain control over muscles that have become weak or poorly coordinated, maintains muscle mass and tone in cases of disuse, trains the brain and muscles to work together efficiently, improves oxygen delivery and waste removal in the target muscles and assists in achieving specific movement patterns needed for daily activities. A possible mechanism is that repeated contractions provide sensory feedback, helping patients relearn proper movement patterns. This is often used after orthopedic or neurological surgeries (e.g., ACL reconstruction, total knee replacement), stroke, peripheral nerve injuries, or conditions like Bell's palsy, following prolonged immobilization or inactivity and training muscles for specific tasks like walking, grasping, or maintaining posture.<a name="page88"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">88</span></span> Advantages of this technique include non-invasive and well-tolerated, helps prevent secondary complications such as joint stiffness and adhesions and encourages faster recovery by reinforcing natural movement patterns. Avoid in denervated muscles (use galvanic current instead), monitor for muscle fatigue or overuse and it is contraindicated in patients with pacemakers, epilepsy, or skin lesions at electrode sites.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch4lev4sec15"><h4 class="title">New muscle action</h4>
<p class="noindent">After tendon transplantation or other reconstruction operations, Faradic current can be used for training of new muscle action. Muscle is stimulated so as to produce new action or movement. During stimulation, the patient should attempt to perform voluntary contraction. Once the patient is able to perform new movements actively without electric stimulation, then electric stimulation is discontinued.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch4lev4sec16"><h4 class="title">Motor nerve neurapraxia</h4>
<p class="noindent">Faradic stimulation to the paralyzed muscles can be applied following neurapraxic lesion of the motor nerve. Electrical stimulation can be given till voluntary control is developed. However, electrical stimulation may not be needed in neurapraxia as recovery takes place without any marked changes in the muscle tissue.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch4lev4sec17"><h4 class="title">Blood supply</h4>
<p class="noindent">Faradic current can cause reflex vasodilation and hence, can be used for increase in blood supply in conditions where heat treatment may not be a safe choice. For this purpose, sensory level intensity is applied with bath method of application.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch4lev4sec18"><h4 class="title">Effect on edema</h4>
<p class="noindent">Faradic current can be used in the treatment of edema for improving venous and lymphatic drainage. Faradism under pressure method of Faradic current application can be used for this purpose.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch4lev3sec16"><h3 class="title">Uses of Faradic Current</h3>
<p class="noindent">Faradic current can be used in the treatment of muscle inhibition, edema, incontinence, hallux valgus, Bell's palsy (neurapraxic lesion), metatarsalgia, postural flat-feet, after tendo-Achilles surgery, after knee surgeries, rheumatoid arthritis, tendon transplantation, later stages of peripheral nerve injuries, chilblain, muscle spasm, pain relief by counter-irritation, etc.<a name="page89"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">89</span></span></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch4lev3sec17"><h3 class="title">Methods of Application</h3>
<p class="noindent">Faradic current can be applied by various methods such as motor point stimulation, labile, stabile, nerve conduction method, bath method, under pressure faradism, etc.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch4lev4sec19"><h4 class="title">Motor point stimulation</h4>
<p class="noindent">Motor point stimulation involves stimulation of individual muscle. In this method, an indifferent electrode is placed at the origin of muscle and an active disk electrode (handle/pen electrode) is placed at motor point. With this method almost each and every muscle can be stimulated and thus effect of passive exercise can be given to each and every muscle. However, it is somewhat difficult to stimulate deeply situated muscles with this method. <span class="italic">Advantages</span> of this method are, contraction of individual muscle can be obtained, each and every muscle can be stimulated and isolated muscle contraction can be obtained in the treatment of various conditions, for example, stimulation of abductor hallucis in hallux valgus. However, there are some <span class="italic">disadvantages</span> of this method such as, it is <span class="italic">tedious, time- consuming, trial error</span> method and it is difficult to stimulate deeply situated muscles (<bold>Mnemonic</bold>: ‘3T deep’).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch4lev4sec20"><h4 class="title">Labile method</h4>
<p class="noindent">Labile method can be used for stimulation of large muscles with multiple nerve supply for example trunk muscles. Here, an indifferent electrode is placed at the origin of muscle or muscles and an active electrode either disk or small plate electrode is moved over the area to be treated. During this method, current is not usually surged. As the active electrode approaches and leaves the motor point of a muscle, that muscle contracts and relaxes.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch4lev4sec21"><h4 class="title">Nerve conduction method</h4>
<p class="noindent">In nerve conduction method, an indifferent electrode is placed at convenient area and an active electrode to a point at which the nerve trunk is superficial. It will stimulate motor nerve trunk and will cause contractions of all the muscles that it supplies beyond the point of stimulation. Nerve trunk stimulation causes contraction of all muscles innervated by the nerve, that is stimulated. This method is used when it is not possible to use other methods conveniently, for example, in case of wound, splint and edema.<a name="page90"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">90</span></span></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch4lev4sec22"><h4 class="title">Bath method</h4>
<p class="noindent">Application of Faradic current to the body parts in a tub, tray or tank containing water is termed as bath method of application. Depending upon the placement of electrodes, bath can be of bipolar or unipolar type. In bipolar, both electrodes are kept in the bath and in case of unipolar, only one electrode is kept in the bath while the other one is kept at any convenient part of the body, which is not immersed in the water. Bath method is commonly used for the application of Faradic current to the foot, and which is often termed as Faradic footbath. <span class="italic">Advantages</span> of bath method are that skin resistance is lowered considerably by water and in addition to this, water makes perfect contact with the tissues. <span class="italic">Disadvantages</span> of this method of application are that the current cannot be localized, superficial muscles contract to a greater extent than deeper ones due to the presence of water, chances of electric shock is greater as water can make earthing easily available.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Faradism under pressure method is used in the treatment of edema to increase the venous and lymphatic drainage from the</span> <span class="italic">edematous area</span>. Here, the Faradic current is applied along with an elastic bandage such as elastocrepe bandage and the body part, which is to be treated, is kept elevated during treatment. This form of treatment is applied for 15 to 20 minutes only. Faradism under pressure (FUP) is a specialized electrotherapy treatment technique used in physiotherapy to stimulate muscles while applying external compression. It combines Faradic current with manual or mechanical pressure to enhance muscle activation, improve circulation, and address specific conditions like edema, muscle weakness, or impaired venous return. In this technique, intermittent and short-duration pulses (low-frequency, typically 50–100 Hz) to stimulate motor nerves, causing muscle contraction along with manual or mechanical compression with the help of crepe or elastocrepe bandage applied to enhance the effect of muscle contractions by promoting venous return and lymphatic drainage. Faradism under pressure reduces fluid accumulation in dependent areas (e.g., post-surgical or postinjury swelling), improves blood flow in conditions like varicose veins, prevents disuse atrophy and aids in re-educating muscles, assists in lymphatic drainage, especially in lymphedema and helps in regaining muscle function and reducing swelling.</p>

<p class="noindent">Here, the active electrode is placed in the perineal region or rectum or vagina and an indifferent electrode over lumbosacral region.<a name="page91"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">91</span></span> This method of application can be used in prolapse of pelvic organs, stress, incontinence, etc. Pelvic floor stimulation with Faradic current is a therapeutic intervention used in physiotherapy to treat pelvic floor dysfunctions. It involves the application of Faradic electrical stimulation to the pelvic floor muscles to help improve their strength and function. Therapeutic uses or applications of Faradic stimulation in pelvic floor therapy include urinary incontinence (stress incontinence, urge incontinence, genuine incontinence) due to weak pelvic floor muscles, overactive bladder, pelvic floor weakness due to pregnancy, muscle atrophy due to disuse, chronic pelvic pain due to hypertonic pelvic muscles and sexual dysfunction since pelvic floor faradism improves muscle tone and enhances sexual health. Usually, intravaginal or intrarectal electrodes designed for this purpose target the pelvic floor muscles. Alternatively, surface electrodes can be placed over the perineum if internal electrodes are not suitable. Stimulation parameters used for this purpose include pulse duration: 0.1–1 millisecond, frequency: 50–100 Hz, intensity: Adjusted to produce visible muscle contraction without discomfort. Duration: 10–30 minutes per session. Monitor for discomfort or adverse reactions and adjust parameters accordingly. One can combine this with pelvic floor exercises (Kegels) for optimal results and continue for regular sessions (e.g., 2–3 times per week) for a few weeks.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Interrupted direct current</span> <bold>(<a href="#ch4fig12" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 4.12</a>)</bold> <span class="italic">is also known as modified direct current or interrupted galvanic current</span>. Interrupted direct current is commonly used for stimulation of denervated muscles and for electrodiagnostic purpose. It is a modified type of direct current characterized by commencement and cessation of the current flow at regular intervals. In other words, it is a current, whose flow stops and starts at regular intervals.</p>
<div class="figure" id="ch4fig12" data-label="Fig. 4.12"><div class="title"><span class="item-label">Fig. 4.12</span> Interrupted direct current.</div><img alt="Fig. 4.12" src="/MediumImage/91-1.jpg"><div class="additional-markup"></div></div>
<p class="noindent"><a name="page92"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">92</span></span>Impulse duration ranges between 0.01 m/s to 3,000 m/s and the frequency vary as per the pulse duration and the interval selected between them. For instance, if the impulse duration is 100 milliseconds, then the frequency is 30 cycles per second. The pulses used in interrupted direct current can be called long-duration and short-duration pulses. Long-duration pulses are those whose duration is &gt;10 millisecond and short-duration are those whose duration is &lt;10 milliseconds. Various waveforms of interrupted direct current, such as sawtooth, triangular, depolarized, trapezoidal and rectangular can be used in clinical applications. (Memorize with ST, DTR It is not standard deep tendon reflex! But it is sawtooth, triangular, depolarized, trapezoidal and rectangular).</p>
<div class="section" id="ch4lev2sec7"><h2 class="title">Production</h2>
<p class="noindent">Interrupted direct current for the treatment can be availed from battery or electricity operated stimulator. Electronic muscle stimulator works on multivibrator or flip-flap circuit (<span class="italic">refer</span> <bold><a href="#ch4fig13" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 4.13</a>)</bold>.</p>
<p class="indent">The production of interrupted direct current (IDC) for muscle stimulation in electrotherapy involves the controlled application of direct current (DC) that is periodically interrupted or modulated. This type of current is widely used in physiotherapy to stimulate denervated muscles and promote recovery. The flow of current is interrupted at regular intervals, creating pulses. This interruption is necessary for stimulating denervated muscles since they do not respond well to continuous DC. Components of IDC production included power supply and pulse generator. The power supply or source is typically from a rectified AC or a battery. A pulse generator is a device or circuit that interrupts the current at specific frequencies and durations. These interruptions are controlled to deliver pulses suitable for muscle stimulation. Pulse parameters include frequency, in the range of 1–100 Hz for IDC in muscle stimulation, pulse duration in the range of 0.3–1.0 milliseconds, and rest intervals to prevent fatigue during treatment.</p>
<div class="figure" id="ch4fig13" data-label="Fig. 4.13"><div class="title"><span class="item-label">Fig. 4.13</span> Block diagram of muscle stimulator circuit.</div><img alt="Fig. 4.13" src="/MediumImage/92-1.jpg"><div class="additional-markup"></div></div>
<p class="noindent"><a name="page93"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">93</span></span>Electrodes (usually one active and one dispersive) are used to apply the IDC to the target area. Modern physiotherapy equipment incorporates IDC generation circuits and offers customizable settings for current intensity that is adjusted based on patient comfort and therapeutic goals, pulse rate selected based on the muscle's response and type of denervation, and duration of application typically 10 to 30 minutes per session. The mechanism of muscle stimulation is, that IDC delivers a stimulus to the denervated muscle fibers, bypassing the nerve, the stimulus causes a contraction by directly depolarizing the muscle membrane and this helps maintain muscle bulk, improve circulation, and prevent atrophy. Clinically IDC is specifically used for denervated muscles to maintain muscle viability and prevent atrophy. Facilitation of nerve regeneration encouraging muscle contraction and blood flow. Postpolio syndrome in cases with residual denervation. Key considerations are the precise placement of the active electrode over the motor point or muscle belly, avoiding excessive current intensity to prevent pain, burns or any discomfort during the treatment and monitoring to avoid fatigue or overstimulation of the muscle.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch4lev2sec8"><h2 class="title">Physiological and Therapeutic Effects</h2>
<p class="noindent">Physiological effects of interrupted direct current are stimulation of sensory nerves, stimulation of motor nerves, effect of muscle contraction, increased metabolism, effect on denervated muscle and chemical effect.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch4lev3sec18"><h3 class="title">Sensory Nerve Stimulation</h3>
<p class="noindent">When interrupted direct current is applied to the body, there is feeling of stabbing or burning sensation as a result of stimulation of sensory nerves. Stimulation of sensory nerves also causes reflex vasodilation of superficial blood vessels leading to reddening of the skin or erythema.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch4lev3sec19"><h3 class="title">Motor Nerve Stimulation</h3>
<p class="noindent">Interrupted direct current stimulates motor nerves and if intensity is sufficient then it will cause contraction of muscles supplied by it. It produces very brisk contraction followed by immediate relaxation of innervated muscles but sluggish contraction of denervated muscles occur, if impulse duration is adequate. Sluggish contraction means worm-like slow contraction and relaxation <bold>(<a href="#ch4fig14" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 4.14</a>)</bold>.<a name="page94"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">94</span></span></p>
<div class="figure" id="ch4fig14" data-label="Fig. 4.14"><div class="title"><span class="item-label">Fig. 4.14</span> Brisk and sluggish contraction.</div><img alt="Fig. 4.14" src="/MediumImage/94-1.jpg"><div class="additional-markup"></div></div>
<p class="noindent">Since interrupted direct current can produce the contractions of denervated muscles, it is commonly used in the treatment of peripheral nerve injuries to stimulate the muscles, so as to prevent or minimize the possibility of atrophy, degeneration and fibrosis of muscles following denervation (<bold>Mnemonic:</bold> ‘FAD’ where F: fibrosis, A: atrophy and D: degeneration). However, it should be remembered that therapeutic electrical stimulation does not accelerate the rate of regeneration following peripheral nerve injuries or neuropathies.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch4lev3sec20"><h3 class="title">Effect on Denervated Muscle</h3>
<p class="noindent">Following denervation, muscles undergo various changes. These changes include paralysis, flaccidity, atrophy, decreased muscle weight, decreased muscle protein, decreased sarcoplasm, decrease in number of muscle fibers, replacement by fibrous and adipose tissues, and degeneration. Stimulation of denervated muscle improves its nutrition by increasing blood supply. Further on, blood supply is increased due to muscle contractions, as a result of pumping effect. As a result of electrical stimulation, nutrition of muscles is improved and this in turn retards atrophy, degeneration and fibrosis. For this purpose, electrical stimulation can be applied to produce 90 contractions of each muscle every day. But this is controversial, various trends followed are 10 to 30 contractions, 30 to 300 contractions per day or three times per week. I personally feel that these variations are as per the convenience of the therapist and patients.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch4lev3sec21"><h3 class="title">Chemical Effect</h3>
<p class="noindent">Very negligible amount of chemicals is formed when interrupted direct current is applied since there is pause or rest in between any two impulses.<a name="page95"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">95</span></span></p>
<p class="indent">As the muscles contract and relax, they exert a pumping action on veins and lymphatic vessels lying within and around them. The valves in these vessels direct the fluid towards the heart. If muscle contraction is strong and moreover, if there is joint movement then, both of these exert a pumping effect on vessels leading to increased venous and lymphatic return.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch4lev3sec22"><h3 class="title">Pole Used for Stimulation</h3>
<p class="noindent">Usually, cathode is used as an active electrode, but sometimes a greater response can be obtained from the anode and hence, it should be decided based on the clinical situation and as per the response to these poles in denervated muscles.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch4lev2sec9"><h2 class="title">Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation</h2>
<p class="noindent">Neuromuscular electrical stimulation is becoming one of the popular treatment approaches due to the ease of application and modern look of these machines. Use of electricity to stimulate the nerves that correspond to a targeted muscle or muscle group and cause it to contract has been traditionally termed as neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES). Neuromuscular electrical stimulation requires an intact peripheral nerve and healthy muscle tissue. The waveform selection can be bi-directional, symmetrical or asymmetrical. <span class="italic">Symmetrical waveforms are preferred for large muscles and asymmetrical waveforms are preferred for small muscles</span>. Intensity or magnitude of intensity determines the amount of muscular response. Higher amplitudes generate a greater muscular response due to an increase in the number of motor units activated.</p>
<p class="indent">In <span class="italic">symmetrical waveform</span>, both electrodes are active, and one should use negative electrode preferably over motor point, while in <span class="italic">asymmetrical waveform</span>, negative electrode is more active and place the negative electrode over the motor point. Distance between electrodes will determine depth of current, it is found that greater the distance, deeper is the flow of current. Frequency or rate of repetition of impulse determines the quality of a muscle contraction and fatigue. Usually, 25 to 50 pulses per second rate of repetition that causes tetanic contraction is used. Higher rates like 80 pulses per second elicit muscle fatigue. Using the minimum rate produces a good, tetanized contraction that will help to control onset of fatigue. However, using higher rate produces fatigue and it can be used for the relief of muscle spasm. Ramp or surge up/down time can be adjusted since, it helps to offer comfort of treatment and can be used to mimic normal recruitment or physiological contraction. Typical ramp up, is up to 3 seconds but higher ramp time may be beneficial in minimizing stretch reflex when spasticity is a factor. Clinical uses of NMES are to retard or prevent disuse atrophy, muscle re-education, increase local blood circulation, maintain or increase joint mobility, relax muscle spasm, prevent venous thrombosis in calf muscles and immediately after surgery.<a name="page96"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">96</span></span></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch4lev2sec10"><h2 class="title">Uses and Methods of Application</h2>
<p class="noindent">Interrupted direct current is used in the treatment of denervated muscles and for electrodiagnostic tests such as strength-duration curves, Faradic interrupted direct current test, pulse ratio, etc. Interrupted direct current can also be used for healing purpose. For this purpose, sub-sensory thresholds have been used, and this is termed as low intensity direct current therapy (LIDC). Methods of application commonly used in the treatment with interrupted direct current are motor point, stabile and labile.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch4lev2sec11"><h2 class="title">Location of Motor Points</h2>
<p class="noindent">Use these guidelines to find out the motor points during therapeutic stimulation purpose. These guidelines may work in few individuals. Try with these guidelines just three times and if you do not get the motor points, then you can search at any other location by trial-and-error method.</p>

<p class="noindent">Peripheral nerve injuries mainly occur due to pressure, trauma and exposure to cold (<bold>Mnemonic</bold>: ‘CPT’ where C: cold, P: pressure and T: trauma). These peripheral nerve injuries can be classified, so as to get an idea about their nature of injury, severity, prognosis and treatment planning. There are various classifications of peripheral nerve injuries such as, Seddon's classification, Sunderland's classification and Schaumburg, Thomas and Spencer's classification.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch4lev2sec17"><h2 class="title">Seddon's Classification</h2>
<p class="noindent">As per Seddon's classification, peripheral nerve injuries can be classified as neuropraxia, axonotmesis and neurotmesis.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch4lev3sec26"><h3 class="title">Neuropraxia</h3>
<p class="noindent">It is a type of peripheral nerve injury characterized by transient physiological conduction block without any significant pathological changes. For example, neuropraxic lesion of the facial nerve in Bell's palsy. Neuropraxia causes transient ischemia at the point of nerve injury, which leads to degeneration of the myelin sheath and hence physiological conduction block occurs at the site of nerve injury. However, there is no loss of axonal continuity, there is no Wallerian degeneration. Nerve deficit is completely reversible.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch4lev3sec27"><h3 class="title">Axonotmesis</h3>
<p class="noindent">It is a type of nerve injury characterized by intrathecal rupture of axons or nerve fibers. For example, the radial nerve injury associated with fracture of the shaft of humerus. Pathologically, there is rupture of the nerve fibers, but the myelin sheath remains intact. Axon undergoes the Wallerian degeneration in its distal cut end and up to the first node of Ranvier proximally. There is complete loss of nerve conduction distal to the injury.<a name="page102"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">102</span></span></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch4lev3sec28"><h3 class="title">Neurotmesis</h3>
<p class="noindent">It is a type of peripheral nerve injury characterized by rupture of both nerve sheath as well as nerve fiber. Neurotmesis may be partial or complete. In partial neurotmesis, only the portion of nerve is cut. In complete neurotmesis nerve is divided across its whole thickness. Example of this nerve injury can be complete ulnar nerve cut as a result of glass cut injury. Pathological changes in form of Wallerian degeneration occur in distal part of the cut end of the nerve and up to the first node of Ranvier proximally. Disruption of Schwann cells and endoneurium connective tissue also occurs. There is complete loss of conduction distal to the site of nerve injury.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch4lev2sec18"><h2 class="title">Sunderland's Classification</h2>
<p class="noindent">Peripheral nerve injuries are classified as first degree, second degree, third degree, fourth degree and fifth degree injuries. First and second-degree injuries are similar to neuropraxia and axonotmesis, respectively. Neurotmesis type of injuries comprise third-, fourth- and fifth-degree injuries. In third degree injury, there is interruption of nerve fibers. In fourth degree, there is connective tissue damage in addition to interruption of nerve fibers. In fifth degree, there is severance of nerve, in addition to above changes.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch4lev2sec19"><h2 class="title">Schaumburg, Spencer and Thomas Classification</h2>
<p class="noindent">Schaumburg, Spencer and Thomas classification classify the peripheral nerve injuries into class one, class two and class three types of injuries. Class one is same as that of neuropraxia, class two is similar to axonotmesis, and class three is like neurotmesis.</p>
</div>
</div><div class="section" id="ch4lev1sec6"><h1 class="title">TRANSCUTANEOUS ELECTRICAL NERVE STIMULATION</h1>
<p class="noindent">It is a form of peripheral electrical nerve stimulation through the skin, which is used to obtain electroanalgesia. In the past, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) equipment was also used as nerve tracers for the search of percutaneous nerves, for maintenance of muscle activity after the stroke and for muscle development. Today, TENS is one of the most commonly used electrotherapeutic modalities for pain relief.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch4lev2sec20"><h2 class="title">Historical Aspects</h2>
<p class="noindent">In the first century <span class="italic">ad</span> Scribonius Largus described the use of electrical shocks for the relief of chronic pain. The Roman and Greek physicians have reported the use of certain species of fish for pain relief such as Torpedo marmorata, Malapterus and Gymnotus electricus which had an organ that produced electric charges.<a name="page103"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">103</span></span> Typically, the fish was kept in contact with the area of the body experiencing pain to produce a series of electrical shocks. These crude methods continued until the mid of the 18th century. During 1745, Leyden jar was introduced and the same was used as power source for electroanalgesia. During the 19th century, the development of battery and induction coil added further sophistication. Introduction of electroanalgesia into the medical profession was met with considerable skepticism and inevitable opposition to this concept. Due to this and variable clinical results, there was decline in the interest towards the end of 19th century in the use of electrical stimulation as a means of pain relief. In addition to this, in 20th century, the increased number of analgesics turned the interest away from the use of peripheral stimulation as a pain-relieving mode. But in 1965, Ronald Melzack and Patrick Wall published their gate control theory and hence the interest again reawakened in the use of electrical stimulation as a pain-relieving mode.</p>
<p class="indent">During the same period (1960s), dorsal column stimulators were introduced. Dorsal column stimulators involved the surgical implantation of electrodes in dorsal column of spinal cord, which were activated by an external battery-operated device. Dr Norman Shealy initially used the battery-operated device as a screening device to establish the patient's candidacy for dorsal column stimulator implantation surgery. If patients responded favorably to such external transcutaneous stimulation, then this was taken as an indication that they would respond positively to dorsal column stimulator. But Norman Shealy noted that some of his patients responded better to transcutaneous stimulation, than to dorsal column stimulation and so TENS was discovered almost accidentally. This discovery initiated a new era for electroanalgesia. Meyer and Fields (1972) were the first to report clinical use of TENS for the relief of chronic pain. In the following years, researchers and manufacturers together developed several types of TENS devices with a range of adjustable parameters. A portable TENS device is shown in <bold><a href="#ch4fig16" class="ulink-inter">Figure 4.16</a>.</bold></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch4lev2sec21"><h2 class="title">Characteristics</h2>
<div class="section" id="ch4lev3sec29"><h3 class="title">Frequency</h3>
<p class="noindent">In conventional TENS, it is 10 to 100 Hz and in modern TENS it may vary from 2 to 600 Hz. Frequency is adjustable in both the types of TENS equipment.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Pulse width:</bold> The pulse width varies from 50 to 300 microseconds. Pulse width is also adjustable.<a name="page104"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">104</span></span></p></li>
</ul>
<div class="figure" id="ch4fig16" data-label="Fig. 4.16"><div class="title"><span class="item-label">Fig. 4.16</span> Portable TENS device.</div><img alt="Fig. 4.16" src="/MediumImage/104-1.jpg"><div class="additional-markup"></div></div>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Pulse shape:</bold> Pulse shape is usually modified rectangular.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Output of intensity:</bold> It varies from 0 to 60 milliamperes.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch4lev2sec22"><h2 class="title">Modulation of TENS</h2>
<p class="noindent">It is believed that the body tissues may get accommodated to TENS current and hence to prevent this, TENS current is modulated. Gradual and continuous change in one or more than one parameters of TENS current, in order to prevent accommodation, is known as TENS modulation. It can be brought about by changes in frequency or pulse width or amplitude or all of it together. Usually, 10% modulation is used. Frequency modulation is characterized by gradual and continuous changes in frequency. For example, if modulated frequency is selected as 100 Hz, then frequency will gradually vary from 90 to 100 in a manner like 90, 91, 92…100 and once again the same trend will be continued. In pulse width modulation, there will be gradual and continuous changes in pulse width. In amplitude modulation, there is continuous and automatic variation in amplitude. In burst modulation, the output is in form of groups of stimuli ranging from one to ten. In train modulation, the output is similar to the arrangement of bogies in a freight train.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch4lev2sec23"><h2 class="title">Classification of TENS</h2>
<p class="noindent">Depending on the frequency and its use, TENS is divided into two types namely, <span class="italic">high frequency TENS</span> and <span class="italic">low frequency TENS</span>. High frequency TENS is also known as high frequency and low intensity TENS.<a name="page105"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">105</span></span> Here the frequency is above 50 Hz. It is used for acute pain. While applying this form of TENS, only perceptible intensity is used. Low frequency TENS is also known as low frequency and high intensity TENS. Here, the frequency is below 50 Hz. It is used for chronic pain and while applying this type of TENS, high intensity is used. TENS is also classified as <bold>acupuncture TENS</bold> (0.4 to 4 Hz), <bold>burst TENS</bold> (1 to 10 Hz), <bold>conventional TENS</bold> (10 to 100 Hz), etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch4lev2sec24"><h2 class="title">Mechanism of Analgesia</h2>
<p class="noindent">Exact mechanism of analgesia is not known. The electroanalgesia by TENS may occur as per the endorphin theory or gate control theory.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch4lev3sec30"><h3 class="title">Endorphin Theory</h3>
<p class="noindent">TENS causes stimulation and increase in circulation of endorphins. Endorphins are morphine like endogenous transmitter substances. They occur naturally in brain and pituitary glands. Endorphins from the brain circulate and block pain sensation as a result of TENS application.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch4lev3sec31"><h3 class="title">Gate Control Theory</h3>
<p class="noindent">Dr Ronald Melzack and Patrick Wall described the gate control theory in 1965, to explain the mechanism of analgesia. The theme of this theory is—pain may be blocked at various gates through which pain impulse travels to the brain. These gates are located at neuronal synapses in the spinal cord.</p>
<p class="indent">Information leading to pain generation passes through gate and depends upon the balance activity in large and small afferent nerve fibers and in the fibers descending from higher centers <bold>(<a href="#ch4fig17" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 4.17</a>)</bold>. The transmission of pain sensation depends upon the activation of the transmission cell (T) by large or small nerve fibers. The amount of transmission from these fibers to the T cell is governed in turn by the action of a further cell in substantia gelatinosa of spinal cord (SG). It produces its effect by presynaptic and postsynaptic inhibition. Substantia gelatinosa cell is activated from the collateral branches from large fibers, chiefly those ascending in the dorsal columns of spinal cord dealing with proprioception and touch. It is inhibited by small fiber activity namely, those known to be concerned with pain generation.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Normal circumstances:</span> In normal circumstances, there is low but constant rate of activity in small fibers, which maintain a state of readiness to transmit noxious stimulus. But normally, the activity of large fibers predominates and hence T cell transmission for pain is inhibited via SG cell.<a name="page106"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">106</span></span></p>
<div class="figure" id="ch4fig17" data-label="Fig. 4.17"><div class="title"><span class="item-label">Fig. 4.17</span> Gate control theory.</div><img alt="Fig. 4.17" src="/MediumImage/106-1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p class="">(L: large diameter nerve fibers which carry proprioceptive impulses mainly, S: small diameter nerve fibers which mainly carry pain impulses, SG: substantia gelatinosa, T: transmission cell, AS: activating system and CC: central control)</p></div><div class="additional-markup"></div></div>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Opening of gate:</span> When the number of noxious impulses rises in small fibers, then there is simultaneous activity in large fibers, which initially inhibit discharge of T cell by action upon the SG cell. However, summation takes place in small fibers and activity reaches a point at which the SG cell is inhibited by it and T cell becomes active. The gate is opened and transmission to the brain takes place and patient feels pain. Central activity also influences the situation; thus, it may facilitate or inhibit pain information. For example, in heightened anxiety, the level of pain is increased, as it seems that the activity generated in the limbic system of brain and transmitted via reticular formation of brainstem results in opening of gate. On the other hand, pain may not be experienced while an individual is engaged in a sporting contest. Perhaps, it may be due to the inhibitory effects of higher centers, which closes the gate.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">TENS and closing of gate:</span> Stimulation of large nerve fibers by TENS activate SG cell and inhibit the discharge of T cell probably by its effect via presynaptic or postsynaptic inhibition. This closes the gate and causes analgesia. The duration for which this gate remains closed varies and is directly proportional to the number of noxious impulses in small fibers.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Sodium-potassium (Na-K) pump and pain relief by TENS:</span> Repetitive antidromic stimulation of postsynaptic axon can alter extracellular potassium ion concentration and reduces the excitatory postsynaptic potential.</p>

<div class="section" id="ch4lev2sec25"><h2 class="title">Indications</h2>
<p class="noindent">TENS is used commonly for electroanalgesia in many conditions:<a name="page107"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">107</span></span></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">

<li><p class=""><bold>Psychogenic and phantom pain:</bold> These pains also can be treated with TENS.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch4lev2sec26"><h2 class="title">Contraindications and Precautions</h2>
<p class="noindent">TENS is contraindicated in patients with cardiac pacemaker, recent bleeding, compromised circulation due to peripheral vascular disorders, over anterior aspect of neck or carotid sinus, patients who have an allergic response to gel, electrode or tape, application of the electrodes over the trunk, abdomen or pelvis during pregnancy, except if using TENS for labor pain, dermatological conditions like eczema and dermatitis and patients who do not comprehend the physiotherapist's instructions or who are unable to cooperate.</p>
<p class="indent">Precautions should be taken while applying TENS in area of the mouth, and on the eyelids. Patients who have epilepsy should be treated at the discretion of the physiotherapist in consultation with the neurologist, also so in patients with arrhythmias or myocardial disease, undiagnosed pain (since it can mask the important diagnostic symptom). If there is abnormal skin sensation, the electrodes should preferably be positioned in a site other than this area to ensure effective stimulation.<a name="page108"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">108</span></span> Avoid active epiphyseal regions in children. Keep the TENS device out of reach of children. The use of abdominal electrodes during labor may interfere with fetal monitoring equipment. There are no side effects except skin irritation, which may occur sometimes. To prevent it, it is necessary to wash the area of application and electrode following treatment.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch4lev2sec27"><h2 class="title">Electrode Placement in TENS</h2>
<p class="noindent">Various electrodes such as, carbon impregnated, silicon rubber or pad electrodes can be used for TENS applications. Carbon electrodes or silicon rubber electrodes of various sizes can be used as per requirement. Three sizes such as 45 × 45, 45 × 95, and 45 × 190 mm are commonly used. But the choice of the size varies on the extent of the area to be treated. Carbon or silicon rubber electrodes can be kept in good contact with the skin with the help of electroconductive gel. Electrodes are usually placed over spinal cord segment, acupuncture point, over painful dermatome, over and around painful area, over nerve trunk, over tender spot and over trigger points. (<bold>Mnemonic:</bold> ‘SAD ANTT’ where S: spinal segment, A: area of pain, D: dermatome, A: acupuncture, N: nerve trunk, T: tender spot and T: trigger point).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch4lev2sec28"><h2 class="title">Dosimetry</h2>
<p class="noindent">In acute pain, high frequency and low or perceptible intensity TENS can be applied for 20 minutes and in chronic pain, low frequency TENS can be applied with high or tolerable intensity for 30 minutes. Number of sessions can be once to thrice a day as per the requirement. However, if the intensity of pain is very severe then TENS can even be applied for 8 to 24 hours.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch4lev2sec29"><h2 class="title">Benefits of TENS</h2>
<p class="noindent">Due to reduced pain, exercise program can progress, activities of daily living may be improved, faster reduction in pain facilitates early return to work, there is no side effect with TENS, TENS reduces cost of medications, early ambulation in postoperative cases can be achieved, TENS is noninvasive, nontoxic and nonpharmacological.</p>
<p class="indent">TENS is a versatile tool that can significantly enhance pain management and rehabilitation outcomes, making it a cornerstone of physiotherapy treatment strategies. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) offers several therapeutic benefits, primarily for managing pain and improving function. Complements physiotherapy exercises, manual therapy, or postsurgical rehabilitation.<a name="page109"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">109</span></span> It enhances outcomes when combined with other modalities like ultrasound or heat therapy. TENS is even available in portable, battery-operated device forms. It reduces pain levels, enabling patients to perform daily activities with greater ease. Improves sleep by reducing discomfort, especially in chronic pain conditions. Reduces pain and reliance on opioids after surgeries like joint replacements. Safe and noninvasive pain relief option during childbirth. Alleviates symptoms of diabetic neuropathy, sciatica, and phantom limb pain. Unlike medications, TENS has minimal side effects when used appropriately. Reduces anxiety and improves mood through pain management, empowers patients with a self-managed approach to pain relief.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch4lev2sec30"><h2 class="title">H-wave Therapy</h2>
<p class="noindent">H-wave therapy (HWT) is a form of electrical stimulation that is used for electroanalgesia. In the beginning, it was recommended as an alternative to TENS for dental analgesia. The stimulating parameters of this current are different from conventional TENS. H-wave therapy is a specialized form of electrical stimulation therapy used in physiotherapy and rehabilitation. It is designed to promote pain relief and functional recovery by mimicking the natural low-frequency signals of the human nervous system. H-wave therapy uses a patented waveform technology that delivers low-frequency, nonfatiguing electrical stimulation to achieve both therapeutic and rehabilitative effects. It aims to improve circulation, reduce inflammation, alleviate pain, and promote tissue healing. H-wave therapy operates through two primary modes such as low frequency and high frequency. Low-frequency stimulation (1–2 Hz), promotes lymphatic drainage and improved microcirculation, reduces edema and inflammation, and facilitates tissue healing by improving oxygen delivery and nutrient flow. High-frequency stimulation (60–70 Hz) provides analgesic effects by targeting pain pathways and inhibits pain transmission by stimulating large sensory nerve fibers (gate control theory). <span class="italic">Therapeutic effects</span> include relief of pain, improved circulation, muscle relaxation, tissue repair and enhanced lymphatic flow. Since it helps manage chronic and acute pain, including neuropathic pain, improved circulation since it enhances blood flow and reduces swelling, muscle relaxation as it reduces spasms and stiffness in muscles, accelerates tissue repair and accelerates recovery in conditions like tendinitis or ligament injuries and enhances lymphatic flow as it can assists in reducing fluid retention and inflammation. H-wave therapy is commonly used for chronic pain syndromes such as arthritis, neuropathy, and fibromyalgia. Acute injuries such as sprains, strains, and postoperative recovery. Peripheral neuropathies including diabetic neuropathy. Soft tissue injuries such as tendinitis, bursitis, and muscle strains, swelling, and edema management.<a name="page110"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">110</span></span></p>

</div><div class="section" id="ch4lev1sec7"><h1 class="title">INTERFERENTIAL CURRENT</h1>
<div class="section" id="ch4lev2sec31"><h2 class="title">Overview</h2>
<p class="noindent">It is the production of low frequency current in the body tissue by the simultaneous application of two different medium frequency currents. As it is obtained as a result of interference of two different medium frequency currents, it is known as interferential current. Alternatively, interferential current can be defined as the resultant current produced in the body tissue when two medium frequency alternating currents are applied simultaneously. This current is produced at the intersection of two medium frequency alternating currents. Historically, in 1950, H Nemac for the first time suggested interferential current for therapeutic application. It is also called Russian current as Dr KM Kots first described its use in 1970, in Russian medical literature. Interferential current can be used for pain relief and acceleration of healing unlike TENS that is used only for pain relief. Present, research databases suggest that interferential current is more effective in chronic pain.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch4lev2sec32"><h2 class="title">Characteristics</h2>
<p class="noindent">Before reading the characteristics, please refer <bold><a href="#ch4fig17" class="ulink-inter">Figure 4.17</a></bold> for the sake of comprehension. Here, we will discuss three fundamental things pertaining to interferential current. (<bold>Mnemonic:</bold> ‘ABC’, where A: area of interference, B: beat frequency and C: current.)</p>
<div class="section" id="ch4lev3sec32"><h3 class="title">Currents</h3>
<p class="noindent">Two medium frequency currents are used to produce the interferential current <bold>(<a href="#ch4fig18" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 4.18</a>)</bold>. They are known as carrier waves as they do not produce muscle nerve stimulation and are just used to get greater depth of penetration and to produce interferential current. Out of two medium frequency currents the frequency of one current is fixed and it is 4,000 Hz. The frequency of the other current lies in between 4,000 and 4,100 Hz, which is adjustable. When these currents cross each other, they will produce a third current at the point where they cross each other, and this third current is known as interferential current.</p>
<div class="figure" id="ch4fig18" data-label="Fig. 4.18"><div class="title"><span class="item-label">Fig. 4.18</span> Interferential current.</div><img alt="Fig. 4.18" src="/MediumImage/110-1.jpg"><div class="additional-markup"></div></div>
<p class=""><a name="page111"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">111</span></span></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch4lev3sec33"><h3 class="title">Beat Frequency</h3>
<p class="noindent">The frequency of the resultant current (third current produced due to crossing) is known as beat frequency. Beat frequency is equal to the difference between two medium frequency currents. It lies between 0 to 100 Hz. Beat frequency may be kept constant or varied rhythmically so as to prevent accommodation.</p>
<p class="noindent"><bold>Constant beat frequency:</bold> It is also called selective beat frequency. Different selective beat frequencies can be selected in between 0 and 100 Hz.</p>
<p class="noindent"><bold>Variable beat frequency:</bold> It is also called automatic beat frequency. Various variable beat frequencies can be used.</p>
<p class="indent">Beat frequency of 0 to 5 hertz stimulate sympathetic nerves, 5 to 10 Hz stimulate parasympathetic nerves, 10 to 50 Hz stimulate motor nerves, 50 to 90 Hz produces sedative and spasmolytic effect, and 90 to 100 Hz produces analgesic or pain relief effect. (<bold>Mnemonic:</bold> ‘SPM’, SP social and preventive medicine's special portion, where S is sympathetic, P is parasympathetic, M is motor nerves, S is spasmolytic, and P is pain relief).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch4lev3sec34"><h3 class="title">Area of Interference</h3>
<p class="noindent">Area of interference is the area where interferential current is set-up. The pattern of the interferential area may be static or dynamic.</p>
<p class="noindent"><bold>Static interference:</bold> Here the area in which interferential current is setup-remains stationary. This area of static interference gives an appearance of a clove leaf <bold>(<a href="#ch4fig19" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 4.19</a>)</bold> as a result of the vector addition of two currents, and it lies to 45° angles to the perpendicular lines from each electrode.</p>
<div class="figure" id="ch4fig19" data-label="Fig. 4.19"><div class="title"><span class="item-label">Fig. 4.19</span> Static interference.</div><img alt="Fig. 4.19" src="/MediumImage/111-1.jpg"><div class="additional-markup"></div></div>
<p class="noindent"><bold>Dynamic area of interference:</bold> It is possible to move the area in which interference current is developed in a to-and-fro manner through 45°. It is obtained by varying the current intensity in suitable manner. Current is varied from 50 to 100%. This dynamic area of interference is also called vector sweep, vector scan, rotating vector, etc.<a name="page112"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">112</span></span></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch4lev2sec33"><h2 class="title">Therapeutic Effects</h2>
<p class="noindent">Therapeutic effects of interferential current include muscle contraction, increased blood flow, relief of spasm and pain relief. (<bold>Mnemonic:</bold> ‘M BSP’, Mayawati's BSP a political party in India, where M: muscle contraction, B: blood flow, S: spasm, P: pain relief).</p>
<div class="section" id="ch4lev3sec35"><h3 class="title">Pain Relief</h3>
<p class="noindent">Interferential current is commonly used for electroanalgesia in various musculoskeletal conditions. Interferential current is effective in cases of chronic pain with or without swelling but it is found to be less effective in post-traumatic pain in acute stage. The exact mechanism of pain relief by interferential current is not known. Pain relief may occur as a result of removal of irritant or pain substances. Interferential current can stimulate autonomic nerves, which results in vasodilation and improved circulation. Improved circulation can remove the waste products or pain substances from the site of application. Alternatively, pain relief may be due to release of endorphins or due to activation of pain gate mechanism. Pain relief may also occur due to stimulation of reticular formation, blocking C fiber transmission and placebo effect.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch4lev3sec36"><h3 class="title">Relief of Muscle Spasm</h3>
<p class="noindent">Spasm is often associated with pain, unnatural movement and muscle strain. Relief of pain helps in breaking pain-spasm–pain cycle and hence interferential therapy can be used for the relief of muscle spasm. Interferential therapy (IFT) is an effective modality in physiotherapy for reducing muscle spasms. It achieves this through the application of medium-frequency electrical currents that intersect within the target tissue, producing therapeutic effects. By reducing pain, it breaks the pain-spasm-pain cycle, which is a major contributor to sustained muscle spasms. The medium-frequency current penetrates deeply into the tissues, inducing rhythmic contractions or gentle stimulation of the muscle. These effects reduce muscle tension and promote relaxation of hypertonic muscles. The gentle contractions and increased local circulation help flush out metabolic waste (e.g., lactic acid), reducing irritants that can perpetuate spasms. Better oxygenation of the muscle aids in restoring normal function. IFT reduces excessive activity in motor nerves, which decreases involuntary muscle contractions (spasms). It promotes balanced nerve signaling, reducing the hyperactivity associated with spastic conditions. It can be used in the treatment of chronic post-traumatic spasms, chronic muscle spasms in conditions like fibromyalgia or myofascial pain syndrome postural muscle tension associated with prolonged sitting or poor ergonomics and spasm in neurological conditions in conditions like spasticity after stroke or multiple sclerosis.<a name="page113"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">113</span></span></p>

<div class="section" id="ch4lev3sec37"><h3 class="title">Stimulation of Innervated Muscles</h3>
<p class="noindent">Interferential current can stimulate deeply situated muscles, as it is like a low-frequency current. Stimulation with a lower beat frequency such as 10 will result in a series of twitches, while stimulation with a higher beat frequency like 50 will result in a titanic contraction. Selection of parameters that can result in combined muscle stimulation with an increase in blood flow can be helpful in the treatment of edema. The beat frequency selectively stimulates motor neurons, leading to controlled muscle contraction. It mimics natural motor nerve activation, promoting functional contraction of the muscle. Further, rhythmic contractions induced by IFT improve blood flow and lymphatic drainage, aiding in reducing swelling and improving muscle tone. IFT is the medium-frequency currents penetrate deeper tissues compared to other electrical stimulation methods. It creates less discomfort due to the sinusoidal waveform of the currents; it can target both small and large muscle groups, sage and effective for long-term use.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch4lev3sec38"><h3 class="title">Effect on Edema</h3>
<p class="noindent">Edema is the collection of fluid in interstitial space. Edema can be associated with swelling. Exudates in edema, may get organized and form adhesions and hence to prevent this, interferential current can be used. Interferential current causes vasodilation increases venous, lymphatic flow, electroporation or increased permeability, and pumping effect through muscle contraction that helps in accelerating physiologic mechanism for the absorption of the exudates along with reduced pain and inflammation. Hence, interferential current is preferred in the treatment of edema associated with traumatic and nontraumatic musculoskeletal conditions.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch4lev3sec39"><h3 class="title">Increased Blood Circulation</h3>
<p class="noindent">The interferential current affects the autonomic nervous system, and an adequate beat frequency selection can cause stimulation of the parasympathetic nervous system and thereby vasodilation and increased blood circulation. The rhythmic muscle contractions induced by low-frequency IFT (e.g., 1–10 Hz) enhance venous return and capillary perfusion. Improved circulation helps remove stagnant fluid and reduces swelling in the affected area. This therapeutic effect is useful in promoting healing and thereby it helps in the restoration of function.<a name="page114"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">114</span></span></p>

<div class="section" id="ch4lev2sec34"><h2 class="title">Electrodes</h2>
<p class="noindent">In electrotherapy, electrodes are the conductors, which are used to allow the easy passage of therapeutic currents to the body. Various types of electrodes used for the application of interferential current include vacuum electrode, pad electrode, carbon impregnated/silicone rubber electrode, four field electrodes, two field double electrodes, quadripolar/four-point probe electrode, labile electrode, etc.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch4lev3sec40"><h3 class="title">Vacuum Electrode</h3>
<p class="noindent">Vacuum electrode is like a rubber bell. Here, the electrode is kept at the base of the bell and wire, or lead is connected at the narrow end. Generally, a soaked sponge or spontex is kept just below the electrode so as to achieve even contact to the skin and hence there is even conduction. These electrodes are held to the patient with negative pressure created by a vacuum pump. The magnitude of the vacuum should be adjusted so that, the least amount of suction is necessary to keep the electrodes on the skin otherwise, superficial bruising may occur. Vacuum electrodes are available in various sizes. Vacuum can be adjusted so as to get constant or pulsed mode. When pulsed mode is used, additional effect of the massage can be obtained. Vacuum electrodes are excellent for treating flat smooth areas, where they can be applied easily and quickly. On bony areas such as shoulder and ankle, it is difficult to place the vacuum cup in correct position without deformation. The deformation squeezes the cup and the area enclosed by the rim is diminished. As a result of deformation, the two electrodes in a particular channel would not be of the same size and the circuit is unbalanced. On hairy skin, it is difficult to get an airtight seal. In elderly patients, the skin is likely to be thin and papery, it presents difficulty with contact and bruises easily. Vacuum electrodes are considered unsafe for patients who are taking steroids, patients who are taking anticoagulation therapy, deep vein thrombosis, history of pulmonary embolism. This is again because of the likelihood of bruising and other complications.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch4lev3sec41"><h3 class="title">Labile Electrodes</h3>
<p class="noindent">Labile electrode is a special type of plate electrode, which is insulated on one side and is covered with sponge to provide contact. Two electrodes are used for the treatment purpose.<a name="page115"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">115</span></span> The operator holds them in position while treating. During the treatment, these electrodes are moved over the patient's skin. Usually, one side of the electrode is insulated, or operator puts on the gloves, so that current does not pass through the operator's hand while applying the current through these electrodes to the patient. Then operator secures them to his palms with Velcro. It is helpful if foot control is available otherwise both the electrodes are first held by one hand while the other hand adjusts the current. Pads are moved in see-saw movement. It is useful in the treatment of muscular conditions and awkward areas.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch4lev2sec35"><h2 class="title">Dosimetry</h2>
<p class="noindent">Interferential therapy can be applied for 10 to 20 minutes and if more than one area is to be treated, then total treatment time should not exceed 30 minutes, since it is believed that lengthy treatment causes tiredness towards the end of the day. Further, it is advised that interferential current treatment can be given for about 10 to 25 days, once a day basis. Usually, the intensity, which produce a strong but comfortable prickling sensations without any discomfort is used. Alternatively, three times toleration (TTT Dose) can be used. Three T dose is used in treating localized condition that is tender and is to be an anesthetized. Place the electrodes, increase the intensity so as to give intense prickling, once the intense prickling sensation is reduced, increase the intensity once again so as to get intense prickling and repeat the same once again so as to treat the area three times with strong prickling.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch4lev2sec36"><h2 class="title">Indications</h2>
<p class="noindent">Interferential therapy <bold>(<a href="#ch4fig20" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 4.20</a>)</bold> is commonly used for the pain relief, relief of muscle spasm, improve the venous and lymphatic drainage, and re-education of deeply situated muscles, which are not easily accessible with low frequency currents. Various conditions in which interferential current may be used are: Osteo- arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, spondylosis, low back pain, frozen shoulder, chondromalacia, stress incontinence, nocturnal incontinence, brachial neuralgia, sciatica, phantom pain, Buerger's disease, Raynaud's disease, myalgia/myositis, edema following immobilization, bronchial asthma, bursitis, tendonitis, etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch4lev2sec37"><h2 class="title">Contraindications and Precautions</h2>
<p class="noindent">Interferential current is contraindicated in patients with cardiac pacemaker, advanced cardiac disease, hypertension, hypotension, thrombosis, recent hemorrhage, pregnancy, neoplasm, tuberculosis, fever, infection and active epiphyseal region.<a name="page116"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">116</span></span></p>
<div class="figure" id="ch4fig20" data-label="Fig. 4.20"><div class="title"><span class="item-label">Fig. 4.20</span> Equipment.</div><img alt="Fig. 4.20" src="/MediumImage/116-1.jpg"><div class="additional-markup"></div></div>
<p class="noindent">It is believed that treatment of arterial diseases with interferential current could produce emboli, in acute phase of deep vein thrombosis, it is possible that thrombi could get dislodged or increase the inflammation of the vein, that is phlebitis. The treatment of an area of infection can cause aggravation of the symptoms, infection could spread, treatment of pelvic region with interferential current is not safe for fetus. Direct stimulation of tumor is contraindicated, but referred pain from tumor or metastasis can be treated with interferential current in hospices. Maintain the suction level below that which causes damage or discomfort to the patient. Interferential apparatus must be kept at least 6 meters away from a short-wave diathermy machine, preferably in another room, otherwise circuit damage can occur, or the patient may experience a sudden surge of current when the short-wave diathermy machine is turned off. To prevent interference from short-wave diathermy a filter circuit can be used in interferential therapy machine.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch4lev2sec38"><h2 class="title">Methods of Application</h2>
<p class="noindent">Interferential current can be applied by means of bipolar, quadripolar (<bold><a href="#ch4fig21" class="ulink-inter">Figure 4.21</a></bold> shows quadripolar placement of electrodes over the shoulder joint area while <bold><a href="#ch4fig22" class="ulink-inter">Figure 4.22</a></bold> presents the same around knee joint area), stereodynamic and labile method. In bipolar method, only two electrodes are used. It is said that in case of bipolar method, medium-frequency currents are added inside the machine (premodulated) to produce low frequency output. This mode of treatment is sometimes known as electrokinesis.<a name="page117"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">117</span></span></p>
<div class="figure" id="ch4fig21" data-label="Fig. 4.21"><div class="title"><span class="item-label">Fig. 4.21</span> Electrodes placement for shoulder joint area.</div><img alt="Fig. 4.21" src="/MediumImage/117-1.jpg"><div class="additional-markup"></div></div>

<p class="noindent">The <span class="italic">disadvantage</span> of bipolar method of application is more sensory stimulation since there is more skin resistance for this output current as compared to classical interferential current and hence it gives unpleasant sensation to the patient. In stereo dynamic systems, three pairs of electrodes are used, and the machine provides three outputs. It reduces accommodation and provides three-dimensional interferential field. In labile method, two labile electrodes are used for the treatment purpose and operator moves them during the treatment. The choice for electrode placement for interferential current application include, area of pain, spinal nerve root, peripheral nerve, trigger point and acupuncture point.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch4lev2sec39"><h2 class="title">Advantages of Interferential Current</h2>
<p class="noindent">Interferential current does not produce any sensorimotor irritation, metal is not contraindicated for interferential therapy and hence number of postoperative conditions can be treated with interferential therapy. Also, interferential current is useful in treating tissues at a greater depth. Owing to the frequency, the skin resistance is very low, and current can be localized more effectively in specific areas. It is cost-effective and offers a nonpharmacological alternative to pain management, reducing reliance on medications and associated costs.</p>

</div><div class="section" id="ch4lev1sec8"><h1 class="title">RUSSIAN CURRENT</h1>
<p class="noindent">Russian current is a medium frequency alternating current with a frequency of 2.5 KHz; burst modulation of 50 Hz with a duty cycle of 50%. Russian forms of electrical stimulation became popular largely as a result of the activities of Dr Yakov Kots, who claimed force gains of up to 40% in elite athletes as a result of what was then a new form of stimulation.<a name="page118"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">118</span></span> The 10/50/10 stimulation protocol suggested is optimal. Whereas the 10/50/10 regimen is in the form of stimulus. 10 sec/on period, 50 sec/off period follows stimulus. Treatment time is 10 minutes and when applied once daily over a period of weeks, it surely increases strength. Dr Yakov Kots argued that increasing a muscle force-generating capability can be achieved by two means: Learning and central nervous system (CNS) adaptation and an increase in the physical bulk of the muscle. Greater maximal volitional contraction is produced by CNS learning and adaptation of the pattern of excitation. In this case, force gains are achieved by greater and more effective recruitment of muscle fibers. An increase in the physical bulk of the muscle produces a greater force output for the same neural input. In this case, the muscle fiber grows in size and muscle volume increases. The increase in limb circumference and thus by inference, muscle bulk parallels the increase in muscle force, so the Russian author concluded that the force gains were predominantly peripheral in origin. Key features of Russian current include medium-frequency sinusoidal current (2500 Hz) that is modulated into bursts, each burst lasts for 10 milliseconds and is followed by a rest interval of 10 milliseconds, producing a 50 Hz burst frequency. Typically, intensity is high enough to induce visible and strong muscle contractions. Medium-frequency currents reduce skin impedance, making it more comfortable for the patient compared to low-frequency currents. Possible mechanism of action includes muscle recruitment, strengthening effect, and neuromuscular re-education. Activates motor neurons to produce strong, synchronized muscle contractions, mimicking voluntary contraction patterns. Enhances recruitment of Type II muscle fibers (fast-twitch), which are crucial for strength and power. Strengthening effect as it promotes muscle hypertrophy and increased force generation by stimulating motor units that may not be fully engaged during voluntary exercises. Neuromuscular re-education as it can assist in retraining muscles, especially after injury, surgery, or disuse atrophy. Physiological effects are muscle strengthening since it induces muscle contractions similar to voluntary contractions, effective in rebuilding muscle strength in weakened or atrophied muscles, reduces pain through the pain gate mechanism, enhances blood flow to the treated area and facilitates neuromuscular re-education and motor control in postsurgical or postinjury conditions. It is indicated in muscle weakness or atrophy (e.g., postsurgery or immobilization), muscle strengthening in athletes, neuromuscular re-education, pain management and in postoperative rehabilitation (e.g., ACL reconstruction).<a name="page119"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">119</span></span> It is contraindicated in cardiac pacemakers or implanted devices, pregnancy (especially over the abdomen or pelvis), open wounds or skin infections, malignant tumors in the treatment area, epilepsy or seizure disorders and thrombophlebitis or risk of embolism. <span class="italic">Advantages</span> of Russian currents are; it is effective for muscle strengthening and re-education, suitable for both rehabilitation and performance enhancement, noninvasive and safe when applied correctly and it can be combined with voluntary exercise for better outcomes. <span class="italic">Limitations</span> are that it requires proper application technique for optimal results, muscle soreness may occur after the session and it is not suitable for completely denervated muscles.</p>
</div><div class="section" id="ch4lev1sec9"><h1 class="title">SINUSOIDAL CURRENT</h1>
<p class="noindent">A sinusoidal current is an evenly alternating, biphasic low frequency current whose waveform resembles the sine curve as in <bold><a href="#ch4fig23" class="ulink-inter">Figure 4.23</a></bold>. Its frequency is 50 to 100 Hz and pulse duration is 10 ms. Sinusoidal current is classified on the basis of frequency as slow sinusoidal and rapid sinusoidal current. The frequency of a slow sinusoidal current is 50 Hz and the rapid sinusoidal current's frequency is 100 Hz. Practically, sinusoidal current resembles Faradic current, both in effects as well as methods of application.</p>
<p class="indent">Parameters for sinusoidal current stimulations include:</p>

</div><div class="section" id="ch4lev1sec10"><h1 class="title">HIGH VOLTAGE PULSED GALVANIC CURRENT</h1>
<p class="noindent">High voltage pulsed galvanic (HVPG) was popularized in 1970s. Here, the current is not truly galvanic. It is monophasic twin-peaked high intensity current as in <bold><a href="#ch4fig24" class="ulink-inter">Figure 4.24</a></bold>. HVPG has pulse duration &lt;20 ms. (You can memorize monophasic twin peaked high intensity pulsed direct current with MTP, HIPDC.) Intensity of 500 volts or 2,500 milliampere is used with this current. Higher intensity of the current overcomes the natural resistance of the skin and hence deeper penetration. The advantages of HVPG are, that it reduces skin resistance, it can penetrate to deeper tissues with minimal discomfort, versatile and effective for a variety of conditions, noninvasive and safe, promotes both symptomatic relief and tissue healing.</p>
<div class="figure" id="ch4fig24" data-label="Fig. 4.24"><div class="title"><span class="item-label">Fig. 4.24</span> High voltage pulsed galvanic current.</div><img alt="Fig. 4.24" src="/MediumImage/120-1.jpg"><div class="additional-markup"></div></div>
<p class="noindent"><a name="page121"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">121</span></span>HVPG has probe electrodes for the treatment and hence it can be used for the treatment of trigger points. Short pulse width improves the patient's comfort and produces polarizing effect. Although it is smaller, it may be beneficial in wound healing. Therapeutic effects include alleviation of pain since it activates the pain gate mechanism, promotes the release of endorphins, edema reduction as the negative polarity can repel negatively charged proteins, reducing edema, acceleration of wound healing since HVPG positive polarity stimulates epithelialization and collagen synthesis, negative polarity attracts macrophages and neutrophils for infection control, enhances local blood flow and nutrient delivery, promotes muscle re-education and reduces muscle spasm. HVPG is often indicated in acute and chronic pain: Postinjury pain, arthritis, or neuropathic pain, edema: Sweling caused by trauma or surgery, wound healing: Chronic ulcers, pressure sores, or diabetic wounds, muscle weakness: Postimmobilization or postsurgical atrophy and circulatory disorders: Peripheral vascular diseases. It is contraindicated in cardiac pacemakers or other implanted electrical devices, pregnancy (especially over the abdomen or pelvis), active infections or malignancies in the treatment area, open wounds (unless specifically for wound healing purposes), and thrombophlebitis or deep vein thrombosis.</p>
</div><div class="section" id="ch4lev1sec11"><h1 class="title">MICRO AMPERAGE ELECTRICAL NERVE STIMULATION</h1>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Micro amperage electrical nerve stimulation (MENS) is a form of electrotherapy current that provides sub-threshold or sub-liminal stimulation</span>. The amplitude of this current is &lt;1 milliampere, which is insufficient to depolarize sensory and motor nerves and hence patients do not experience either tingling sensation or muscle contractions. The MENS work on Arndt Schultz's law. According to this law, weak stimuli increase physiologic activity and very strong stimuli, inhibits or abolishes activity. It is believed that MENS increases cell permeability, intracellular concentration of calcium ions, fibroblast activity and protein synthesis. Pain relief by MENS may occur due to reduction in the liberation of pain-producing substances at cellular level. For pain relief, MENS can be applied for ten minutes initially with positive polarity and later on by negative polarity.<a name="page122"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">122</span></span></p>
<p class="indent">Physiological effects of micro amperage current/microcurrent therapy/microcurrents are that they stimulate adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production, enhance cellular metabolism and energy for tissue healing, increase protein synthesis and collagen formation, modulate pain through the stimulation of endorphin release and the pain gate mechanism, decrease inflammatory cytokines and promotes lymphatic drainage and enhances local blood flow, facilitating nutrient and oxygen delivery. It is indicated in acute and chronic pain (e.g., musculoskeletal pain, fibromyalgia), wound healing (e.g., pressure sores, ulcers, postsurgical wounds), soft tissue injuries (e.g., sprains, strains, tendinitis), edema and swelling and neuropathic pain or peripheral nerve injuries.

<div class="sidebar"><h2 class="title">Summary</h2>
<p class="">Muscle nerve stimulating currents are used primarily for muscle re- education, pain relief and to delay atrophy and wasting of muscle. Various currents included in this category are direct current, Faradic current, interrupted direct current, TENS, interferential current, sinusoidal current, diadynamic current, high voltage pulsed galvanic current (HVPG). Direct current is unidirectional continuous current. Faradic current is primarily used to produce contraction of normally innervated muscles and current usually surged so as to get contractions that resembles voluntary contractions.</p>
<p class="indent">Interrupted direct current is commonly used for stimulation of denervated muscles and for electrodiagnostic purpose. TENS is used mainly for pain relief, and it is believed that the body tissues may get accommodated to TENS current and hence to prevent this, TENS current is modulated. Interferential current is the production of low frequency current in the body tissue by the simultaneous application of two different medium frequency currents. Practically sinusoidal current resembles Faradic current both in effects as well as methods of application. It is now clear that HVPG is monophasic twin-peaked high intensity current with pulse duration &lt;20 microsecond. Diadynamic currents are also called Bernard currents.</p>
