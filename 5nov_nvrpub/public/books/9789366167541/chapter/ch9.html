<p class="noindent">The history of phototherapy (the use of light for therapeutic purposes) spans centuries and combines ancient practices with modern medical innovations. Egyptians used sunlight to treat skin conditions. Greeks introduced the term “<bold>heliotherapy</bold>” (sun therapy), with Hippocrates advocating sunlight for health. Romans constructed solariums (sunrooms) for health purposes. In India, sunlight therapy was part of Ayurveda, often combined with herbal treatments for skin disorders. Chinese medicine utilizes sunlight and heat for health.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">During the medieval period</span>, interest in heliotherapy waned during this era as medical practices became more rooted in superstition and religion. Some continued to use sunlight for health benefits, but it was not systematically studied.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">During the renaissance</span>, scientific exploration revived interest in light and its effects on the body. Physicians began exploring sunlight for treating diseases like rickets and tuberculosis.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">In the late 19th century</span>, the understanding of the light spectrum, including ultraviolet (UV) light, laid the groundwork for modern phototherapy. <bold>Niels Ryberg Finsen (1893)</bold> known as the <bold>“Father of Modern Phototherapy</bold>,” Finsen demonstrated that concentrated light could treat diseases and won the Nobel Prize in Medicine (1903) for using UV light to treat lupus vulgaris (a skin manifestation of tuberculosis).<a name="page228"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">228</span></span></p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">In the early 20th century</span>, heliotherapy gained popularity and heliotherapy clinics were established in Europe and the US, particularly for tuberculosis and skin diseases. Sunlight exposure was used to treat rickets, later identified as caused by vitamin D deficiency. Artificial light sources like electric arc lamps and mercury vapor lamps were developed to mimic sunlight and deliver therapeutic light. UV lamps have become widely used in treating skin conditions like psoriasis.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">In the 20th century</span>, phototherapy became a primary treatment for psoriasis, eczema, and vitiligo. Narrowband UVB and PUVA (psoralen + UVA) therapies were developed for precision treatment. Slowly, phototherapy emerged as a groundbreaking treatment for neonatal jaundice. Blue light was found effective in breaking down bilirubin in newborns, preventing severe complications. The invention of lasers allowed for highly focused phototherapy applications, including skin resurfacing and removal of vascular lesions.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">In 21st century</span>, light-emitting diode (LED) technology introduced low-level light therapy (LLLT) for skin rejuvenation, pain relief, and wound healing. Red, blue, and near-infrared light are widely used for anti-aging and acne treatment. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) uses light to activate photosensitizing drugs that target cancer cells. Bright light therapy emerged as a treatment for depression associated with seasonal affective disorder.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Nowadays</span>, wearable, compact, portable, and home phototherapy devices allow individuals to manage skin conditions or seasonal depression at home.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">Phototherapy has evolved from sunlight-based healing to precise, science-driven techniques. It continues to be a critical tool in medicine, with ongoing research exploring new wavelengths and applications for improved health outcomes.</p>
<p class="noindent"><bold>Applications of phototherapy</bold> include:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Orthopedics</span> for pain management</p></li>

</div><div class="section" id="ch9lev1sec2"><h1 class="title">THERAPEUTIC LASER</h1>
<p class="noindent"><bold>LASER</bold> is an acronym for <span class="italic">light amplification by the stimulated emission of radiation</span>. In simple words, laser is a beam of radiation, which is used for various purposes. Lasers are termed as <bold>magic rays</bold> since; they have enormous applications in different fields. For physiotherapeutic purpose, therapeutic laser is used. Therapeutic laser is also known as low intensity laser, soft laser, cold laser, medical laser, and class 3A and 3B laser.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch9lev2sec1"><h2 class="title">Historical Aspects</h2>
<p class="noindent">Historically, Einstein was the first person who gave an account of stimulated emission.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">In 1953</span>, <bold>MASER</bold> (microwave amplification by stimulated emission of radiation) was discovered.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">In 1955</span>, Dr Theodore Maiman devised a working model for the production of laser from ruby crystal.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">In 1960</span>, Bennett, Javan and Herriott discovered Helium-Neon laser.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">In 1962</span>, White and Ridgen produced visible red laser with 632.8 nm wavelength.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">In 1964</span>, Flock and Zueng for the first time used laser for surgery.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">From 1980 onwards</span>, therapeutic laser is used for physiotherapeutic applications.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch9lev2sec2"><h2 class="title">Characteristics</h2>
<p class="noindent">Laser has unique characteristics, which differentiate it from other forms of light. Various characteristic features of laser are monochromaticity, coherence and collimation. (<bold>Mnemonic: ‘CMC’</bold> where C: coherence, M: monochromaticity and C: collimation).</p>
<div class="section" id="ch9lev3sec1"><h3 class="title">Monochromaticity</h3>
<p class="noindent">Here, the word mono means single, and chromaticity means color. On its emission, laser produces single pure color. It produces single pure color because, it has one specific wavelength. Laser light entering a prism would be identical on exit because it is monochromatic. On the other hand, white light is made up of many different colors or wavelengths and when it passes through a prism, it produces a rainbow of colors.<a name="page230"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">230</span></span></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch9lev3sec2"><h3 class="title">Coherence</h3>
<p class="noindent">Laser rays are synchronous to each other. This property of synchronicity is termed as <bold>coherence</bold>. Crest and trough of individual rays match each other. Laser rays are synchronous to each other in space, i.e., they travel in the same direction and this coherence is known as <bold>spatial coherence</bold>. Laser rays are also coherent to each other in relation to time and this type of coherence is known as <bold>temporal coherence</bold>. Analogy about the coherence can be done with army soldiers when they are marching in step in the same direction and wearing the same dress.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch9lev3sec3"><h3 class="title">Collimation</h3>
<p class="noindent">Collimation is also termed as <bold>nondivergence</bold>. Laser rays travel parallel to each other rather than diverging from each other, this property is known as <bold>collimation</bold>. Collimation does not occur in other forms of light for example, bulb and battery. In case of bulb and battery, the rays divert since they consist of many different wavelengths, and they spread out in all directions. If sunlight is called crowd scattering after explosion of tear gas, then laser light can be called disciplined military drill. It is said that the laser rays can travel up to the moon from earth in parallel to each other, with very negligible divergence.</p>

<div class="section" id="ch9lev2sec3"><h2 class="title">Classification of Lasers</h2>
<p class="noindent">Lasers can be classified based on intensity, risk of eye injury, and source and medium.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch9lev3sec4"><h3 class="title">Based on Intensity</h3>
<p class="noindent">Lasers can be roughly classified into two types namely, <bold>cold laser</bold> and <bold>hot laser</bold>.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Cold laser</span> is also known as <span class="italic">low intensity laser</span> or <span class="italic">therapeutic laser</span>. The average power of cold laser is &lt;60 mW. This power is below the power which causes tissue heating.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Hot laser</span> is also known as <span class="italic">high intensity laser</span> or <span class="italic">surgical laser</span>. Here the average power is above the power which causes tissue heating. The power of hot laser is &gt;60 mW.</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch9lev3sec5"><h3 class="title">Based on Risk of Eye Injury</h3>
<p class="noindent">Lasers are often classified into five categories as classes 1, 2, 3A, 3B and 4 based on their potential to damage the eye as follows in <bold><a href="#ch9tbl1" class="ulink-inter">Table 9.1</a></bold>.<a name="page231"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">231</span></span></p>

<div class="section" id="ch9lev3sec8"><h3 class="title">Functional Parts</h3>
<p class="noindent">A laser device consists of three chief components such as lasing medium, energy source and mechanical structure (<bold>Mnemonic:</bold> MEL and not MEL GIBSON).</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Lasing medium:</bold> It is a material which can produce lasers. It may be gaseous, liquid, solid crystal or semiconductor.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Energy source:</bold> An energy source is used to excite the lasing medium. This excitation is usually electrical. It is also known as <bold>flashgun</bold>.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Mechanical structure:</bold> It is a central chamber-like structure, which contains the lasing medium. It has two mirrors at either end. Out of these two mirrors, one is for reflection of photons of light back and across the chamber. Other mirror in addition to reflection, serves as an exit for the output of photons of light or laser <bold>(<a href="#ch9fig1" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 9.1</a>)</bold>.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch9lev3sec9"><h3 class="title">Working</h3>
<p class="noindent">When an energy particle or a photon is applied to the atom of lasing medium, it may be absorbed or reflected. When the atom absorbs it then, there is a change in its electron configuration. An electron may jump from lower energy level to higher energy level. An atom with change in its electronic configuration is termed as an excited atom. Atom cannot remain in an excited state for long time and tries to seek its original or ground state. To achieve its ground status, atom emits back the absorbed energy. It is emitted spontaneously and termed as spontaneous emission. If spontaneous emission is allowed to take place, then, laser rays will not be emitted because the energy level necessary to achieve this may not be obtained. Hence, when the atom is in its excited state, then an additional energy is applied so that the atom emits its excess of energy immediately. This emission is known as stimulated emission. Since the emitted energy is more than what is supplied it is known as amplification. Excess of energy is emitted in the form of photons of light.</p>
<div class="figure" id="ch9fig1" data-label="Fig. 9.1"><div class="title"><span class="item-label">Fig. 9.1</span> Functional parts of therapeutic laser device.</div><img alt="Fig. 9.1" src="/MediumImage/233-1.jpg"><div class="additional-markup"></div></div>
<p class="noindent"><a name="page234"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">234</span></span>When these photons are emitted, they are likely to be collected inside the mechanical chamber and when they move from one place to another, they may hit one of the mirrors. When they hit the mirror, they are reflected. Once they are reflected, they travel further through the lasing medium and increase the amplification process further. As a result, more and more photons are accumulated in the mechanical chamber. When the number of photons is more than what can be accommodated in the mechanical chamber, they are then emitted out of the semipermeable mirror or the mirror that has an exit. The emitted photons are in the form of laser. They are carried by fiber optic cable to the probe for treatment purpose.</p>
</div>

<div class="section" id="ch9lev2sec6"><h2 class="title">Effects of Laser</h2>
<div class="section" id="ch9lev3sec10"><h3 class="title">Pain Relief</h3>
<p class="noindent">Laser has got an analgesic effect. It can be used in the treatment of acute as well as chronic musculoskeletal pain. Exactly, how it brings pain relief is not known. It may be as a result of endorphin secretion or due to reduced serotonin level or as per the gate control theory. Laser can be applied at trigger points, acupuncture points or at the site of pain. Personally, I never came across any patient who immediately felt pain relief with laser, but my patients always told me that they felt pain relief after a few hours. It may suggest that unlike few other electrotherapy modalities, therapeutic laser takes some time to exhibit this effect. However, it may be confirmed in future through research. Usually, 8 to 12 treatment sessions may be required for the satisfactory pain relief, but if there is no satisfactory pain relief then, laser treatment can be stopped, and any other alternative may be thought of for pain relief.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch9lev3sec11"><h3 class="title">Tissue Healing</h3>
<p class="noindent">It is said that laser accelerates wounds and ulcers healing. It may be due to increased phagocytosis, facilitation of collagen synthesis, increased wound closure and wound contracture following irradiation with laser. Cummings (1985) performed experiments on rats and treated the artificial wounds in rats with daily laser, alternate laser and sham laser. He found that there was greater healing in those rats, that were treated with alternate day laser application than daily or sham laser. Cummings experiment may suggest that therapeutic laser can accelerate wounds and ulcer healing. There are various explanations or theories to explain the therapeutic laser's efficiency in the treatment of wounds and ulcer healing.<a name="page235"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">235</span></span></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Biostimulation theory:</bold> Lasers stimulate all kinds of biological functions including biochemical, physiological and proliferative activities. It assists in proliferation of fibroblasts, re-epithelization and remodeling. Laser also stimulates intracellular components such as mitochondria, DNA, RNA and other substances, which are vital for growth and repair.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Photochemical theory:</bold> Chromophores are enzymes or membrane molecules. They are photo acceptors, i.e., they absorb different lights like laser. When the laser is absorbed by chromophores, they get excited and exert bio-stimulative effects as above.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch9lev2sec7"><h2 class="title">Indications</h2>
<p class="noindent">In physiotherapy, laser is used mainly for pain relief and for the acceleration of wound healing. Therapeutic laser is used in many musculoskeletal conditions for pain relief. Various conditions in which laser can be used for this purpose are, chronic low back pain, neck pain, shoulder pain (e.g., frozen shoulder), osteoarthritis-related pain (e.g., knee osteoarthritis), diabetic neuropathy, carpal tunnel syndrome, sciatica, pain following orthopedic surgeries or joint replacements, diabetic ulcers, pressure sores, wounds, chronic ulcers, indolent wounds and ulcer, incisions <bold>(<a href="#ch9fig2" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 9.2</a>)</bold> postsurgical incisions, sprains (e.g., ankle sprains), tendonitis (e.g., Achilles tendonitis, tennis elbow), rotator cuff injuries, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, shoulder bursitis, adhesive capsulitis (frozen shoulder), plantar fasciitis, bell's palsy, radial or ulnar nerve injuries, postherpetic neuralgia, strains or tears, delayed-onset muscle soreness (DOMS), post-traumatic synovitis, meniscal injuries, shin splints, golfer's elbow, fibromyalgia, chronic muscle fatigue, myofascial trigger points.</p>

<p class="noindent">Therapeutic laser is contraindicated in pregnancy, especially its application around pelvis. It should not be applied at the site of tumors. Exposure to eyes with therapeutic laser is contraindicated as it may lead to opacity of lens <bold>(<a href="#ch9fig3" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 9.3</a>)</bold>. It should not be applied in an area of hemorrhage, cardiac pacemaker, thrombosis and unclosed fontanels of children, etc. (<bold>Mnemonic:</bold> ‘<bold>PHEN, CTC’</bold> where P: pregnancy, H: hemorrhage, E: eyes, N: neoplasm or tumor, C: cardiac pacemaker, T: thrombosis and C: children).</p>

<p class="noindent">Therapeutic laser can be applied for 2 to 30 seconds. Few manufacturers even suggest the application of laser up to 10 to 12 minutes. So, it will be wise to calculate the dosages or follow the guidelines of the manufacturer in this aspect to get satisfactory results.</p>
<p class="indent">Alternatively, one can apply a dose of 1 to 12 J/cm<sup>2</sup> by using the formula.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="inlinemediaobject"><img alt="" src="/MediumImage/236-1.jpg"></span></p>

<div class="section" id="ch9lev2sec13"><h2 class="title">Production</h2>
<p class="noindent">Any body with high temperature than the surrounding can emit infrared rays and hence, sun is mainly the natural source of infrared radiation. However, in physiotherapy, various types of artificial infrared generators are used, for practical purposes. These generators can be divided into two types namely, nonluminous and luminous.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch9lev3sec12"><h3 class="title">Nonluminous Generators</h3>
<p class="noindent">Nonluminous generators are also called <bold>low temperature generators</bold>. These generators produce only infrared rays and hence, they are not visible. These generators are heated by the passage of electric current through a bare wire or carbon, held in a suitable nonconducting material like porcelain, mounted at the center of a parabolic reflector. Small nonluminous units draw 50 to 300 watts of power and larger ones draw up to 1,500 watts. These generators emit only infrared rays. All nonluminous generators emit infrared rays in between 750 to 15,000 nm. The maximum emission of the rays is around 4,000 nm.<a name="page240"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">240</span></span></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch9lev3sec13"><h3 class="title">Luminous Generators</h3>
<p class="noindent">Luminous generators <bold>(<a href="#ch9fig7" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 9.7</a>)</bold> are also called <bold>high temperature generators</bold>. Luminous generators emit visible rays, ultraviolet rays and infrared rays and hence, they are visible. These generators are in the form of incandescent bulbs. An incandescent bulb consists of a wire filament enclosed in a glass bulb, which may or may not contain inert gas at low pressure. The filament is a coil of fine wires usually made of tungsten. This material tolerates repeated heating and cooling. The exclusion of air prevents the oxidation of filament, which would cause an opaque deposit to form inside the bulb. The wattage of the bulb may vary from 60 to 1,000 watts, though the use of bulbs with higher wattage is discouraged because of the danger of explosion during the treatment. Incandescent bulb is generally mounted at the center of the parabolic reflector and the reflector is mounted on an adjustable stand. All luminous generators emit electromagnetic waves with the wavelength in between 350 to 4,000 nm, but the maximum emission of the rays is around 1,000 nm. Accessories such as localizers, filters to filter out ultraviolet rays and visible rays were used commonly in the past. However, nowadays, only one accessory in the form of variable resistance may be used so as to control the intensity of infrared rays.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch9lev2sec14"><h2 class="title">Depth of Penetration</h2>
<p class="noindent">Maximum effective penetration of infrared rays is three centimeter, however, it may vary from 0.1 millimeter to a few centimeter. It is said that infrared rays from nonluminous generators have less depth of penetration as compared to that of luminous generators.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch9lev2sec15"><h2 class="title">Laws Regulating the Absorption of Radiation</h2>
<p class="noindent">Various laws regulating the absorption of radiations including infrared rays are Grothus law, law of inverse square, cosine law, Beer-Lambert law, Kirchhoff's law, Wien's law, Stefan-Boltzmann law and Arndt-Schultz principle.</p>
<div class="figure" id="ch9fig7" data-label="Fig. 9.7"><div class="title"><span class="item-label">Fig. 9.7</span> Luminous generator.</div><img alt="Fig. 9.7" src="/MediumImage/240-1.jpg"><div class="additional-markup"></div></div>

<div class="section" id="ch9lev3sec14"><h3 class="title">Grothus Law</h3>
<p class="noindent">Grothus law is also known as Grothus-Draper law. <span class="italic">It states that</span>, <span class="italic">the rays must be absorbed to produce the effect, and the effect will be produced at the point at which the rays are absorbed</span>. This law can be explained to the students with a very simple analogy. To mention, you will pass the exam provided you will study, and you will pass those subjects which you study. In another words, to pass you should study, but by studying electrotherapy, you will pass only in electrotherapy and not in any other subject. Although, this is not a perfect analogy, it helps in explaining the law to the students. Infrared therapy relies on the principle that only absorbed radiation induces therapeutic effects. The Grothus-Draper law highlights the importance of selecting the correct IR wavelength and intensity for effective treatment. Understanding this law ensures the precise and safe application of infrared therapy in physiotherapy practices.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch9lev3sec15"><h3 class="title">Law of Inverse Square</h3>
<p class="noindent">Law of inverse square explains the effect of distance on the intensity of infrared rays. <span class="italic">It states that,</span> <span class="italic">the intensity of a beam of rays, from a point source, is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the source</span>. Limitations of this law are that the law assumes a point source of radiation, but many infrared devices have larger emitters, leading to deviations from the idealized model and biological tissues scatter and absorb IR rays, which affects how intensity changes with distance in real-world applications. However, the key takeaway message with this law is, that closer source, higher intensity, more heat, farther source, lower intensity, gentler effect. The inverse square law ensures precision in delivering the right amount of infrared radiation for effective and safe physiotherapy treatments.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch9lev3sec16"><h3 class="title">Cosine Law</h3>
<p class="noindent">Cosine law is also known as <bold>Lambert's Cosine law</bold>. Cosine law explains the effect of angle at which the rays strike. <span class="italic">It states that,</span> <span class="italic">the proportion of rays absorbed varies as per the cosine of the angle between incident and normal.</span> Thus, larger the angle at which the rays strike to the body surface, lesser will be the absorption and vice versa. If the rays strike at 90° to the body part then angle between the incident and normal or perpendicular will be zero and the cosine of 0° is maximum, that is one. Thus, there will be maximum absorption, if the rays will strike the body part at 90° as per this law. Hence, we always try to apply the infrared rays in such a way that they strike at the 90° angles to the body part to be treated.<a name="page242"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">242</span></span></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch9lev3sec17"><h3 class="title">Beer-Lambert Law</h3>
<p class="noindent">The Beer-Lambert law is a principle of spectroscopy that explains how light, including infrared rays, is absorbed as it passes through a medium. In physiotherapy, this law helps to understand and optimize the application of infrared light therapy for therapeutic purposes. <span class="italic">This law states that</span><span class="italic">, the degree of absorption depends on the wavelengths of radiation and nature of the absorbing material.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch9lev3sec18"><h3 class="title">Kirchhoff's Law</h3>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Kirchhoff's law states that</span> <span class="italic">good radiators are good absorbers</span>. Kirchhoff's law explains why infrared-emitting devices (e.g., heaters) and infrared-absorbing materials are designed the way they are. It is fundamental in understanding heat transfer via radiation in any system that involves infrared waves. Practical applications of this law include the black coating that is used in infrared therapy devices to enhance radiation emission and absorption efficiency and shiny or reflective surfaces with low emissivity are avoided in therapeutic contexts since they are poor emitters and absorbers of infrared radiation. Limitations of this law includes that Kirchhoff's law assumes thermal equilibrium, which may not always apply in dynamic biological systems during infrared therapy and real-world materials rarely behave as perfect absorbers or emitters, requiring adjustments in device designs.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch9lev3sec19"><h3 class="title">Wien's Law</h3>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Wien's law states that</span> <span class="italic">the wavelength of maximal emission is inversely proportional to the absolute temperature of the source, so that hotter the source, shorter is the wavelength of emitted rays</span>. Wien's law applies strictly to ideal black bodies, while real-world materials and tissues may deviate slightly due to their emissivity. It does not account for scattering or absorption variations within biological tissues. Wien's law relates the temperature of an object to the wavelength of maximum emission, helping in the design of infrared devices. In physiotherapy, it ensures that devices operate at optimal temperatures to emit radiation within the therapeutic infrared range. It supports effective and safe applications of infrared therapy for pain relief, circulation improvement, and tissue healing.<a name="page243"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">243</span></span></p>

<div class="section" id="ch9lev3sec20"><h3 class="title">Stefan-Boltzmann Law</h3>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Stefan-Boltzmann law states that</span> <span class="italic">the output of the infrared lamp will depend on the temperature of the element and its radiating area</span>. The Stefan-Boltzmann law helps quantify the total energy radiated by a body based on its temperature. In infrared therapy, this law guides the design and use of devices by linking temperature with the amount of radiated energy. By controlling the temperature of infrared lamps, therapists can ensure appropriate energy levels for therapeutic heating without causing harm.</p>

<div class="section" id="ch9lev3sec21"><h3 class="title">Arndt-Schultz Principle</h3>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Arndt-Schultz principle states three things</span>.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p class="">Addition of a sub-threshold quantity of energy will not cause a demonstrable change,</p></li>
<li><p class="">Addition of threshold and above quantity of energy will stimulate the absorbing tissue to normal function and</p></li>

<div class="section" id="ch9lev2sec16"><h2 class="title">Physiological Effects</h2>
<p class="noindent">When infrared rays are applied to the body, they are absorbed by it. As a result of absorption of infrared rays, the electromagnetic energy is converted into the thermal energy and thus heat is produced. The principle physiological effect of the infrared rays on the body is heat production. An infrared ray applicator is shown in <bold><a href="#ch9fig8" class="ulink-inter">Figure 9.8</a></bold>. Other physiological effects occur as a result of heat production. Various physiological effects of infrared rays are local rise in temperature, increased activity of sweat glands, increased metabolism, vasodilation and relaxation of muscle tissue. On extensive or the general treatment of the entire body, there is general rise in body temperature and fall in blood pressure.</p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="ch9lev2sec17"><h2 class="title">Therapeutic Effects</h2>
<p class="noindent">The different therapeutic effects of infrared rays are pain relief, muscle relaxation and increased blood supply. The analgesic effect of infrared rays is not well understood. Mild heating with infrared rays may cause pain relief due to sedation. But strong heating may cause irritation and relieve pain by counter-irritation. Pain relief may occur due to relaxation of muscle spasm. Infrared rays can relieve the muscle spasm due to decreased firing of gamma spindles within the muscle. Pain relief may also occur due to removal of pain substance as a result of increased blood supply and vasodilation, if pain is associated with the accumulation of waste products.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch9lev2sec18"><h2 class="title">Uses</h2>
<p class="noindent">Infrared rays are commonly used in the treatment of subacute and chronic inflammatory conditions, in areas which are accessible to exposure. Various forms of arthritis such as, osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis where joints are painful and the pressure by other modalities like hot packs, etc., on it, must be avoided, then infrared rays can be a treatment of choice. Skin conditions such as furunculosis, folliculitis, etc., can be treated with infrared rays. Infrared rays can be used as a preliminary modality before stretching exercises. It can also be used in the treatment of Bell's palsy for the relief of pain at the root of ear. Infrared rays’ application in Bell's palsy may also be of a value since it may produce perspiration which will reduce the skin resistance and facilitate electrical stimulation of facial muscles. Muscle spasm of traumatic and nontraumatic orthopedic origin can also be very well treated with infrared rays.</p>

<div class="section" id="ch9lev2sec20"><h2 class="title">Dosages of Infrared Rays</h2>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">For acute cases</span>, irradiation with infrared rays can be given for 10 to 15 minutes daily, for one to three times as per the requirement. <span class="italic">For chronic cases</span>, up to 30 minutes once daily or on alternate days can be given. The infrared generator is arranged in such a position so that, it is opposite to the center of the area to be treated and the rays strike at right angles.

</div>
</div><div class="section" id="ch9lev1sec4"><h1 class="title">ULTRAVIOLET RAYS</h1>
<p class="noindent">Ultraviolet rays are invisible rays with wavelengths between 10 to 400 nm. Ultraviolet rays are of three types of namely ultraviolet A, B and C. Although, ultraviolet rays are emitted by the sun, for physiotherapeutic treatment ultraviolet generators <bold>(<a href="#ch9fig9" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 9.9</a>)</bold> produce them. Most of these generators produce ultraviolet rays from mercury. Various generators such as high-pressure mercury vapor lamp, low-pressure mercury vapor lamp, fluorescent tubes, Kromayer lamp, PUVA box, theraktin tunnel, etc., can be used for physiotherapeutic applications.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch9lev2sec22"><h2 class="title">Physiological Effects</h2>
<p class="noindent">Ultraviolet rays can produce localized and generalized physiological effects. Various physiological effects of ultraviolet rays are erythema reaction, thickening of the epidermis, desquamation, pigmentation, esophylactic effect, antibiotic effect, vitamin D formation and general tonic effect.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch9lev3sec22"><h3 class="title">Erythema Reaction</h3>
<p class="noindent">Absorption of ultraviolet rays produces erythema reaction characterized by redness of the skin. This erythema is produced mainly because of ultraviolet rays with wavelengths in between 250 to 297 nm. The severity of erythema depends on the intensity of chemical reaction produced by ultraviolet rays. Intensity of reaction is higher, if the duration of exposure is higher and the distance between the ultraviolet ray source and the body tissue is lesser. If the intensity of irradiation with ultraviolet rays is less, then it may not produce visible red color of the skin.</p>
<div class="figure" id="ch9fig9" data-label="Fig. 9.9"><div class="title"><span class="item-label">Fig. 9.9</span> Ultraviolet ray applicator.</div><img alt="Fig. 9.9" src="/MediumImage/247-1.jpg"><div class="additional-markup"></div></div>
<p class="noindent"><a name="page248"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">248</span></span>Erythema occurrence is mediated through chemical changes. These chemical changes are likely to occur due to release of H substance as a result of irradiation. Release of H substance produces triple response. Triple response is characterized by dilation of capillaries, dilation of arteries and exudation. These changes are similar to inflammation and hence, erythema can be termed as inflammatory reaction. Erythema reaction occurs after 12 hours of irradiation. Depending upon the severity of chemical reaction and cessation time, erythema is divided into four degrees.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p class=""><bold>First degree erythema (E1):</bold> It is characterized by slight reddening of the skin with no irritation or soreness. It subsides in 24 hours.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Second degree erythema (E2):</bold> It is characterized by more reddening of the skin with slight irritation. It subsides in 2 or 3 days.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Third degree erythema (E3):</bold> There is obvious reddening of the skin, which is hot, sore and edematous. The reaction lasts for about a week.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Fourth degree erythema (E4):</bold> Here, all the third-degree erythema changes are present, but in addition to this there is blister formation.</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch9lev3sec23"><h3 class="title">Thickening of the Epidermis</h3>
<p class="noindent">Ultraviolet rays cause damage to the superficial cells. It is followed by increased production of these cells, which tend to cause the thickening of the epidermis. UVB rays penetrate the skin and damage the DNA of keratinocytes in the basal layer of the epidermis. This triggers a repair mechanism and stimulates increased cell division. To protect deeper layers, the basal keratinocytes proliferate more rapidly. This increases the thickness of the epidermis, particularly the stratum corneum (outermost layer). Over time, repeated exposure leads to the accumulation of keratin in the stratum corneum. This thickened layer reduces the penetration of subsequent UV radiation, acting as a protective barrier.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch9lev3sec24"><h3 class="title">Desquamation</h3>
<p class="noindent">Desquamation is the casting of dead cells from the surface of the body. Ultraviolet rays cause damage to the cells. These damaged cells are cast off and the process by which the dead cells are cast off is known as peeling. UV rays, particularly UVB, penetrate the epidermis and cause direct DNA damage to keratinocytes. This damage can trigger apoptosis (programmed cell death) in severely affected cells.<a name="page249"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">249</span></span> Damaged keratinocytes release pro-inflammatory cytokines, leading to redness (erythema), swelling, and pain (commonly seen in sunburn). Damaged skin cells lose their ability to adhere to one another in the stratum corneum. This loss of cohesion leads to the peeling of the superficial layer of dead or dying skin cells. The basal layer of the epidermis compensates for the damage by increasing cell proliferation. This pushes newer cells to the surface more rapidly, contributing to the shedding of the damaged outer layers.</p>

<div class="section" id="ch9lev3sec25"><h3 class="title">Pigmentation</h3>
<p class="noindent">Ultraviolet rays may cause conversion of the amino acid tyrosine into the pigment melanin. The extent of pigmentation varies as per the individual; it is more in those with dark skin than with fair skin. UV rays, especially UVB, penetrate the epidermis and cause DNA damage in skin cells (keratinocytes). This damage triggers a response in melanocytes (pigment-producing cells) to produce melanin as a protective mechanism. Melanocytes synthesize melanin through the action of the enzyme <bold>tyrosinase</bold> in melanosomes. Melanin is transferred to keratinocytes to shield their nuclei from further DNA damage by absorbing and dissipating UV radiation. Immediate pigment darkening occurs within minutes of UV exposure, mainly due to the oxidation of existing melanin and fades within a few hours to days. Persistent pigmentation darkening is caused by UVA exposure and involves a longer-lasting darkening of existing melanin. Delayed tanning develops 2–3 days after UVB exposure and involves increased melanin production and lasts for weeks or months.</p>

<div class="section" id="ch9lev3sec26"><h3 class="title">Esophylactic Effect</h3>
<p class="noindent">Esophylactic effect is the increased body's resistance to infection as a result of ultraviolet rays’ action on reticuloendothelial system. Some reticuloendothelial cells are situated in the superficial tissues. Ultraviolet rays can affect superficially situated reticuloendothelial cells and reduce the irritability threshold of these cells, so that antibodies are produced more readily in response to bacteria and their toxins.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch9lev3sec27"><h3 class="title">Bactericidal Effect</h3>
<p class="noindent">Short ultraviolet rays can destroy bacteria and other microorganisms commonly found in wounds. Fourth degree erythema (E4) dose can effectively destroy all such organisms found in wounds. UV rays, particularly UVC radiation (wavelengths 200–280 nm), are highly effective at destroying microorganisms. UVC damages microbial DNA or RNA by inducing the formation of pyrimidine dimers, primarily thymine dimers.<a name="page250"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">250</span></span> These dimers disrupt the DNA structure and interfere with DNA replication and transcription, leading to cell death. UV exposure generates reactive oxygen species (ROS), which further damage cellular components, including membranes and proteins. If the damage is extensive and the repair mechanisms are overwhelmed, the microorganism becomes nonviable and dies.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch9lev3sec28"><h3 class="title">Vitamin D Formation</h3>
<p class="noindent">Ultraviolet rays may cause conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol (DHC) into vitamin D. This 7-DHC is present in sebum and hence, this reaction may occur at the surface of the skin or in superficial layers of the skin. UVB rays (wavelength 290–315 nm) from sunlight penetrate the epidermis of the skin, primarily affecting the stratum basale and stratum spinosum layers. Within the skin, a molecule called 7-dehydrocholesterol (a cholesterol precursor) absorbs UVB radiation. This triggers a photochemical reaction that converts 7-dehydrocholesterol into previtamin D3. Previtamin D3 undergoes a heat-dependent transformation in the skin, becoming cholecalciferol (vitamin D<sub>3</sub>). Vitamin D<sub>3</sub> enters the bloodstream and is transported to the liver. In the liver, it is hydroxylated by the enzyme 25-hydroxylase to form 25-hydroxyvitamin D (calcidiol), the major circulating form of vitamin D. Calcidiol is further hydroxylated in the kidneys by 1 α-hydroxylase to produce the active form of vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (calcitriol). Role of active vitamin D (calcitriol) it that it regulates calcium and phosphate absorption in the gut, promotes bone mineralization and remodeling, modulates immune function, contributes to the regulation of cell growth. While UVB exposure is necessary for vitamin D production, excessive exposure can increase the risk of skin damage, photoaging, and skin cancer. A balanced approach, combining moderate sun exposure with dietary intake and supplements (if needed), is ideal for maintaining optimal vitamin D levels.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch9lev3sec29"><h3 class="title">General Tonic Effect</h3>
<p class="noindent">General tonic effect such as improved appetite, improved sleep and reduced irritability may occur due to ultraviolet rays’ irradiation. UVB rays stimulate the production of vitamin D in the skin, essential for calcium absorption, bone health, and immune function. UV rays can stimulate blood vessel dilation, improving circulation and oxygenation of tissues. UV exposure can regulate the immune system by reducing excessive inflammation and boosting the production of antimicrobial peptides, aiding in skin defense.<a name="page251"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">251</span></span> UV rays may stimulate the skin and body metabolism by promoting energy production and cell renewal processes. Controlled UV exposure is used in phototherapy to treat skin conditions like psoriasis, eczema, and vitiligo by reducing inflammation and promoting skin healing. UV exposure boosts the release of endorphins (“feel-good” hormones), improving mood and reducing symptoms of depression, including seasonal affective disorder (SAD). UV rays influence melatonin production, helping regulate sleep-wake cycles, overall energy levels and thereby regulates circadian rhythm. Exposure to sunlight, including UV rays, can reduce cortisol (stress hormone) levels, promoting relaxation and thereby stress reduction.</p>

<div class="section" id="ch9lev2sec23"><h2 class="title">Therapeutic Effects</h2>
<p class="noindent">Various therapeutic effects of ultraviolet rays are counter-irritation, increased blood supply, destruction of bacteria, tissue destruction and desquamation.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch9lev3sec30"><h3 class="title">Counter-irritation</h3>
<p class="noindent">Ultraviolet irradiation may cause irritation of superficial sensory nerve endings and hence, may relieve pain through counter-irritation. Usually, a third-degree erythema dose is required for this purpose. UV counterirritation may be used as an adjunct therapy to alleviate pain in conditions like chronic back pain, joint stiffness, or muscle soreness. In dermatological conditions like psoriasis, UV-induced irritation can distract from itchiness while also promoting healing. Counterirritation through UV rays may stimulate mild inflammation, enhancing blood flow and cellular activity at wound sites.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch9lev3sec31"><h3 class="title">Increased Blood Supply</h3>
<p class="noindent">Ultraviolet rays increase blood supply to the skin as a result of erythema reaction. It can be used in the treatment of certain conditions such as psoriasis, acne, alopecia and chilblains.</p>

<div class="section" id="ch9lev2sec25"><h2 class="title">Hazards and Precautions</h2>
<p class="noindent">Hazards of ultraviolet irradiation are conjunctivitis, overdose, electric shock, burns and chilling sensation. Avoiding exposure of eyes by using dark glasses or glasses made up of Chances Crookes. A glass and using shades around the lamp with the help of cloth.</p>
<p class="indent">Overdose can be prevented by carrying out test dosages on the patient before application. Test dosage can be carried out, so as to find out time duration of irradiation at a particular distance to produce E1 reaction. Once we know the E1 reaction then, one can calculate the time period required at the same distance or any other distance by calculations like:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">E2 (is 2.5 times E1)</p></li>
<li><p class="">E3 (is 5 times E1)</p></li>
<li><p class="">E4 (is 10 times E1)</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">The dose can also be calculated at any other distance by using the following formula:</p>
<div class="informalfigure"><img alt="" src="/MediumImage/253-1.jpg"></div>
<p class="indent">Electric shock can be prevented by regular check-up for leakage of current and proper earthing. Burns may occur if hot part of the lamp is touched. Asking the patient not to touch any part of the ultraviolet generator can prevent electric shock. Chill may occur if total body irradiation is carried out and when the treatment room is too cold. Maintaining adequate room temperature and simultaneous irradiation of patient with infrared rays can prevent it.<a name="page254"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">254</span></span></p>

</div><div class="section" id="ch9lev1sec5"><h1 class="title">PUVA AND IONOZONE THERAPY</h1>
<div class="section" id="ch9lev2sec26"><h2 class="title">PUVA</h2>
<p class="noindent">PUVA is a treatment technique used for the treatment of various diseases in which ultraviolet rays are applied after giving psoralen tablet or after applying psoralen ointment. It is commonly called by its acronym <bold>PUVA (psoralen and ultraviolet A)</bold>. Dr Thomas B Fitzpatrick and his colleagues are the pioneers of PUVA therapy, first describing its clinical application in the early 1970s as a treatment for psoriasis and other skin diseases. PUVA therapy has since become a well-established treatment for several chronic skin conditions.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch9lev3sec35"><h3 class="title">Mechanism of Action</h3>
<p class="noindent">Psoralens (e.g., 8-methoxypsoralen or 5-methoxypsoralen) are photosensitizing compounds taken orally or applied topically. They sensitize the skin to UVA radiation. After psoralen is absorbed, the skin is exposed to UVA (320–400 nm). UVA activates the psoralen, forming DNA crosslinks in skin cells, which slows the rapid proliferation of abnormal skin cells and modulates immune responses, reducing inflammation. DNA damage induces apoptosis (programmed cell death) in overactive immune cells or keratinocytes. Anti-inflammatory effects help reduce symptoms of skin conditions.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch9lev3sec36"><h3 class="title">Indications</h3>
<p class="noindent">PUVA therapy is effective in managing several skin and systemic disorders, including:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Psoriasis:</bold> For moderate to severe cases resistant to other treatments.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Vitiligo:</bold> Stimulates melanocyte activity and re-pigmentation.</p></li>

<li><p class=""><bold>Alopecia areata:</bold> Stimulates hair regrowth by modulating immune activity.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch9lev3sec37"><h3 class="title">Procedure</h3>
<p class="noindent">Psoralen is administered: Orally (taken 1–2 hours before UVA exposure) or topically (inbathwater or as a cream applied to the affected area). Eye protection is provided to prevent UVA-induced cataracts. The patient stands in a UVA phototherapy box for a calculated time based on skin type, condition, and psoralen dosage. Initial sessions start with low doses of UVA, gradually increased. Usually, 2–3 sessions per week are applied and a typical course may involve 20–30 treatments, depending on the condition and response.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch9lev3sec38"><h3 class="title">Advantages</h3>
<p class="noindent">PUVA therapy is highly effective for resistant skin conditions, long-lasting improvement for certain diseases like psoriasis and it can treat large surface areas of the body.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch9lev3sec39"><h3 class="title">Precautions</h3>
<p class="noindent">Avoid natural sunlight for 24–48 hours after therapy to prevent overexposure, wear UVA-blocking glasses during and after treatment for 24 hours and regular skin examinations to monitor for early signs of photodamage or malignancy.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch9lev2sec27"><h2 class="title">Ionozone Therapy</h2>
<p class="noindent">Ionozone therapy is a treatment technique characterized by the use of ultraviolet rays, ionized water and ozone obtained from the passage of steam over mercury vapor lamp. For this purpose, special apparatus called ionozone therapy machine is used. Ionozone therapy is used for relief of pain, increase in superficial blood flow, increase in metabolic processes, increase in oxidation processes and bactericidal effect. Stitch abscess, open wounds, varicose ulcers, diabetic ulcers, pressure sores and acne can be effectively treated by ionozone therapy. In the treatment of these conditions, ionozone therapy can be applied for 10 to 30 minutes at 30 to 50 cm distance from the nozzle of the ionozone therapy apparatus. Ionozone therapy is a type of therapeutic treatment that involves the use of ionized gases, often combined with ozone (O<sub>3</sub>), to treat various health conditions. It typically involves the administration of ozone or ionized air (often through ozone generators) to the body, either externally (through inhalation or skin exposure) or internally (through intravenous infusions or insufflations). While the term “Ionozone” is not universally standardized, it is commonly used to refer to ozone therapy combined with ionization effects or treatments that utilize ionized air for therapeutic purposes.<a name="page256"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">256</span></span></p>
<div class="section" id="ch9lev3sec40"><h3 class="title">Mechanism of Action</h3>
<p class="noindent">Ozone therapy involves the creation of ozone gas (O<sub>3</sub>) through an ozone generator, which produces ozone from oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) in the air. Ozone is a powerful oxidizing agent and has a range of beneficial biological effects. Ionization involves charging air molecules to produce negatively charged ions (anions) or positively charged ions (cations). These ions are believed to have beneficial effects on the body by interacting with the respiratory system, skin, and circulation. In some treatments, ozone may be combined with ionized air, creating a synergistic effect. Ozone's oxidizing properties can help improve cellular metabolism and detoxification, while ions can promote better oxygen absorption and reduce inflammation. When inhaled or applied to the skin, these ionized gases are thought to have various therapeutic effects, including improved oxygenation, enhanced circulation, and the neutralization of harmful free radicals.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch9lev3sec41"><h3 class="title">Indications</h3>
<p class="noindent">Ionozone therapy, particularly in combination with ozone, is used for a variety of health conditions, both dermatological and systemic that includes asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic bronchitis, allergies (seasonal and environmental), sinusitis, peripheral arterial disease (PAD), chronic vascular insufficiency, hypertension (blood pressure regulation), atherosclerosis (plaque buildup in arteries), detoxification of the body by neutralizing free radicals and environmental toxins, improved cellular metabolism, stimulation of collagen production for skin regeneration, joint pain (rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis), back pain, muscular pain and strain, inflammation from sports injuries, tendonitis and other soft tissue injuries, acne, eczema. Psoriasis, wound healing (accelerates tissue repair), anti-aging treatments (improves skin tone and elasticity), immune boosting in chronic illnesses, treatment of autoimmune conditions, viral infections (e.g., herpes simplex, HIV), stress and anxiety reduction, sleep disorders (improves relaxation and circadian rhythms), mental clarity and cognitive enhancement, treatment of chronic fatigue syndrome, chronic ear infections, sinus infections, infected wounds (ozone's bactericidal properties help accelerate healing).<a name="page257"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">257</span></span></p>
<div class="sidebar"><h2 class="title">Summary</h2>
<p class="">LASER is an acronym for light amplification by the stimulated emission of radiation. Therapeutic laser is mainly used for pain relief and acceleration of healing. Therapeutic laser can be applied with the point probe or cluster probe. Infrared rays are also called thermogenic rays. Various laws regulating the absorption of radiation including the infrared rays are Grothus Law, Law of Inverse Square, Cosine Law, Beer-Lambert Law, Kirchhoff's Law, Wien's Law, Stefan-Boltzmann Law and Arndt-Schultz Principle. Various therapeutic effects of infrared rays are relief of pain, muscle relaxation and increased blood supply. Ultraviolet rays are of three types, namely ultraviolet A, B and C. Absorption of ultraviolet rays produces erythema reaction characterized by redness of the skin. Ultraviolet rays may increase vitamin D formation and exert abiotic effect.</p>
