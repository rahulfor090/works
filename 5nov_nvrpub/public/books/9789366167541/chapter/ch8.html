</div><div class="section" id="ch8lev1sec1"><h1 class="title">CRYOTHERAPY (HYPOTHERMY)</h1>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">The therapeutic use of local cold applications for the treatment of various diseases and disorders is known as cryotherapy</span>. In the past, it was often termed as hypothermy. Heat abstraction or cooling by cryotherapeutic agents mostly occurs by conduction except in the case of vapocoolant spray. The magnitude of cooling depends on the area of body surface exposed to cold, the time of exposure, the temperature difference between body tissues and cooling agent, thermal conductivity of the tissues and type of cooling agent. The physics of cooling is based on ‘Newton's Law of Cooling’.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch8lev2sec1"><h2 class="title">Physiological Effects</h2>
<p class="noindent">The physiological effects of cryotherapy are reduced body temperature, reduction in blood supply, reduction in metabolism, and behavioral changes.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch8lev3sec1"><h3 class="title">Body Temperature</h3>
<p class="noindent">Cold causes fall in local body temperature. However, severe local cooling may result in hypothermia. Hypothermia is a condition where the core temperature is below 35°C. It may be a life-threatening situation.<a name="page219"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">219</span></span></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch8lev3sec2"><h3 class="title">Circulatory Effect</h3>
<p class="noindent">Cold application causes reflex vasoconstriction of cutaneous vessels. Application of cold causes an increase in sympathetic nerves activity, smooth muscle contraction and may increase the viscosity of blood. All these changes result in reduced blood flow in the area that is directly cooled. However, when the temperature is reduced below 10°C then cold-induced reflex vasodilation may occur. Reflex vasodilation tends to occur in a cyclic manner and is believed to result from an axon reflex. Reflex vasodilation following cold application was first recognized and reported by Lewis, in 1930. The repeated cyclic vasodilation and vasoconstriction is known as <bold>Huntington's reaction</bold>. Cooling more than 10°C causes pain. Pain impulse or afferent impulse is carried antidromically towards skin arterioles. It leads to liberation of H substance and thereby vasodilation. Once again, continued cooling causes vasoconstriction and these events are repeated.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch8lev3sec3"><h3 class="title">Metabolism</h3>
<p class="noindent">Cooling of tissue decreases the metabolic activity and hence, the energy and oxygen requirements of cells get reduced. This effect is one of the most important effects of cryotherapy especially from the acute injury point of view.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch8lev3sec4"><h3 class="title">Behavioral Changes</h3>
<p class="noindent">Person receiving cold application for prolonged time may adopt a contracted posture. Arms and legs may be drawn up to the body by which the surface area exposed to cooling can be minimized. It is said that contracted posture can reduce the heat loss by up to 60%.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch8lev2sec2"><h2 class="title">Therapeutic Effects</h2>
<div class="section" id="ch8lev3sec5"><h3 class="title">Pain Relief</h3>
<p class="noindent">Cold is one of the highly effective physiotherapeutic modalities in relieving pain. It is commonly used for the relief of acute pain. It can also be used for the relief of acute exacerbation of pain with a chronic background. Pain relief may occur due to counter-irritation, reduced nerve conduction, decreased inflammatory process and relief of muscle spasm.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch8lev3sec6"><h3 class="title">Muscle Spasm</h3>
<p class="noindent">Cryotherapy is effective in relieving the muscle spasm. Relief of spasm may occur due to decreased muscle spindle activity and secondary to the relief of pain.<a name="page220"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">220</span></span></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch8lev3sec7"><h3 class="title">Inflammation</h3>
<p class="noindent">It may bring about early resolution of inflammation by reducing vascular or cellular component of inflammation as a result of vasoconstriction.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch8lev3sec8"><h3 class="title">Swelling</h3>
<p class="noindent">Cold application can reduce the swelling following an acute injury. It may be due to vasoconstriction of arterioles and reduction in extravasations of fluid into interstitial space.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch8lev3sec9"><h3 class="title">Connective Tissue Extensibility</h3>
<p class="noindent">Cryotherapy increases tissue viscosity and consequently decreases the extensibility of the connective tissue. Patient may report an increase in stiffness after cold application and hence thermotherapy is a better choice in the treatment of tightness, contracture and stiffness.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch8lev3sec10"><h3 class="title">Trauma</h3>
<p class="noindent">Cryotherapy is one of the very effective modalities in the treatment of acute injuries. Cryotherapy reduces pain, bleeding and swelling. In addition to this, it increases the survival rate of the tissues. Death of cells following injury may occur due to hypoxia and increased enzyme activity. Hypoxia may occur due to physical tears of blood vessels, edema and vascular congestion. Since the cryotherapy application reduces metabolism and enzyme activity, the survival rate of the damaged tissues increases.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch8lev3sec11"><h3 class="title">Muscle Tone</h3>
<p class="noindent">Cryotherapy can reduce muscle tone. Hence, it is used in the treatment of spasticity. Reduction in spasticity may occur due to decreased activity of efferent gamma fibers.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch8lev3sec12"><h3 class="title">Muscle Strength and Endurance</h3>
<p class="noindent">Muscle strength may increase with short-term application of cryotherapy. But on long-term application, muscle strength gets reduced. However, 1 hour after the cessation of cooling, muscle strength may increase. Motor endurance decreases after cooling below 27°C.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch8lev3sec13"><h3 class="title">Agility</h3>
<p class="noindent">Agility or motor skill gets reduced by cold application. Thus, even though cold reduces spasticity but to teach a motor task after cold application is somewhat difficult.<a name="page221"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">221</span></span></p>
<div class="section" id="ch8lev4sec1"><h4 class="title">Peripheral nerves</h4>
<p class="noindent">Cold can reduce the velocity of sensory conductivity, motor nerve conductivity and synaptic activity, if the temperature of the nerve decreases. Cooling below 12°C may cause paralysis of local sensory and motor nerves.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch8lev2sec3"><h2 class="title">Indications</h2>

</div>
<div class="section" id="ch8lev2sec4"><h2 class="title">Contraindications and Precautions</h2>
<p class="noindent">Cryotherapy is contraindicated in:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Raynaud's disease, Raynaud's phenomenon</p></li>
<li><p class="">Buerger's disease</p></li>

<li><p class="">Cold urticaria</p></li>
<li><p class="">Arteriosclerosis.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">Precautions should be taken while treating a patient with hypertension and local cryotherapy application into an area where nerves are superficial such as, medial epicondyle, axilla and head of fibula. Precautions should also be taken while treating a patient with cardiovascular disease. While treating a patient with hypertension, monitor the blood pressure throughout the treatment.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch8lev2sec5"><h2 class="title">Methods of Application</h2>
<p class="noindent">Vapocoolant sprays, ice cube massage, cold packs, ice packs, ice towels, cold immersion, compressive cryotherapy and chemical cold packs can be used to apply cryotherapy.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch8lev3sec14"><h3 class="title">Vapocoolant Sprays</h3>
<p class="noindent">Vapocoolant sprays or cryogesic sprays <bold>(<a href="#ch8fig1" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 8.1</a>)</bold> are commonly used in the management of sports injuries. The most common type of vapocoolant spray used in physiotherapy is <bold>fluoromethane</bold>.</p>
<div class="figure" id="ch8fig1" data-label="Fig. 8.1"><div class="title"><span class="item-label">Fig. 8.1</span> Vapocoolant sprays.</div><img alt="Fig. 8.1" src="/MediumImage/222-1.jpg"><div class="additional-markup"></div></div>
<p class="noindent"><a name="page223"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">223</span></span>In the past, ethyl chloride vapocoolant sprays were used. But ethyl chloride is flammable, explosive and should not be inhaled. Hence, nowadays, ethyl chloride sprays are rarely used. The spray removes heat from the skin underlying tissue and can be felt like a cool jet stream of fluid on the skin. Spray can be applied along with stretch. The advantage of the spray is, it can be used at home, and it takes very little time to apply the spray. The advantages of vapocoolant sprays are that they offer instantaneous pain relief, it is noninvasive and easy to apply, they allow an immediate return to activity in sports, and it can be combined with physiotherapeutic interventions like stretching and soft tissue mobilization. However, certain precautions should be taken, and they include, avoiding direct inhalation of the spray, do not apply on broken skin, wounds, or over mucous membranes, excessive use can lead to skin irritation, frostbite, or burns, it is contraindicated in individuals with cold hypersensitivity, circulatory disorders, or allergies to the spray components.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Technique of application:</span> First demonstrate it to the patient by applying it on yourself. Then you can apply it on the patient by tilting the spray bottle upside down and aligning it at 30°C to the body part, hold it at 45 cm away from the body part and then apply the spray in a parallel sweep fashion, with a speed of 10 cm per second. You can apply the spray to cover the area twice or thrice. This will cause adequate cooling of the body part. If more spray is indicated, then the body part must be re-warmed to avoid injury to the skin.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch8lev3sec15"><h3 class="title">Ice Massage</h3>
<p class="noindent">Ice massage is usually done over a small area. It is used for pain relief in local area and facilitation of muscle contraction. Muscle contraction can be facilitated by rapid and brief application over the skin dermatome. Massage with ice is simple and inexpensive. Ice cubes are easily available and hence, it is one of the easily accessible modalities to the therapist as well as patient. It is usually applied over bursa, tendon, muscle belly, trigger point (before deep massage) and small areas of muscle spasm. Ice massage can be taught to patients so that it can be used at home.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Technique of application:</span> Water can be frozen in paper cups to make handling of the ice by the physiotherapist easier. The cup is peeled back as the ice melts. As an alternative, water may be frozen in a wax or styrofoam cup with a wooden tongue stick (ice lollipops) in the middle so that the person applying ice will not get cold. Ice cubes from household fridge also can be used for ice massage.<a name="page224"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">224</span></span> During application, a towel can be used to wipe water seepage from the treated area because excess water will be cold and will make the patient uncomfortable. Ice is rubbed over the skin by using small overlapping circles. An area of 10 to 15 cm can be treated in 5 to 10 minutes. If a larger area is involved then, any other method of applying cryotherapy should be considered. The treatment takes usually 5 to 10 minutes for the area to have reduced sensation. Patient will usually experience four distinct sensations, including intense cold, numbness, burning, aching and then analgesia. When the patient touches the area and finds inability to feel the touch sensation, the treatment is completed. Ice massage produces analgesia and continues to do so for 3 to 5 minutes after treatment. To take maximum advantage of analgesic effect, manual therapy should be done immediately after the ice massage.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch8lev3sec16"><h3 class="title">Cold Packs</h3>
<p class="noindent">Cold packs are canvas bags containing silicate gel. Cold packs are available in various sizes and shapes to contour the area to be treated. These packs can be stored in a special refrigerator unit or in a household freezer. Storage temperature should be −5°C for at least 2 hours before use. These packs are reusable, do not reduce the skin temperature as quickly as ice bags, the patients who do not like the cold therapy can tolerate them, cold packs can easily mold to the body part, and they do not open easily as ice packs.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Technique of application:</span> After removal of a cold pack from refrigerator, it is applied on top of the body part to be treated. Keep checking at frequent intervals. For hygienic reasons, a layer of towel can be placed between the pack and the skin surface. Patient should not lie on the top of the cold pack. Many physiotherapists apply a wet towel first to the skin and then apply the cold pack and cover it with another towel or a sheet to insulate the area. If the towel is wet with the room temperature or lukewarm water, the initial contact will be more comfortable for the patient. A strap can secure the cold pack so that the area is well supported. Cold packs are usually applied for 20 minutes. After the removal of cold pack from the treatment area, they should be refrozen for at least 2 hours before the next use of them. For the longer use, the pack should be replaced with another cold pack.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch8lev3sec17"><h3 class="title">Ice Packs</h3>
<p class="noindent">Here, a plastic bag is filled with crushed ice. It can be placed directly on the body part or with wet towel in between patient's skin and ice bag. Ice pack or bag treatment time ranges from 10 to 20 minutes. They are particularly of help in the treatment of patients who had undergone surgery. Ice packs in these patients can reduce the swelling and decrease pain.<a name="page225"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">225</span></span></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch8lev3sec18"><h3 class="title">Ice Towels</h3>
<p class="noindent">Superficial cooling may be achieved using ice towels. Here, terry towel is placed in a bucket containing flaked ice and water then wrung out and applied to the part. It may be used for 5 to 10 minutes for analgesia to occur. Larger area may be covered but the towel needs to be replaced frequently as it warms up rapidly. Treatment with ice towels can be given for up to 20 minutes. Many physiotherapists use this method for cryokinetics or cryostretching techniques.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch8lev3sec19"><h3 class="title">Cold Immersion</h3>
<p class="noindent">Here, extremity is immersed for 3 to 5 seconds in slush bath and then it is removed from bath. Ice immersion can be effectively used for the treatment of extremities.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch8lev3sec20"><h3 class="title">Compressive Cryotherapy</h3>
<p class="noindent">Here, the compressive pumps provide external pressure and cold water to an extremity through the sleeve. It is used to reduce swelling in an area and to prevent loss of function. These machines apply intermittent pressure to the body part, so as to increase the interstitial pressure and pump the fluid back into the venous system. Pressure values used to treat upper extremity are 40 to 60 mm Hg and for lower extremity approximately 60 to 80 mm Hg (10 mm less than diastolic blood pressure of the patient). Usually, the on and off time ratio is 3:1. Treatment time varies and usually lasts for 10 to 15 minutes. With some larger units, two limbs may be treated simultaneously. These machines are used at sports medicine centers for the treatment of sprains, strains, and contusions for reducing edema in acute injuries. Patients with circulatory problems, possibly will have extreme difficulty in tolerating this treatment.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch8lev3sec21"><h3 class="title">Chemical Cold Packs</h3>
<p class="noindent">These are prepacked chemical packs that become cool when chemicals inside it are squeezed. For example, a pack with two components, one filled with water and other with ammonium nitrate which when squeezed, mixes with other contents to produce cooling. These packs are expensive, can be used only once and they can be preferred when ice is not available. These packs may cause a chemical skin burn, if they open accidentally. Chemical cold packs tend to cause poor cooling. These packs are too small, and they are mostly used for immediate management of musculoskeletal injuries.<a name="page226"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">226</span></span></p>
<div class="sidebar"><h2 class="title">Summary</h2>
<p class="">The therapeutic use of local cold application for the treatment of various diseases and disorders is known as cryotherapy. Cold causes a fall in local body temperature. Cold application can reduce the pain, muscle spasms and swelling following an acute injury. Vapocoolant spray, ice cube massage, cold packs, ice packs, ice towels, cold immersion, compressive cryotherapy, and chemical cold packs can be used to apply cryotherapy. While treating a patient with hypertension, monitor the blood pressure throughout the treatment.</p>
