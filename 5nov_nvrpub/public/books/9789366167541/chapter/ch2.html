<p class="noindent">Electrotherapy is a fundamental aspect of physiotherapy, involving the use of electrical energy to treat a wide range of medical conditions. It complements manual therapy, exercise, and other interventions by targeting pain, muscle dysfunction, circulation issues, and more.</p>
<p class="indent">Electrotherapy generally includes various forms of therapeutic applications using electricity as the primary source of energy. In order to have a comprehensive idea, first let us try to understand the meaning of the word therapy. The dictionary meaning of the word ‘therapy’ is, a nonsurgical treatment approach. <bold>‘Electro’</bold> means electrical current or electricity or electrical method. Hence, one can say that electrotherapy is a nonsurgical treatment approach, characterized by the treatment of various diseases and disorders, with the help of electricity or electrical means. Alternatively, one can put it this way, ‘<span class="italic">Electrotherapy is a branch of physiotherapy characterized by the treatment of various diseases and disorders with the help of electricity or electrical means</span>.’<a name="page36"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">36</span></span> Electrotherapy in physiotherapy refers to the application of electrical currents through devices designed to stimulate nerves, muscles, and other tissues. It is widely employed to alleviate pain, enhance healing, and restore function. The integration of electrotherapy in rehabilitation has expanded with advancements in technology, making it a cornerstone of physiotherapy practice.</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Key purposes of electrotherapy include:</span></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Pain relief:</bold> Blocking pain signals and stimulating the release of endorphins.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Muscle stimulation:</bold> Strengthening weak muscles and preventing atrophy.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Wound healing:</bold> Promoting tissue repair through increased circulation.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Inflammation reduction:</bold> Alleviating swelling and improving mobility and</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Nerve regeneration:</bold> Supporting recovery in neurological conditions. Electrotherapy relies on the controlled delivery of electrical energy to achieve therapeutic effects. The <bold>primary mechanisms</bold> include:</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Gate control theory:</bold> Electrical stimulation activates sensory nerve fibers, which can inhibit pain transmission to the brain.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Endorphin release:</bold> Certain frequencies stimulate the body's natural pain-relief mechanisms and</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Muscle contraction:</bold> Direct stimulation of motor nerves facilitates strengthening and re-education.</p>
<p class="">It is one of the essential basic subjects for physiotherapy students. The scope or outline of electrotherapy can be understood with the help of the following diagram.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">In <bold><a href="#ch2fig1" class="ulink-inter">Figure 2.1</a></bold>, there are two common words, one is current and the second is frequency.</p>
<p class="indent">Current is nothing but the flow of electrons. Frequency is the number of occurrences of any event, per unit time. If you take five cups of coffee per day, then I may say that your frequency of coffee intake is five cups per day. Similarly, if you are a smoker and smoke three cigarettes per day, then the frequency of your smoking is three cigarettes per day. With this kind of analogy, let us try to understand the use of the word frequency in electrotherapy. In electrotherapy, we use the currents whose impulses commence and cease at regular interval. The number of times these impulses come in a particular unit time (second) is regarded as frequency. Usually, it is expressed in cycles per second or hertz, kilohertz, megahertz, etc.<a name="page37"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">37</span></span></p>

</div><div class="section" id="ch2lev1sec2"><h1 class="title">LOW-FREQUENCY CURRENTS</h1>
<p class="noindent">Low-frequency currents are therapeutically used currents whose frequency is in the range of 0 to 100 cycles per second. The primary use of low-frequency current is the stimulation of nerves and muscles. Various currents in this category that are used for physiotherapeutic treatments include, direct current, interrupted direct current, sinusoidal current, diadynamic current, high-voltage pulsed galvanic current, micro-amperage electrical nerve stimulation, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, etc.</p>
<p class="indent">These currents are widely used in physiotherapy for therapeutic purposes, as they primarily target sensory and motor nerves. Here are the common types, mechanisms, and clinical applications.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch2lev2sec1"><h2 class="title">Common Types</h2>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Direct current (DC) or galvanic current:</bold> A continuous unidirectional current used for iontophoresis, pain relief, stimulation of denervated muscles, and wound healing.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Faradic current:</bold> It's intermittent pulses of varying frequency and intensity and used for muscle stimulation for strengthening or re-education.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Interrupted galvanic current:</bold> It's a modified galvanic current with periodic interruptions and is used for stimulating denervated muscles or improving circulation.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Sinusoidal current:</bold> It is smooth, repetitive oscillations, mimicking natural muscular contractions, and is used for muscle stimulation and pain relief.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS)</bold> It's a low-frequency current (2–150 Hz), modulated to manage pain and mainly used for the relief of acute and chronic pain.<a name="page38"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">38</span></span></p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch2lev2sec2"><h2 class="title">Mechanism of Action</h2>
<p class="noindent">The mechanism of action includes pain relief, muscle stimulation, improved circulation, and acceleration of healing of wounds and ulcers.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Pain relief:</bold> Pain relief through gate control theory and endorphin theory.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Gate control theory:</bold> Stimulates sensory fibers, blocking pain signals.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Release of endorphins:</bold> Stimulates endogenous opioid systems.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Muscle stimulation:</bold> Restores muscle tone and strength by inducing controlled contractions and prevents muscle atrophy in cases of nerve injuries or prolonged immobilization.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Improved circulation:</bold> Muscle pumping action improves blood flow and reduces swelling.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Wound healing:</bold> Direct current stimulates tissue repair by attracting fibroblasts and other repair cells.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch2lev2sec3"><h2 class="title">Clinical Applications</h2>
<p class="noindent">These include pain relief, muscle re-education, improved function, acceleration of healing, and rehabilitation. Pain Management in conditions: Back pain, arthritis, sports injuries, neuralgia. Muscle weakness for the re-education poststroke, paralysis, or after prolonged immobilization. Improved function in neuromuscular conditions in conditions like facial palsy, Bell's palsy, and peripheral nerve injuries. Tissue healing and swelling in conditions like ulcers, burns, or chronic wounds. Postsurgical rehabilitation is used to prevent muscle atrophy and maintain joint mobility.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch2lev2sec4"><h2 class="title">Contraindications</h2>
<p class="noindent">Contraindications include unconscious patients, epilepsy, mental retardation, unable to communicate, cardiac pacemaker, pregnancy, tumor, radiotherapy, recent fracture, metal implant, open wound, infected wound, hypoesthesia, anesthesia, loss of sensation, leprosy, Henson's disease, deep vein thrombosis, etc.</p>
<p class="indent">For the sake of memory tricks usually, I teach this contraindication by associating one's body parts starting from brain to hand. I say contraindications around your head include unconscious patients, epilepsy, and mental retardation. Contraindications around your mouth include unable to communicate. Contraindications around your heart include cardiac pacemaker. Contraindications around abdomen include pregnancy, tumor, and radiotherapy.<a name="page39"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">39</span></span> Contraindications around your forearm includes open wound, recent fracture, metal implant, loss of sensation, anesthesia, leprosy and Hansen's disease. Contraindications around leg includes deep vein thrombosis. While teaching, I insist the students to put their hands on their head, mouth, and then one hand over their hearts, tummies, forearms, and then legs so that they can recall these contraindications easily throughout their lives!</p>
</div>
</div><div class="section" id="ch2lev1sec3"><h1 class="title">MEDIUM-FREQUENCY CURRENTS</h1>
<p class="noindent">Medium-frequency currents are therapeutically used currents whose frequency is in the range of 1,000 to 10,000 cycles per second. They are basically used to stimulate deeply-situated muscles and nerves since it is difficult to stimulate these muscles and nerves by low-frequency currents without the spread of current. Clinically, they are used for muscle re-education, to retard the rate of muscle atrophy, and for pain relief. Various currents in this category, which are used for physiotherapeutic purposes are Russian current, Interferential current, etc.</p>
<p class="indent">Medium-frequency currents are primarily used for deeper tissue penetration, muscle stimulation, and pain relief while minimizing discomfort due to reduced skin resistance. They play a significant role in physiotherapy due to their efficiency in addressing musculoskeletal conditions and promoting tissue healing. Types of medium-frequency currents include interferential currents, Russian currents and Aussie currents. Interferential Current (IFC) frequency ranges between 2,000–10,000 Hz (usually 4,000 Hz). Two medium-frequency currents intersect to produce a low-frequency current (beat frequency) in the tissues. Applications include pain relief, muscle stimulation, reduction of swelling and inflammation, and improved blood flow. Russian Current has a frequency of 2,500 Hz with a 50 Hz burst frequency. It is delivered in bursts for muscle strengthening and rehabilitation. Applications include enhancing muscle strength postinjury or surgery and muscle re-education. Aussie Current has a frequency: of 1,000 Hz or 4,000 Hz with modulated bursts with characteristic shorter burst duration compared to Russian current, offering a more comfortable experience. Applications of this current include pain relief and muscle strengthening.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch2lev2sec5"><h2 class="title">Mechanism of Action</h2>
<p class="noindent">It includes:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Deep penetration:</bold> Since medium-frequency currents penetrate deeper tissues more effectively due to lower skin resistance, making them ideal for treating larger muscles or deeper structures.<a name="page40"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">40</span></span></p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Pain relief:</bold> Based on the gate control theory (blocking pain signals at the spinal level) and stimulates the release of endorphins for pain modulation.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Muscle stimulation:</bold> Since it induces strong, controlled contractions in muscles and prevents atrophy, and enhances strength.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Improved circulation:</bold> Since it can stimulate blood flow, enhancing oxygen and nutrient delivery to tissues.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch2lev2sec6"><h2 class="title">Clinical Applications</h2>
<p class="noindent">These include pain management in conditions like chronic pain, acute injuries, postsurgical pain, sciatica, and arthritis, muscle rehabilitation in conditions like muscle atrophy, poststroke muscle re-education, and orthopedic injuries, and edema reduction since it can help in reducing swelling through improved lymphatic drainage, improved joint mobility for conditions with stiffness or limited range of motion, postsurgical recovery since it can promotes early mobilization and strengthens weakened muscles and spasticity management since it may be useful in neurological conditions like cerebral palsy or multiple sclerosis. Advantages of medium-frequency currents include greater depth of penetration with minimal discomfort, effective for large or deep muscle groups and better tolerance compared to low-frequency currents.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch2lev2sec7"><h2 class="title">Contraindications</h2>
<p class="noindent">Medium frequency current is contraindicated in patients with cardiac pacemakers, advanced cardiac disease, hypertension, hypotension, thrombosis, recent hemorrhage, pregnancy, neoplasm, tuberculosis, fever, infection, and active epiphyseal region. It is believed that treatment of arterial diseases with interferential current could produce emboli, in the acute phase of deep vein thrombosis, it is possible that thrombi could get dislodged or increase the inflammation of the vein, that is phlebitis. The treatment of an area of infection can cause aggravation of the symptoms, infection could spread, treatment of pelvic region with interferential current is not safe for fetus. Direct stimulation of the tumor is contraindicated, but referred pain from the tumor or metastasis can be treated with interferential current in hospices.</p>
<p class="noindent"><bold>Precautions:</bold> Avoid use near the chest in cardiac patients and ensure proper electrode placement to avoid discomfort or unintended muscle activation.<a name="page41"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">41</span></span></p>
</div>
</div><div class="section" id="ch2lev1sec4"><h1 class="title">HIGH-FREQUENCY CURRENTS</h1>
<p class="noindent">High-frequency currents are therapeutically used currents whose frequency is more than 10,000 cycles per second. High-frequency currents are used for their ability to produce deep heat inside the tissues. Various electrotherapeutic modalities, which work on this type of current are short-wave diathermy, long-wave diathermy, therapeutic ultrasound, and microwave diathermy.</p>
<p class="indent">High-frequency currents (HFC) in electrotherapy unlike low- and medium-frequency currents, these currents primarily produce thermal effects and are used for deep tissue heating, promoting healing, pain relief, and tissue regeneration. High-frequency currents are nonstimulatory, meaning they do not directly cause muscle contractions.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch2lev2sec8"><h2 class="title">Types</h2>
<p class="noindent">Types of high-frequency currents include long-wave diathermy, short-wave diathermy, microwave diathermy, and therapeutic ultrasound.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Shortwave diathermy (SWD):</bold> It's frequency is 27.12 MHz (most common), uses electromagnetic waves to generate deep tissue heating and its applications includes pain relief (e.g., osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis), muscle relaxation and promoting soft tissue healing.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Microwave diathermy (MWD):</bold> It has a frequency of 2450 MHz, it uses microwaves for localized heating and applications includes treatment of superficial and localized conditions, pain relief and tissue healing. Ultrasound therapy (US) utilizes usually a frequency of 1 MHz (deep tissues) or 3 MHz (superficial tissues), uses mechanical high-frequency sound waves. Applications: includes deep heating of muscles, tendons, and ligaments, reduction of inflammation and pain and soft tissue healing.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch2lev2sec9"><h2 class="title">Mechanism of Action</h2>
<p class="noindent">Mechanism of action includes thermal effects, nonthermal effects, improved metabolism and relief of pain. Thermal effects through increased tissue temperature enhances blood circulation, reduces stiffness, and promotes healing by improving nutrient and oxygen supply. Nonthermal effects (specific to ultrasound) like cavitation or formation of microbubbles in tissues for mechanical stimulation, acoustic streaming: Movement of fluids around cells to enhance cellular repair. Pain relief since heat reduces muscle spasm and inhibits pain transmission by relaxing tissues. Improved metabolism and healing since increased temperature accelerates enzymatic reactions and tissue repair processes.<a name="page42"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">42</span></span></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch2lev2sec10"><h2 class="title">Clinical Applications</h2>
<p class="noindent">These include pain management in chronic and acute pain conditions such as arthritis, low back pain, and myofascial pain, muscle relaxation since it alleviates muscle spasms and tension, soft tissue healing since it enhances the healing of tendons, ligaments, and muscles. Improved joint mobility since it is useful in treating stiffness or reduced range of motion in joints. Postsurgical recovery since it can help in wound healing and scar tissue management and management of chronic conditions like fibromyalgia, spondylitis, and bursitis.</p>
<p class="indent">The advantages of high-frequency currents are they can penetrate deep tissues without discomfort, provide targeted heating for both superficial and deep tissues, and promote natural healing without causing muscular contractions. Contraindications include cardiac pacemakers or implanted electronic devices, and pregnancy (especially near the abdomen or pelvic region). Areas with malignant tumors and acute infections or inflammation, over metallic implants (for certain modalities like MWD), thrombosis, or thrombophlebitis.</p>
<p class="noindent"><bold>Precautions:</bold> Avoid overheating tissues, which can lead to burns, ensure proper technique and settings for each modality to prevent side effects, and avoid treating areas with impaired sensation.</p>
</div>
</div><div class="section" id="ch2lev1sec5"><h1 class="title">PHOTOTHERAPY</h1>
<p class="noindent">Phototherapy refers to the treatment of various diseases and disorders with the help of light. The primary effect of these phototherapeutic modalities is pain relief, by heat and acceleration of healing through elevation of temperature, counter-irritation and photochemical effects. Various modalities, such as, infrared rays, ultraviolet rays and laser come under this category.</p>
<p class="indent">Phototherapy is a versatile and effective modality in physiotherapy, offering unique benefits for pain relief, tissue repair, and dermatological care. When used appropriately, it enhances patient outcomes with minimal side effects. Phototherapy such as laser therapy, ultraviolet (UV) therapy, and infrared (IR) therapy, to promote healing, reduce pain, and manage various musculoskeletal and skin conditions. Although not strictly classified under traditional electrotherapy, phototherapy is often grouped within physiotherapeutic modalities due to its overlapping applications. Types of phototherapy in physiotherapy include LASER, IR and UVR.<a name="page43"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">43</span></span></p>
<div class="section" id="ch2lev2sec11"><h2 class="title">Laser Therapy</h2>
<p class="noindent">Laser therapy [low-level laser therapy (LLLT)] utilizes monochromatic, coherent laser light with wavelength: Red (600–700 nm) or near-infrared (700–1,200 nm). The mechanism is through biostimulation since it penetrates tissues to stimulate cellular processes (photobiomodulation). Applications include pain management (e.g., tendinitis, arthritis, neuralgia), wound healing, reduction of inflammation, and muscle and soft tissue injuries.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch2lev2sec12"><h2 class="title">Infrared Therapy</h2>
<p class="noindent">Infrared therapy (IR) utilizes the light source inform of infrared lamps with wavelength—700–1,000 nm, mechanism is thermal since it generates heat to promote circulation and tissue relaxation. Applications include pain relief (e.g., muscle spasms, low back pain), improved local blood circulation and relaxation of stiff joints and muscles. Ultraviolet therapy (UV) utilizes the light source: UV lamps (UVA, UVB, UVC) with wavelength: UVA: 315–400 nm, UVB: 280–315 nm and UVC: 100–280 nm. Mechanism includes stimulating anti-inflammatory effects, vitamin D production, bactericidal effects, and skin healing. Applications include psoriasis and eczema, chronic ulcers and infected wounds, vitiligo and other dermatological conditions. Advantages of phototherapy include noninvasive and painless, targeting deep and superficial tissues, and promoting natural healing processes. Contraindications include cancerous areas or tumors, pregnancy (avoid treatment over the abdomen), active infections or fever, photosensitive skin conditions, and recent exposure to corticosteroids. Precautions include proper eye protection is essential (especially for laser and UV therapies), dosage and duration must be carefully controlled to prevent burns or adverse effects, and ensure skin is clean and free of oils or creams before treatment.</p>
</div>
</div><div class="section" id="ch2lev1sec6"><h1 class="title">ELECTRODIAGNOSIS</h1>
<p class="noindent">Electrical currents can also be used for the diagnostic purpose. Electrodiagnosis means, the detection of diseases and disorders by the use of electrotherapeutic currents or electromyography. We can use currents like interrupted direct current, and perform various electrodiagnostic tests such as, rheobase, chronaxie, strength- duration curve, pulse ratio, myasthenic reaction, galvanic-tetanic ratio, nerve conduction test, nerve distribution test, faradic-galvanic test, etc. Electromyography is the study of electrical activity of the muscle by means of surface electrodes placed over the skin, or needle electrodes inserted in the muscle itself. By electromyography, we can study motor unit potential, motor nerve conduction velocity, sensory nerve conduction velocity, etc.<a name="page44"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">44</span></span></p>
<p class="indent">Electrodiagnosis is an invaluable diagnostic tool in physiotherapy, offering detailed insights into nerve and muscle function. It helps physiotherapists develop targeted treatment plans and monitor the effectiveness of rehabilitation interventions. Electrodiagnosis in physiotherapy involves the use of electrical currents to evaluate the functional integrity of nerves and muscles. It is an essential tool for diagnosing neuromuscular disorders, monitoring disease progression, and planning rehabilitation programs. Electrodiagnosis primarily focuses on assessing the electrical activity and response of tissues, particularly in cases of nerve injuries, muscle diseases, and peripheral neuropathies. The purpose of electrodiagnosis is to identify neuromuscular disorders, determine the severity and location of injury guide treatment planning monitor recovery, differentiate between nerve, muscle, or junctional pathologies, assess the extent and location of nerve or muscle damage, assist in setting goals for rehabilitation or determining the prognosis, track changes in nerve and muscle function over time. Methods of electrodiagnosis include nerve conduction studies (NCS), electromyography (EMG), reaction of degeneration (RD) test, strength-duration (S-D) curve, H-reflex and F-wave studies. Common conditions diagnosed using electrodiagnosis includes peripheral neuropathies like diabetic neuropathy, Guillain-Barré syndrome, nerve Injuries like brachial plexus injury, sciatic nerve injury, muscle disorders like myopathies, muscular dystrophy, neurological disorders like motor neuron diseases (ALS, polio) and compression syndromes like carpal tunnel, tarsal tunnel. Advantages of electrodiagnosis include noninvasive or minimally invasive, objective and quantifiable data, accurate diagnosis and treatment planning, and the ability to monitor nerve and muscle recovery. Precautions includes ensure the patient is comfortable and relaxed during the procedure, avoid in patients with pacemakers or implanted electronic devices (for NCS), use sterile techniques for needle EMG to prevent infections and consider contraindications, such as skin infections or uncooperative patients. Limitations includes electrodiagnostic tests do not measure pain directly, requires skilled interpretation of results and some discomfort may occur with needle EMG or electrical stimulation.<a name="page45"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">45</span></span></p>
</div><div class="section" id="ch2lev1sec7"><h1 class="title">BIOFEEDBACK</h1>
<p class="noindent">Biofeedback is the process of furnishing the information to an individual about the body function so as to get some voluntary control over it. Some biofeedback devices are related to electrotherapy and hence, they can be included under electrotherapy, for example, EMG biofeedback. However, one should remember that there are many biofeedback devices which work on mechanical principles. Biofeedback is a powerful, evidence-based tool in physiotherapy that empowers patients to take control of their recovery process. It is especially effective in neuromuscular re-education, stress management, and pain reduction. When integrated into a rehabilitation program, biofeedback enhances patient outcomes and improves overall quality of life. Biofeedback is a technique used in physiotherapy that helps individuals gain awareness and control over physiological functions using electronic monitoring devices. It is an integral part of electrotherapy, often used to improve motor control, reduce pain, and manage stress-related conditions. By providing real-time feedback, biofeedback enhances a patient's ability to make voluntary changes in bodily functions, such as muscle activity, heart rate, or breathing patterns. Principles of biofeedback include monitoring physiological signals, real-time feedback, self-regulation, and learning. Types of biofeedback in physiotherapy include electromyographic (EMG) biofeedback, thermal biofeedback, heart rate variability (HRV) biofeedback, galvanic skin response (GSR) biofeedback, and respiratory biofeedback. Mechanism of action includes awareness, control, therapeutic progress through real-time feedback that makes patients conscious of involuntary physiological processes, control by focusing on the feedback, patients learn to voluntarily alter these processes (e.g., relaxing a muscle) and therapeutic progress through repeated sessions improve motor control, relaxation, or physiological regulation, aiding recovery. Clinical applications of biofeedback in physiotherapy include neuromuscular reduction, muscle relaxation, pain management, pelvic floor training, rehabilitation of postinjury or surgery, stress and anxiety, and sports rehabilitation. Neuromuscular re-education in conditions like poststroke rehabilitation, Bell's palsy, and peripheral nerve injuries to enhance motor control and muscle coordination. Muscle relaxation in conditions like spasticity, tension headaches, or TMJ dysfunction since it helps reduce muscle overactivity. Pain management in conditions like chronic pain, fibromyalgia, or myofascial pain syndrome since it can relieve pain through relaxation and stress reduction. Pelvic floor training in conditions like urinary or fecal incontinence, and pelvic pain since it can improve voluntary control over pelvic floor muscles.<a name="page46"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">46</span></span> Rehabilitation of Postinjury or surgery since it enhances muscle activation and prevents atrophy during recovery. Stress and anxiety reduction as biofeedback helps patients regulate stress responses and manage anxiety-related conditions. Sports rehabilitation since biofeedback improves neuromuscular coordination and performance in athletes. Advantages of biofeedback include noninvasive and safe, encourages active patient participation in rehabilitation, provides real-time, measurable results, can be combined with other physiotherapy modalities, and reduces reliance on medications for pain or stress management. Precautions include requiring patient cooperation and motivation for effective outcomes, not suitable for individuals with severe cognitive impairments, and training sessions may require specialized equipment and expertise. Biofeedback devices commonly used include EMG biofeedback machines, thermal biofeedback sensors, portable biofeedback devices for HRV and GSR, and interactive apps for biofeedback therapy.</p>
</div><div class="section" id="ch2lev1sec8"><h1 class="title">CLASSIFICATION OF CURRENTS</h1>
<p class="noindent">Therapeutic currents can be classified based on direction, frequency, voltage, amperage and biophysical effects.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch2lev2sec13"><h2 class="title">On the Basis of Direction</h2>
<p class="noindent">On the basis of the direction of the flow, therapeutic currents can be classified as, alternating and unidirectional currents. Unidirectional currents are those that flow in one direction only, for example, direct current and interrupted direct current. Alternating currents flow in both directions. Examples of these types of currents are sinusoidal currents and interferential currents. Both alternating currents (AC) and unidirectional or direct currents (DC) play vital roles in electrotherapy, and their selection depends on the clinical goals, patient condition, and specific therapeutic needs <bold>(<a href="#ch2tbl1" class="ulink-inter">Table 2.1</a>)</bold>. Alternating current (AC): Ideal for stimulating muscles and nerves, pain relief, and deep tissue heating. Unidirectional current (DC): Best suited for tissue healing, drug delivery, and stimulating denervated muscles. Alternating current (AC) and unidirectional current (DC) are two fundamental types of electrical currents used in electrotherapy. Both have distinct characteristics, mechanisms of action, and therapeutic applications in physiotherapy. Alternating current periodically reverses direction and changes its polarity. The current oscillates between positive and negative phases over time.<a name="page47"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">47</span></span></p>

</table></div><div class="additional-markup"></div></div>
<p class="noindent">Waveform: Sinusoidal, triangular, or rectangular. Frequency measured in hertz (Hz); common AC frequencies in electrotherapy include low (e.g., TENS), medium (e.g., IFC), and high (e.g., SWD). Polarity alternates between positive and negative; hence, there is no net charge accumulation. Applications include pain relief, muscle stimulation and deep heating. Pain relief can be obtained with transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) uses low-frequency AC for pain modulation and interferential current (IFC) combines two medium-frequency AC currents to target deep tissues. Muscle stimulation can be obtained by alternating current since AC can activate muscles, especially in functional electrical stimulation (FES). Deep tissue heating with alternating current like high-frequency AC currents are used in diathermy (SWD and MWD) to produce therapeutic heat. Advantages of alternating current include the minimal risk of chemical burns due to the absence of net ionic movement, effective in stimulating nerves and muscles, and can penetrate deeper tissues. Examples of AC modalities include interferential therapy (IFT): Medium-frequency AC used for pain relief and muscle relaxation, Russian Current: Medium-frequency burst AC used for muscle strengthening. Shortwave Diathermy (SWD): High-frequency AC used for deep tissue heating. Unidirectional current (DC): Unidirectional current flows in a single direction, maintaining a constant polarity, also known as galvanic current. Characteristics include continuous, nonalternating waveform, polarity is fixed, with one electrode being positive (anode) and the other negative (cathode) and it causes ionic movement since it causes the migration of ions, leading to chemical effects at the skin.<a name="page48"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">48</span></span> Applications include tissue healing since DC promotes tissue repair by enhancing blood flow and cellular activity and it is commonly used in wound healing and pressure ulcer management. Iontophoresis: DC is used to deliver medications (e.g., anti-inflammatory drugs) transdermally via ionic migration. Muscle stimulation: DC is effective in denervated muscle stimulation, where nerve supply is absent. Electrodiagnosis: Reaction of degeneration (RD) testing uses DC to evaluate nerve and muscle integrity. Advantages include it can drive ions through tissues for therapeutic purposes (e.g., iontophoresis) and promotes tissue healing and wound repair. Precautions include the risk of chemical burns due to prolonged exposure to one polarity and require careful monitoring of intensity and duration. Examples of DC modalities include galvanic current and continuous unidirectional current for tissue repair. High-voltage pulsed current (HVPC): Pulsed unidirectional current for wound healing and Iontophoresis: DC used for drug delivery.</p>

<div class="section" id="ch2lev2sec14"><h2 class="title">On the Basis of Frequency</h2>
<p class="noindent">On the basis of frequency, therapeutic currents can be classified as low-frequency, medium-frequency, and high-frequency currents. In low-frequency currents, the frequency ranges between 0 to 1000 hertz, in medium frequency the frequency is in the range of 1000 hertz to 10,000 hertz and in high frequency, the frequency is above 100,000 Hz (100 kHz to several MHz). Examples and more about these currents are mentioned earlier. Each frequency range serves specific therapeutic purposes, making them indispensable in physiotherapy practice. Low-frequency currents: Best for sensory and motor nerve stimulation, medium-frequency currents: More comfortable and effective for deeper tissues, and high-frequency currents: Used primarily for thermal effects and circulation improvement <bold>(<a href="#ch2tbl2" class="ulink-inter">Table 2.2</a>)</bold>.</p>

High voltage currents are with a voltage of several hundred volts, for example, high frequency currents.</p>
<p class="indent">This classification is primarily determined by the electrical potential (voltage) applied during therapy, which influences the depth of tissue penetration, physiological effects, and therapeutic applications and this classification provides a practical framework for selecting the appropriate modality based on the therapeutic goals and patient needs.</p>

Low-amperage currents are safe, comfortable, and suitable for conditions requiring mild stimulation, such as sensory nerve activation or tissue repair. High-amperage currents are effective for deep tissue penetration, muscle re-education, and stronger therapeutic effects. However, they require careful monitoring to prevent discomfort or adverse effects. Selecting the appropriate amperage ensures the safety and efficacy of electrotherapy interventions tailored to the patient's condition and therapeutic goals.</p>

<p class="noindent">Electrotherapy currents can be classified based on their biophysical effects, which refer to how the current interacts with the body's tissues at the cellular, neural, and muscular levels. This classification highlights the therapeutic goals achieved by different types of currents. On the basis of biophysical effects, therapeutic currents can be divided into two types namely, currents causing ionic changes and currents causing thermal changes. Understanding biophysical effects helps physiotherapists select appropriate electrotherapy modalities tailored to specific therapeutic goals, such as pain relief, tissue healing, or muscle rehabilitation. Please refer to the <bold><a href="#ch2tbl5" class="ulink-inter">Table 2.5</a></bold> that summarizes various biophysical effects of therapeutic currents used in electrotherapy.</p>

<p class="noindent"><a name="page51"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">51</span></span>One may think that it is not a part of electrotherapy but traditionally, cold is described along with heat and hence mostly we find that cold therapy and other things such as paraffin wax bath, hot pack, contrast bath, fluidotherapy, etc., are often described in electrotherapy textbooks. However, personally, I like authors who put the title of their textbook as Physical Agents, since it avoids the dilemma of what can be included in electrotherapy. One should be aware of the fact that all physiotherapy modalities that work on electricity may not be necessarily called electrotherapeutic modalities. I always remember Professor Mokashi Sir asking undergraduate students this question: “Is traction an electrotherapy modality?” Of course, the answer is “no”. But a few students may get confused and may say “yes”. We have continuous passive motion devices, intermittent compression devices, and traction machines, which may work on electricity, but should not be ideally called electrotherapy modalities.</p>
<p class="indent">Students of physical therapy must appreciate the fact that any form of physical energy applied to the body creates significant primary as well as secondary physiological effects. There is a need to accurately measure the dosages in the application of all physical agents just as in the use of medication, there is a therapeutic range required to achieve the desired effects. Too low an intensity may not produce any physiological changes and too high a dose may produce serious detrimental consequences. Also, as in medication, there is a need to determine when to discontinue the use of these electrotherapeutic procedures, as these cannot be utilized indiscriminately by using it almost indefinitely in patients who may not further benefit from its continued use. However, we should keep in mind that even if we use too many sophisticated or complicated electrotherapy machines in treating the patients, they just form a part of total physiotherapy management. We should not forget other things such as, the human touch, which we can always offer to our patients through manual therapy.</p>
</div>
</div><div class="section" id="ch2lev1sec9"><h1 class="title">ACTIVE AND PASSIVE MODALITIES</h1>
<p class="noindent">In the past, there was a growing trend to term modalities, as active modalities and passive modalities. The concept of active and passive modality depends on whether the patient or physiotherapist is involved during the entire treatment. Most of the manual therapy procedures and various exercises were termed as active modalities whereas, electrotherapy and some physical modalities like motorized traction, continuous passive motion devices were termed as passive modalities. It was emphasized that passive modalities alone were not to be relied on as they were believed to be rarely effective. However, it was recommended that during the early phase of treatment, these passive modalities should be used to reduce pain, muscle spasm, swelling and edema, correct tone of muscles and promote healing.<a name="page52"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">52</span></span></p>

<p class="indent">Passive modalities were also believed to have role in chronic pain, spasm, altered muscle tension, adhesions and limited range of motion. Today, the general agreement is that passive modalities is one part of the treatment and active modalities is another part. The clinician should be well versed with the benefits and dangers of these modalities <bold>(<a href="#ch2tbl6" class="ulink-inter">Table 2.6</a>)</bold>.</p>
<p class="indent">Active modalities are typically used when the goal is to improve functional recovery, muscle strength, and neuromuscular re-education. Passive modalities are more appropriate for pain management, tissue healing, and relaxation, where the patient remains stationary or does not need to actively engage in the treatment. Selecting between active and passive modalities depends on the patient's condition, therapeutic goals, and the desired outcomes of the electrotherapy intervention.</p>
</div><div class="section" id="ch2lev1sec10"><h1 class="title">APPROACHES TO ELECTROTHERAPY</h1>
<p class="noindent">For the sake of understanding, two approaches to electrotherapy can be explained as a matter of philosophy. These two approaches include the hammering approach and tickling approach <bold>(<a href="#ch2fig2" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 2.2</a>)</bold>. Here, hammering means, addition of more energy, and tickling means addition of much smaller energy to the cell membrane to change its behavior. By either hammering or tickling a living cell, an excitement is created, so that its endogenous potential is accelerated. Since it is believed that an excited cell will do the same job as a bored cell, but it will do so at a faster and harder rate. Thus, by using the modality, we apply energy to get excitement in the tissues. Thus, it is the excited tissue which does the work rather than the modality itself. This can be further explained with short-wave diathermy modality, that can be applied with continuous mode, which is comparable with hammering, or it can be applied with pulsed mode which is comparable with tickling.<a name="page53"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">53</span></span></p>

<p class="indent">The hammering and tickling approaches in electrotherapy refer to specific techniques of stimulation application that involve altering the current parameters to achieve different therapeutic effects on the body <bold>(<a href="#ch2tbl7" class="ulink-inter">Table 2.7</a>)</bold>. These techniques are often used in the context of electrical stimulation therapy for pain management, muscle stimulation, and other therapeutic goals. Hammering is typically applied for muscle relaxation, pain relief, and improving circulation, especially in conditions requiring more intense stimulation. Tickling is often used for chronic pain management, stress relief, and sensory nerve activation, where the intensity needs to be gentle and non-intrusive. These approaches provide flexibility in treatment, allowing therapists to tailor the electrotherapy experience based on the patient's needs and the nature of their condition.</p>

<div class="sidebar"><h2 class="title">Summary</h2>
<p class="">Electrotherapy is one of the fundamental aspects of physiotherapy, involving the use of electrical energy to treat a wide range of medical conditions. It complements manual therapy, exercise, and other interventions by targeting pain, muscle dysfunction, circulation issues, and more. Various areas of study in electrotherapy are low frequency currents, medium frequency currents, high frequency currents, phototherapy, electrodiagnosis and biofeedback. Low frequency currents are used for stimulation of muscles and nerves. Medium frequency currents are used for re-education of deeply situated muscles, pain relief and for drainage of edema. High frequency currents are used to produce deep heat inside the tissues. Phototherapy is used for pain relief and acceleration of healing. Electrodiagnosis helps in the study of electrical reactions of muscles and nerves for diagnostic purpose.</p>
