</div><div class="section" id="ch6lev1sec1"><h1 class="title">SHORT-WAVE DIATHERMY</h1>
<p class="noindent">Short-wave diathermy is the most commonly used physiotherapeutic modality for deep heating. The meaning of ‘<bold>diathermy</bold>’ is heat given through an object and not confined to that object (Nagel Schmidt, 1908). Short-wave diathermy has been used for more than 50 years by physiotherapists around the globe, for deep heating purposes. For short-wave diathermy, a high-frequency current with a frequency of 27.12 MHz and an 11-meter wavelength is used. Other high-frequency currents with their corresponding wavelengths, which are less commonly used, are 45 MHz with 7 meters and 13 MHz with 22 meters.</p>
<p class="indent">SWD remains a valuable tool in physiotherapy for targeted therapeutic effects. Its proper application demands a thorough understanding of the patient's condition, anatomy, and safety considerations. In recent years, the popularity of SWD has been shaky due to the emergence of alternative modalities like ultrasound and laser therapy, however, the appreciable fact is slowly short-wave diathermy machines are now available in portable form and nowadays even solid-state short-wave diathermy machines are available in the market. However, it remains one of the principal electrotherapy interventions since its inception and by understanding this modality, practitioners can appreciate SWD's role in the broader spectrum of physiotherapeutic modalities and adapt its use to present-day needs.<a name="page171"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">171</span></span></p>
<p class="indent"><span class="italic">Advantages</span> of short-wave diathermy include that it is noninvasive and painless, it is capable of deep tissue heating and it is effective for chronic and subacute conditions. <span class="italic">Disadvantages</span> of short-wave diathermy are that there is a risk of burns if improperly applied, it requires careful positioning and setup and there is a decline in the use as compared to past due to advancements in other modalities like ultrasound and laser therapy.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch6lev2sec1"><h2 class="title">Production</h2>
<div class="section" id="ch6lev3sec1"><h3 class="title">Principle</h3>
<p class="noindent">It is not possible to produce a high-frequency current required for short-wave diathermy by mechanical means. Hence, discharging a condenser through an inductance of low ohmic resistance produces high-frequency current with the desired frequency and wavelength.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch6lev3sec2"><h3 class="title">Circuit</h3>
<p class="noindent">The basic circuit consists of two parts, oscillator circuit and resonator circuit. In addition to this, an ammeter can be integrated in resonator circuit to register the resonance between oscillator circuit and resonance circuit.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p class=""><bold>Oscillator circuit:</bold> It consists of a condenser and inductance. The values of condenser and inductance are such that they produce high frequency current with a frequency of 27.12 MHz. A valve is used along with condenser and inductance, to allow repeated charging and discharging of the condenser.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Resonator circuit:</bold> It is also known as patient's circuit. It consists of a variable condenser and an inductance coil. High frequency currents are transmitted from oscillator circuit to resonator circuit with the help of a variable condenser.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Ammeter:</bold> The ammeter does not show the amount of current received by the patient, but it shows when the oscillator and resonating circuits are in tune with each other. In most of the imported machines there is an automatic tuner (just like television sets) and hence, the ammeter is not included in these types of machines. Circuit diagram is shown in <bold><a href="#ch6fig1" class="ulink-inter">Figure 6.1</a></bold>.</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch6lev3sec3"><h3 class="title">Working</h3>
<p class="noindent">When mains are switched on, it causes repeated charging and discharging of condenser C1 and produces high frequency current in oscillator circuit.<a name="page172"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">172</span></span></p>
<div class="figure" id="ch6fig1" data-label="Fig. 6.1"><div class="title"><span class="item-label">Fig. 6.1</span> Circuit diagram of short-wave diathermy.</div><img alt="Fig. 6.1" src="/MediumImage/172-1.jpg"><div class="caption"><p class=""><span class="italic">(T1: step-up transformer; T2: step-down transformer; R: variable resistance; AB: inductance coil of oscillator circuit; ABC1 and power tube: oscillator circuit; CD: feedback coil which controls grid potential; EFC2: resonator circuit).</span></p></div><div class="additional-markup"></div></div>
<p class="noindent">As a result, high frequency current is also likely to develop in resonator circuit but maximum high frequency current can be produced in resonator circuit, if oscillator and resonator circuits are in tune or are in resonance with each other. Tuning can be obtained manually by varying the capacity of the C2 condenser and the same can be confirmed from ammeter, which will show maximum deflection if these two circuits are in resonance with each other. In an automatic tuner, the machine does this automatically. Output is controlled by power or intensity control of the machine, which regulates the output by adjusting the grid bias of valve through variable resistance.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch6lev2sec2"><h2 class="title">Electrodes and Arrangement of Electrodes</h2>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Electrodes are conductors through which current is applied to the body tissue</span>. In case of short-wave diathermy, electrodes are the conductors through which short-wave diathermy current is applied. Nowadays, pad electrodes, disk electrodes, monodes, minodes, drum electrodes, and occasionally sinus electrodes are used for short-wave diathermy applications. However, in the past, several electrodes, such as cable electrodes, axillary electrodes, rectal electrodes, and vaginal electrodes were used.</p>
<p class="indent">Condenser field electrodes such as pad or disk electrodes can be arranged in monopolar, coplanar, contraplanar, and crossfire arrangements.<a name="page173"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">173</span></span></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>In monopolar arrangement:</bold> One electrode that may act as an active electrode is placed over the area to be treated and the other indifferent electrode is applied to some distant part of the body with maximum spacing so that the heating is produced at only the specific area that is treated.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>In coplanar arrangement:</bold> Electrodes are placed side-by-side on the same aspect of the part to be treated, provided that there is an adequate distance between them. This arrangement is commonly used in the treatment of the back.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>In contraplanar arrangement:</bold> Electrodes are placed over opposite aspects of the body part treated, so that high-frequency current is directed through the tissues. The contraplanar method is commonly used in the treatment of hip joints.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>In crossfire arrangement:</bold> Half the treatment is given with the electrodes in one position then the arrangement is changed, so that the electric field lies at right angles to the electric field obtained in the first part of the treatment. It is commonly used in the treatment of knee joints, treatment of sinuses, pelvis, and thorax.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">While arranging the electrodes during the treatment, consideration should be given to the electrode size, spacing, and position of the electrode. The size of the electrode should be larger than the body part that is to be treated, spacing should be as wide as the output the machine permits. In the space between the electrode and the body part, there should be a medium with low dielectric constant such as air, felt with air columns or towels. Electrodes should be positioned in such a way that they are parallel to the body part to be treated.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch6lev2sec3"><h2 class="title">Physiological Effects</h2>
<p class="noindent">The main physiological effect of short-wave diathermic current on the body tissue is heat production and other physiological effects result from the increase in temperature.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch6lev3sec4"><h3 class="title">Temperature</h3>
<p class="noindent">Short-wave diathermy application produces heat in the body tissues. Increase in local temperature may occur due to the production of heat. But, if the short-wave diathermy is applied for a prolonged time, then there is a rise in general body temperature by a few degrees. The general rise in body temperature occurs due to blood that passes through the tissues in which the rise of temperature has occurred. The heated blood carries heat to other parts of the body.<a name="page174"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">174</span></span></p>
<p class="indent">Short wave diathermy (SWD) primarily affects local tissue temperature, but it can also influence general body temperature depending on the duration, intensity, and mode of application. The primary mechanism of SWD is to increase local tissue temperature through the absorption of electromagnetic energy. Deep heating with SWD raises the temperature of tissues such as muscles, ligaments, and joint capsules. Depending on the intensity, the temperature may increase by 4 to 6°C. When the capacitive method is applied it focuses on tissues with lower conductivity and higher resistance, such as fat and skin, and when the inductive method is applied it heats tissues with high conductivity, such as muscles and blood. The rise in temperature enhances enzymatic activity, metabolic processes, and local circulation. The heating effect promotes muscle relaxation and decreases joint stiffness. The effect of SWD on the overall body temperature is minimal under typical clinical use. However, there are exceptions like extended treatment sessions over large areas may lead to systemic heat accumulation and slight increases in core temperature. When local or general body temperature rises, the body activates thermoregulatory mechanisms like vasodilation, sweating, and redistribution of blood flow. Factors influencing temperature effects are: Mode of application, intensity, duration and tissue properties. Continuous SWD (CSWD) generates more heat than pulsed SWD (PSWD); with higher intensity, it leads to greater thermal effects, longer sessions increase the likelihood of both local and general temperature rises and tissue with water content, conductivity, and vascularization of tissues affect the degree of temperature increase. <bold>Clinical implications</bold> include the localized benefit of heating, and it is useful for conditions requiring deep tissue heating, such as chronic joint and muscle disorders, localized temperature increase promotes pain relief, relaxation, and healing. Risk of burns or excessive heat accumulation if not carefully monitored and adequate cooling periods or pulsed modes should be used to prevent systemic thermal overload.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch6lev3sec5"><h3 class="title">Metabolism</h3>
<p class="noindent">Metabolism is the collective process by which the living status of tissues of the body is maintained. When short-wave diathermy is applied to the body tissue, it produces heat. Heat production in the body tissues increases metabolism. This may occur as per the Van't Hoff statement. Van't Hoff has stated that any chemical change capable of being accelerated by heat is accelerated by rise in temperature.<a name="page175"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">175</span></span></p>
<p class="indent">Due to the increase in temperature, there is an increase in cellular metabolism, which accelerates enzymatic activity and biochemical reactions, leading to heightened metabolic processes within the treated area. Further, the heat energy stimulates cellular activity, leading to an increase in adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production, which fuels metabolic processes. By boosting metabolism, SWD promotes protein synthesis and cellular repair, aiding in the healing of damaged tissues. Enhanced circulation aids in the reduction of metabolic byproducts, thus clearing lactic acid and other byproducts of anaerobic metabolism, and reducing inflammation and pain.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch6lev3sec6"><h3 class="title">Blood Supply</h3>
<p class="noindent">Short-wave diathermy application increases local blood supply. An increase in blood supply may occur due to the direct effect of heat on the vessels in terms of vasodilation. This vasodilation may occur indirectly due to the action of metabolites on the vessel walls. Metabolites and other waste products produced are increased due to the increase in metabolic activity. Due to increased vasodilation, there is an increase in the lumen of the vessels, which leads to increased blood supply. The heat generated by SWD causes the blood vessels to dilate, increasing the diameter of arterioles and capillaries. This vasodilation improves blood flow to the treated area. Enhanced circulation helps deliver oxygen and nutrients more efficiently to the tissues. It also facilitates the removal of waste products, such as carbon dioxide and lactic acid. SWD increases the permeability of capillary walls, aiding in the exchange of fluids, nutrients, and waste products between blood and tissues. The increased blood supply can alleviate ischemic conditions by improving oxygen delivery to areas with compromised blood flow. Increased blood flow supports tissue repair and regeneration by delivering essential growth factors and enzymes to the damaged area. As blood vessels dilate, there may be a transient drop in peripheral resistance, which could slightly lower blood pressure. These effects make SWD useful for chronic inflammatory conditions, tissue healing, and reducing muscle spasm. However, it should be used cautiously in individuals with vascular disorders or circulatory insufficiency.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch6lev3sec7"><h3 class="title">Effect on Nerves</h3>
<p class="noindent">Mild heating due to short-wave diathermy application may reduce the excitability of the nerves, especially sensory nerves.<a name="page176"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">176</span></span></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch6lev3sec8"><h3 class="title">Muscle Relaxation</h3>
<p class="noindent">Rise in temperature induces relaxation of muscles and increase their efficacy of action. The muscle fibers contract and relax very easily, but strength of the contraction is unaffected.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch6lev3sec9"><h3 class="title">Tissue Damage</h3>
<p class="noindent">Excessive heating due to short-wave diathermy application may cause damage to the tissues in the form of coagulation or thermal burns. Hence monitoring and overheating should be avoided during the treatment.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch6lev3sec10"><h3 class="title">Blood Pressure</h3>
<p class="noindent">Prolonged application of short-wave diathermy can reduce blood pressure. This happens due to reduction in peripheral resistance to the flow of blood, which is due to generalized vasodilation and reduction in viscosity of the blood.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch6lev3sec11"><h3 class="title">Sweating</h3>
<p class="noindent">Increase in the local and general temperature can cause increased sweating either in the local region of heating or generalized area, depending on the extent of heating.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch6lev2sec4"><h2 class="title">Therapeutic Effects and Uses</h2>
<div class="section" id="ch6lev3sec12"><h3 class="title">Pain Relief</h3>
<p class="noindent">Short-wave diathermy is one of the effective modalities in relieving musculoskeletal pain. The exact mechanism of pain relief is not known. However, it may occur due to the sedative effect of short-wave diathermy on sensory nerves, counter-irritation by heat, resolution in inflammation, and the relief of underlying muscle spasms. However, in very acute conditions (&lt;72 hours of onset) short-wave diathermy application may increase the pain due to increase in the inflammatory process.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch6lev3sec13"><h3 class="title">Muscle Spasm</h3>
<p class="noindent">Short-wave diathermy can induce muscle relaxation and hence, it can be used in the treatment of muscle spasms.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch6lev3sec14"><h3 class="title">Joint Stiffness</h3>
<p class="noindent">Short-wave diathermy can minimize joint stiffness due to the increased extensibility of connective tissue due to an increase in local temperature and the relief of pain, spasms, and inflammation. Usually, short-wave diathermy is used to treat deep joints where superficial heating modalities may not be effective because of their smaller penetration depth. To make use of this effect, short-wave diathermy should be applied before manual therapy.<a name="page177"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">177</span></span></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch6lev3sec15"><h3 class="title">Inflammation</h3>
<p class="noindent">An increase in the blood supply also increases white blood cells, antibodies, and other essential nutritive materials. An increase in all of these may help in the resolution of inflammation. The short-wave diathermic application can minimize or resolve subacute and chronic inflammation. It may resolve or minimize acute inflammation, provided it is applied at the precise time following the onset of acute inflammation (after 72 hours) with the right dosages, otherwise, it can aggravate the acute inflammatory process.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch6lev3sec16"><h3 class="title">Musculoskeletal Trauma</h3>
<p class="noindent">Short-wave diathermy accelerates healing by increasing the number of nutritive materials required for healing following musculoskeletal trauma.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch6lev2sec5"><h2 class="title">Indications and Contraindications</h2>
<div class="section" id="ch6lev3sec17"><h3 class="title">Indications</h3>

<li><p class=""><bold>Other conditions:</bold> Abscess, inflammation of gallbladder and ducts, peritoneal adhesions, and prostatitis.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch6lev3sec18"><h3 class="title">Contraindications</h3>
<p class="noindent">Short-wave diathermy is contraindicated in the presence of pregnancy, cardiac pacemaker, cochlear implant, neurostimulators or other electronic implants, metal (joint replacements, screws, plates) implants, jewelry, jewelry with body piercing, hemorrhage, during menstrual cycle, over epiphyseal plate in children over growing bones, thrombosis, peripheral vascular diseases, impaired sensations, anesthetic areas, malignancy, following X-ray therapy, epileptic patients, mentally retarded patients, patients who are unable to communicate and those with fever.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch6lev3sec19"><h3 class="title">Precautions</h3>
<p class="noindent">Major precautions should be taken while treating patients with hearing aids, contact lenses and electrophysiological orthoses. In addition to this, follow simple precautionary steps like; avoid using SWD over areas where the patient cannot feel the heat, as it increases the risk of burns, use with caution in individuals with poor blood flow, as tissues may overheat, avoid applying SWD over open wounds, infections, or areas with skin irritation, avoid applying SWD over growing bones, as it may interfere with growth, monitor overheating of fat tissues since fat tissue retains heat, increasing the risk of overheating in obese individuals, ensure the SWD unit is regularly maintained and calibrated to deliver accurate settings, avoid overlapping cables or improper placement, as they may cause burns or uneven heating, begin with a lower intensity and gradually increase, ensuring patient comfort, ensure good electrode contact with the skin to avoid hotspots, remove metallic jewelry, watches, or zippers from the treatment area to prevent heating, SWD can interfere with other electronic devices; ensure they are kept at a safe distance, avoid in areas with bacterial or viral infections, do not use SWD near areas with active bleeding or hematoma, avoid continuous SWD in the acute phase of injury due to potential exacerbation of inflammation, regularly check with the patient about sensations of warmth or discomfort, continuously monitor the treatment area for signs of overheating, burns, or redness, use with caution over areas like elbows, knees, or spine to prevent localized overheating, avoid applying SWD directly over these sensitive areas like eyes, gonads, use caution over the lower abdomen during menstruation to avoid increasing flow or discomfort and record treatment settings, duration, and patient feedback to ensure proper application and safety compliance.<a name="page179"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">179</span></span></p>
<p class="indent">Contact lenses should be removed before the treatment in the vicinity of head, neck and face region. Electrophysiological orthoses and hearing aids can be switched off or removed during the treatment. It is also important to keep transistorized units, such as transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulator (TENS) units, muscle stimulators, phones, mobiles, electronic calculators, electronic watches, interferential therapy unit and electronic traction devices at least 5 to 10 feet away from the short-wave diathermy machine.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch6lev2sec6"><h2 class="title">Dosages of Short-wave Diathermy</h2>
<p class="noindent">In acute conditions, short-wave diathermy is applied for 5 to 10 minutes once or twice daily, and in chronic conditions, it is applied for 20 to 30 minutes. <bold><a href="#ch6fig2" class="ulink-inter">Figure 6.2</a></bold> shows a patient taking short-wave diathermy for the right shoulder. Intensity should be chosen in such a way that it produces mild, comfortable, and perceptible warmth. In other words, it should raise the temperature of the tissues to the safer therapeutic range, which is 40 to 45°C. In the past, the dosages were chosen from four levels. Level I: Unnoticeable heat, level II: Slightly noticeable heat, level III: More noticeable heat, and level IV: Very noticeable heat.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch6lev2sec7"><h2 class="title">Advantages of Short-wave Diathermy</h2>
<p class="noindent">Heat is produced in the body tissue and not transmitted through the skin, localization of heat can be done by careful placement of electrodes, and deep heating is possible.</p>
<div class="figure" id="ch6fig2" data-label="Fig. 6.2"><div class="title"><span class="item-label">Fig. 6.2</span> Short-wave diathermy for right shoulder.</div><img alt="Fig. 6.2" src="/MediumImage/179-1.jpg"><div class="additional-markup"></div></div>
<p class="noindent"><a name="page180"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">180</span></span>There is no discomfort to the patient as high-frequency current of short-wave diathermy does not stimulate sensory and motor nerves and treatment can be controlled precisely. SWD has deeper penetration and allows the therapeutic heating of the deep tissues, it is noninvasive and helps in reduction of pain, spasm and improves blood circulation. SWD also improves extensibility of collagenous tissues has aids in the repair of soft tissues. SWD is particularly beneficial for chronic joint conditions such as osteoarthritis where it helps in reducing stiffness and improves joint function. It is a versatile modality and can be used for various conditions, including: Musculoskeletal injuries (e.g., sprains, strains), arthritis (osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis), chronic inflammatory conditions (e.g., bursitis, tendinitis) and postsurgical rehabilitation. SWD covers a broader area compared to localized heating modalities, making it time-efficient for treating large or multiple areas and the heat facilitates stretching of soft tissues, such as muscles and tendons, which is particularly useful in combination with manual therapy or exercises.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch6lev2sec8"><h2 class="title">Pulsed Short-wave Diathermy</h2>
<p class="noindent">In the pulsed mode of short-wave diathermy, the output of high-frequency current commences and ceases at regular intervals. In other words, the output is applied in the form of a series of short bursts. Pulsed short-wave diathermy is also called pulsed electromagnetic energy, pulsed peak power, diapulse, etc. In the 1930s, pulsed short-wave diathermy was invented, but it became popular after 1950. Pulsed short-wave diathermy produces mainly nonthermal effects. As a result, there is no appreciable heat developed during the treatment. Pulsed short-wave diathermy increases the cellular activity, reabsorption of hematoma, and the repair process. But it reduces inflammation and swelling. Pulsed short-wave diathermy can produce thermal (if sufficient power) and nonthermal effects. Thermal effects include increased local blood flow, relaxation of muscle spasms, improved tissue extensibility, and pain relief. Nonthermal effects (at low average power) include stimulation of tissue repair and regeneration, enhanced cellular activity, anti-inflammatory effects, and promotion of edema reduction.</p>
<p class="indent">Various parameters of pulsed short-wave diathermy include pulse duration, pulse repetition, intensity or pulse peak power, mean power, etc. Pulsed short wave diathermy is indicated in musculoskeletal conditions such as osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, muscle strains and ligament sprains, soft tissue injuries, tendonitis, bursitis, myofascial pain, wound healing, chronic pain conditions, etc.<a name="page181"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">181</span></span> It is contraindicated in implanted electronic devices (e.g., pacemakers), pregnancy, active bleeding or hemorrhage, malignant tumors, acute infections or inflammation, over synthetic implants or metal objects, and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The treatment duration of pulsed short-wave diathermy ranges from 15 to 60 minutes. The <span class="italic">advantages</span> of PSWD are that it is safe for use in areas where thermal effects may be contraindicated, can be applied over clothing and dressings and it has deeper tissue penetration compared to other modalities like ultrasound. Safety precautions for pulsed short-wave diathermy are regular checking of the machine for calibration, avoiding skin burns by proper spacing and intensity settings, and monitoring for patient feedback during the session.</p>
</div>
</div><div class="section" id="ch6lev1sec2"><h1 class="title">MICROWAVE DIATHERMY</h1>
<p class="noindent">Microwave diathermy (MWD) was first introduced into physiotherapy and electrotherapy applications by von Ardenne in 1938. He recognized its potential for delivering deep heat to tissues through high-frequency electromagnetic waves in the microwave spectrum. von Ardenne's work laid the foundation for the development of microwave diathermy as a therapeutic tool, offering advantages over other diathermy modalities such as improved penetration depth and selective heating of tissues with high water content.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="italic">Microwave diathermy is a modality in physiotherapy that uses high-frequency electromagnetic waves in the microwave spectrum to deliver deep heat to tissues</span>. It is an effective therapeutic technique for pain relief, improving circulation, and promoting tissue healing. Microwave diathermy can be defined as the therapeutic use of microwaves for the treatment of various diseases and disorders. Microwave diathermy is also called microthermy. Microwaves are electromagnetic waves with wavelengths in between 1 centimeter and one meter. For physiotherapeutic purpose, high frequency current of 2,450 MHz and wavelength 12.25 cm or 433.92 MHz and 69 cm are used. Considering the electromagnetic spectrum, one can very well note that the wavelength of microwaves lies between infrared and short waves.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch6lev2sec9"><h2 class="title">Production</h2>
<div class="section" id="ch6lev3sec20"><h3 class="title">Principle</h3>
<p class="noindent">It is not possible to produce microwaves by mechanical means and hence, they are produced from magnetron, which is a special type of thermionic valve.<a name="page182"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">182</span></span></p>
<div class="figure" id="ch6fig3" data-label="Fig. 6.3"><div class="title"><span class="item-label">Fig. 6.3</span> Block diagram of microwave diathermy.</div><img alt="Fig. 6.3" src="/MediumImage/182-1.jpg"><div class="additional-markup"></div></div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch6lev3sec21"><h3 class="title">Functional Parts</h3>
<p class="noindent">Microwave diathermy apparatus consists of the following functional parts, power supply, magnetron oscillator circuit, magnetron oscillator, intensity control, coaxial cable and emitter. Power supply unit supplies high voltage pulsed direct current and magnetron oscillator circuit control adequate heating and cooling of magnetron <bold>(<a href="#ch6fig3" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 6.3</a>)</bold>. The primary function of magnetron oscillator is to produce high frequency current required for the production of microwaves. Magnetron is a special type of thermionic valve characterized by centrally placed cathode, which is surrounded by circular type metal anode. The anode has circular cavities that allow the production of circulating or alternating current.</p>
<p class="indent">Coaxial cable carries high frequency currents from magnetron and feeds it to the antenna of the emitter. Now the emitter is also known as director or applicator. The emitter consists of antenna and reflector. Antenna is mounted in front of a metal reflector. Reflector is a metal plate, which directs the waves in only one direction. Emitters are available in various sizes and shapes. The emitter can be kept in contact with the body, if there is internal spacing in it, otherwise it should be kept at a distance of 10 to 20 cm from the body surface to be treated. Intensity knob controls output of the microwave by varying the power supplied to the magnetron.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch6lev2sec10"><h2 class="title">Physiological and Therapeutic Effects</h2>
<p class="noindent">The physiological and therapeutic effects of microwave diathermy are the same as that of short-wave diathermy. However, the amount of heat production is higher in muscles as compared to short-wave diathermy since the heat production by the microwaves depends on the watery content of the tissues. The depth of penetration of microwaves is smaller and ranges between 3 millimeters to 3 centimeter, while in the case of short-wave diathermy, it may be up to 6 centimeters.</p>
<p class="indent">Microwave diathermy <bold>(<a href="#ch6fig3" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 6.3</a>)</bold> can produce thermal effects like increased blood flow, muscle relaxation and reduction of spasms, enhanced tissue extensibility, pain relief through neuromodulation and nonthermal effects like stimulation of cellular repair mechanisms, reduction in inflammation and accelerated wound healing (though primarily thermal effects dominate).<a name="page183"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">183</span></span></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch6lev2sec11"><h2 class="title">Uses and Contraindications</h2>
<p class="noindent">Microwave diathermy is indicated in chronic musculoskeletal pain osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, degenerative arthropathy, spondyloarthropathies, muscle strains, ligament sprains, bursitis, tendonitis, enteropathies, post-traumatic stiffness, fibrosis, scar tissue, chronic pleurisy, chronic bronchitis, chronic sinusitis, chronic adenitis, mastitis, mammary abscess, boils, carbuncles, severe vaginal diseases, severe rectal diseases, diseases of the ear and arthritis of small joints can be treated by microwave diathermy.</p>
<p class="indent">Various contraindications to microwave diathermy applications are in patients with cochlear implants, metallic endoprosthesis in the area to be treated, metallic jewelry in the area of the treatment, electronic implants like a pace maker, cochlear implants, malignant tumors, pregnancy, open wounds, over an area of reduced sensation, acute infection or inflammatory conditions, tuberculosis, thrombosis, ischemia, varicose veins, necrosis, diminished or loss of thermal sensation, recent hemorrhage, and acute inflammation. Microwaves should not be applied into the region of eyes and testes. Precautions should be taken while treating patients with an increased amount of temperature, osteoporotic patients, pregnant women, patients with intrauterine contraceptives and the application in the area of the lower abdomen, during menstruation in females, always tailor the dose to the individual patient's condition and tolerance, start with a lower power and gradually increase based on feedback and avoid over-treatment to minimize the risk of burns or tissue damage.</p>
<p class="indent">The <span class="italic">advantages</span> of microwave diathermy are it has deep penetration, MWD can heat deeper tissues compared to superficial heating methods like hot packs, it can offer selective heating of the tissues, and hence microwaves preferentially heat tissues with high water content, such as muscles and blood vessels and microwave diathermy is a noncontact application and the applicator does not need to touch the skin, reducing the risk of burns. The <span class="italic">disadvantages</span> of microwave diathermy are that it has limited applicability and it is not suitable for all body parts, particularly small or irregularly shaped areas, there is a risk of burns since overheating can occur if improperly applied and it is expensive since MWD equipment is more costly than other diathermy devices.<a name="page184"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">184</span></span></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch6lev2sec12"><h2 class="title">Dosages</h2>
<p class="noindent">Dosages of microwave diathermy are, in acute conditions 5 to 10 minutes and in chronic conditions 20 to 30 minutes with an output, which will produce just perceptible and comfortable warmth. It can be measured and up to 200 watts can be given so as to raise the body tissue temperature in therapeutic range of 40 to 45°C. Following is a guideline <bold>(<a href="#ch6tbl1" class="ulink-inter">Table 6.1</a>)</bold> for the dosimetry for reference only.</p>

</div><div class="section" id="ch6lev1sec3"><h1 class="title">LONG-WAVE DIATHERMY</h1>
<div class="section" id="ch6lev2sec13"><h2 class="title">Overview</h2>
<p class="noindent">Long-wave diathermy <bold>(<a href="#ch6fig4" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 6.4</a>)</bold> was first introduced into electrotherapy by Nikola Tesla in the early 20th century. Tesla, a renowned inventor and electrical engineer, is credited with pioneering the use of high-frequency electrical currents in medical applications. He developed the technology that would later be utilized in diathermy, specifically for its thermal effects in physiotherapy and electrotherapy. While Tesla's work focused on high-frequency currents, long wave diathermy typically refers to the application of low-frequency electromagnetic waves (usually in the range of 1 MHz or lower) to promote deep tissue heating and treat a variety of musculoskeletal conditions, including chronic pain, muscle spasms, and joint stiffness. It was through Tesla's experiments with high-frequency currents, including the application of alternating currents, that diathermy as a therapeutic modality began to take shape, eventually leading to the development of equipment for long wave diathermy in the clinical setting. Long wave diathermy involves the use of low-frequency electromagnetic waves (typically in the range of 1 MHz or below) to produce deep heat within body tissues. The method is primarily used for therapeutic purposes, especially for conditions involving muscle spasms, joint stiffness, and chronic pain. It is effective because it provides deep tissue heating without affecting the superficial layers of the skin.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch6lev2sec14"><h2 class="title">Production and Application</h2>
<p class="noindent">Principle of operation can be described in two steps: Electromagnetic waves generation and heat production.</p>
<div class="figure" id="ch6fig4" data-label="Fig. 6.4"><div class="title"><span class="item-label">Fig. 6.4</span> Long-wave diathermy machine.</div><img alt="Fig. 6.4" src="/MediumImage/185-1.jpg"><div class="additional-markup"></div></div>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p class=""><a name="page186"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">186</span></span><bold>Electromagnetic waves generation:</bold> Long wave diathermy is generated by an oscillator or high-frequency generator that produces low-frequency alternating current. These waves are delivered via electrodes or applicators that are placed on or near the skin over the targeted area. The current passes through the body and causes the molecular oscillation of tissues, leading to heat generation deep within muscles, ligaments, and joints.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Heat generation:</bold> The primary action of long wave diathermy is the conversion of electromagnetic energy into heat, which penetrates the tissue. This heat causes vasodilation, improves circulation, and aids in muscle relaxation by reducing spasm and stiffness.</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="indent">Equipment consists of an electromagnetic generator. It is designed to produce controlled low-frequency electromagnetic fields. They can be powered by alternating current (AC) and generate electromagnetic waves within a specific frequency range. Long wave diathermy requires the use of two or more electrodes, typically made from metal or carbonized rubber that are connected to the long wave diathermy machine. Electrodes are placed on the skin near the area requiring treatment, typically in pairs to complete the electrical circuit. The setup may vary depending on the area being treated and whether the treatment aims to focus on superficial or deep tissue heating. For the treatment application the patient should be comfortably positioned, and the area to be treated should be exposed. Electrode placement is critical to ensure proper coverage and optimal heat penetration. For example, for joint pain, electrodes may be placed on either side of the joint. The long wave diathermy machine is set to the appropriate frequency (usually between 0.5 to 1 MHz) and intensity based on the specific treatment goal. Power settings should be low initially and increased gradually to ensure comfort and avoid burns. Treatment sessions typically last for about 15 to 30 minutes, depending on the condition being treated and the patient's response. It's important to monitor the patient's comfort level and avoid excessive heat that may cause burns or discomfort. After treatment, the patient may experience a warm feeling in the treated area, and it's important to allow time for tissues to cool. Gentle movements or stretches may be recommended post-treatment to maintain flexibility and reduce stiffness.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch6lev2sec15"><h2 class="title">Biological Effects</h2>
<p class="noindent">Long wave diathermy, also known as low-frequency diathermy or microwave therapy, produces several physiological effects on the body. The primary mechanism is the generation of deep heat within the tissues, which leads to various therapeutic benefits and effects. Long wave diathermy effects can be described in terms of thermal and nonthermal effects. <bold>Thermal effects</bold> includes increased tissue temperature, vasodilation, improved metabolism, reduction in muscle spasm, pain relief and increased collagen elasticity.<a name="page187"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">187</span></span></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Increased tissue temperature:</bold> The primary effect of long wave diathermy is the generation of heat in the tissues. This increase in temperature improves blood flow and promotes healing in the treated area.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Vasodilation:</bold> Heat causes the blood vessels to dilate, increasing blood circulation. This promotes the delivery of oxygen and nutrients to tissues while facilitating the removal of metabolic waste products.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Improved tissue metabolism:</bold> Heat enhances the metabolic rate in the treated area, which can help speed up the healing of tissues and reduce pain.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Reduction of muscle spasms:</bold> The heat from diathermy helps relax muscles by reducing muscle spasm and increasing the elasticity of soft tissues. This can improve flexibility and range of motion.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Pain relief:</bold> The heat produced by long wave diathermy can block pain signals to the brain and increase the pain threshold, providing analgesic effects.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Increased collagen elasticity:</bold> Heat helps improve the elasticity of collagen fibers, which can aid in the stretching of tight tissues, improving flexibility and reducing stiffness.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent"><bold>Nonthermal effects</bold> includes enhanced cellular activity, increased lymphatic drainage, stimulation of deep tissues and modification of nerve conduction velocity.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Enhanced cellular activity:</bold> The heat produced by long wave diathermy may increase the activity of fibroblasts, promoting tissue repair and collagen formation, which can help in wound healing and tissue regeneration.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Increased lymphatic drainage:</bold> By promoting vasodilation and improving blood circulation, diathermy can also facilitate the movement of lymph fluid, which aids in reducing edema and improving the removal of waste products.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Stimulation of deep tissues:</bold> Unlike other superficial heating modalities, long wave diathermy can penetrate deeper into tissues, such as muscles, tendons, and ligaments, to provide therapeutic effects in these areas.<a name="page188"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">188</span></span></p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Modification of nerve conduction:</bold> The heat from long wave diathermy can alter nerve conduction, potentially reducing pain and muscle spasms, which can aid in improving motor function.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent"><bold>Other effects</bold> include reduction in inflammation, acceleration of healing and reduced joint stiffness.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Reduction of inflammation:</bold> By increasing circulation, diathermy can promote the removal of inflammatory mediators and decrease swelling, which is beneficial in conditions like tendonitis or arthritis.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Promotion of wound healing:</bold> The increased blood flow and cellular activity facilitate the healing of chronic wounds, soft tissue injuries, or surgical incisions.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Reduced joint stiffness:</bold> By warming the tissues and improving flexibility, diathermy can help reduce joint stiffness and improve mobility, particularly in patients with osteoarthritis or other joint conditions.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent"><bold>Potential negative effects</bold> (if misused) it can cause burns, tissue damage and exacerbation of acute inflammation.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Burns:</bold> If the application time or intensity is too high, there is a risk of burns, especially when the heat is concentrated in one area for a prolonged period.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Tissue damage:</bold> Prolonged exposure to heat can potentially damage tissues, particularly if there is reduced blood flow or if the tissues are already compromised (e.g., in patients with poor circulation).</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Exacerbation of acute inflammation:</bold> While diathermy is useful for chronic conditions, applying heat during the acute stage of an injury (when inflammation is present) can worsen the inflammation and increase pain.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">When used correctly, long wave diathermy can be an effective treatment modality for a variety of musculoskeletal conditions. However, it must be applied carefully, with attention to contraindications, to avoid adverse effects.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch6lev2sec16"><h2 class="title">Indications</h2>
<p class="noindent">Applications in physiotherapy includes:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Pain management:</bold> Long wave diathermy is used to treat chronic pain, especially in conditions like osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Muscle relaxation:</bold> It is effective in reducing muscle spasms and increasing muscle flexibility.<a name="page189"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">189</span></span></p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Tissue healing:</bold> By improving blood circulation and oxygen delivery to tissues, it can promote healing in soft tissue injuries.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Joint stiffness:</bold> It helps in reducing stiffness and improving joint mobility, particularly in conditions like frozen shoulders or postsurgical rehabilitation.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch6lev2sec17"><h2 class="title">Contraindications</h2>
<p class="noindent">Long wave diathermy has several contraindications that must be considered to ensure patient safety. These include:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Pregnancy:</bold> It should not be used on pregnant women, particularly over the abdomen and pelvis, as the heat may potentially harm the fetus.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Pacemakers and implantable electronic devices:</bold> Long wave diathermy can interfere with electronic medical devices like pacemakers, defibrillators, and other implanted devices, which could lead to malfunction or complications.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Malignancies (cancerous tumors):</bold> It is contraindicated in patients with known or suspected cancer, as the heat may promote tumor growth or metastasis.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Acute inflammation or infections:</bold> Using diathermy on areas with acute inflammation, infections, or active bleeding can worsen the condition by increasing blood flow and spreading infection.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Hemorrhagic conditions:</bold> In cases of bleeding disorders or recent hemorrhage (e.g., hemophilia), the heat may exacerbate bleeding and lead to complications.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Metal implants:</bold> Areas where metal implants are present (e.g., orthopedic prosthetics, metal plates, or screws) should be avoided because the heat may cause burns or tissue damage around the metal.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Eyes and sensitive areas:</bold> Long wave diathermy should not be applied to or near the eyes, thyroid gland, or other highly sensitive areas, as they may be more prone to injury from heat exposure.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Over large nerve plexuses:</bold> Diathermy should not be used over areas with large nerve plexuses (such as the brachial or lumbosacral plexus), as prolonged exposure to heat could affect nerve function.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Heart disease or hypertension:</bold> It should be avoided in patients with uncontrolled cardiovascular conditions, as the heat can increase heart rate and blood pressure, potentially exacerbating symptoms.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Pregnant uterus (pelvic region):</bold> Diathermy should not be applied to the pelvic region in women who are pregnant, as heat may negatively affect the developing fetus.<a name="page190"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">190</span></span></p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Tissues with impaired sensitivity:</bold> It should be used cautiously in areas where the patient has reduced or absent sensation, as they may not be able to feel excessive heat buildup and could suffer burns.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Over the abdomen or pelvis in acute conditions:</bold> For patients with acute abdominal or pelvic conditions, long wave diathermy is not recommended due to the risk of aggravating inflammation or causing further tissue damage.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch6lev2sec18"><h2 class="title">Safety Considerations</h2>
<p class="noindent">Safety consideration pertaining to long wave diathermy includes patient monitoring and care must be taken to ensure that the treatment does not overheat the tissues. The therapist should monitor the patient throughout the procedure, always ensure that the skin is free of oils or lotions to avoid excessive heat buildup, and it should not be used over open wounds, active infections, or on patients with metal implants or pacemakers.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch6lev2sec19"><h2 class="title">Advantages</h2>
<p class="noindent">Advantages of long wave diathermy are: It provides therapeutic deep heating and better than treatments like superficial heat, it is effective for chronic conditions particularly in the treatment of chronic musculoskeletal conditions, joint stiffness, and muscle spasms and it promotes circulation and tissue healing by increasing blood flow to the treated area.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch6lev2sec20"><h2 class="title">Disadvantages</h2>
<p class="noindent">Long wave diathermy, also known as low-frequency diathermy or microwave therapy, has several potential disadvantages, including risk of burns since long wave diathermy can cause burns if not used properly, especially when the applicator is in direct contact with the skin or when there is improper power setting. Overheating of tissues can occur with long wave diathermy if the treatment is applied for too long or at too high an intensity, which may result in tissue damage or discomfort. It may not be effective for certain conditions such as deep tissue injuries or inflammations that require specific treatment modalities. Patients with implanted pacemakers, defibrillators, or other electronic medical devices should avoid long wave diathermy due to the risk of interference with these devices. Some patients may experience discomfort or mild pain during or after treatment, especially if the intensity is too high and proper positioning of the electrodes and adjusting the settings for optimal results require skill and experience, which could be challenging for less experienced therapists. Proper training and careful patient assessment are essential to minimize these disadvantages and ensure the safe and effective use of long wave diathermy.<a name="page191"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">191</span></span></p>
</div>
</div><div class="section" id="ch6lev1sec4"><h1 class="title">OUDIN CURRENT</h1>
<p class="noindent">The Oudin current is named after Paul Marie Oudin, a French physician and physicist, who described and developed its application in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Dr Oudin was a pioneer in the field of high-frequency electrotherapy and collaborated with other innovators like Nikola Tesla. Oudin adapted the Tesla coil to create a device that could generate high-frequency currents for therapeutic use. His work focused on dermatological and superficial tissue treatments, significantly contributing to early electrotherapy techniques. The Oudin apparatus became widely used in physiotherapy for its effects on pain relief, circulation improvement, and skin conditions.</p>
<p class="indent">Oudin current is infrequently used nowadays due to the recognition of short-wave diathermy by most of physiotherapists across the world. In general, it is a mono-terminal high-frequency current in the range of a long-wave band. It is often marketed as Heal-O-Ray or just by the name high-frequency unit. It fascinates the therapist as well as the patients. This current may be preferred sometimes in those patients who do not respond to other forms of treatment. These patients like the sparking sound that occurs during the treatment and the pinkish color in the glass electrode <bold>(<a href="#ch6fig5" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 6.5</a>)</bold>. This current is applied through the glass vacuum electrode.</p>
<div class="figure" id="ch6fig5" data-label="Fig. 6.5"><div class="title"><span class="item-label">Fig. 6.5</span> Oudin current applicator electrodes.</div><img alt="Fig. 6.5" src="/MediumImage/191-1.jpg"><div class="additional-markup"></div></div>
<p class="noindent"><a name="page192"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">192</span></span>In administering this current, the glass electrode is held close to the body part that is to be treated. When the current is applied through the electrode, it produces sparks. This produces counter-irritation and hyperemia.</p>
<p class="indent">Oudin current can produce thermal as well as nonthermal effects. <span class="italic">Thermal effects</span> include increased blood flow to the skin and superficial tissues. Enhances oxygen supply and nutrient delivery and relieves muscle tension and pain. <span class="italic">Nonthermal effects</span> include stimulation of superficial nerve endings and improvement of skin tone and healing in dermatological conditions. Indications include chronic pain, muscle spasms, neuralgias, sprains, strains, myositis, sluggish wounds and ulcers, superficial circulation improvement, acne treatment, wrinkle reduction, and superficial skin infections. It is contraindicated in cardiac conditions (e.g., pacemakers, arrhythmias), pregnancy, active infections in the treatment area, malignancy, open wounds or broken skin, and patients with metal implants near the treatment area. One should use this modality with caution since literature about the treatment parameters is not readily available. If this current is applied with high intensity, high frequency, and with very close proximity to the body, it can produce electrodessication.</p>
<p class="indent">The advantages of Oudin current include that it is noninvasive and painless. Produces localized effects with minimal risk of systemic impact and it is versatile, with applications in physiotherapy and dermatology. Disadvantages include its limited penetration depth (primarily superficial tissues), requires specialized equipment and trained personnel and it is not suitable for deep tissue conditions.</p>
</div><div class="section" id="ch6lev1sec5"><h1 class="title">PARAFFIN WAX BATH THERAPY</h1>
<p class="noindent">The paraffin wax bath as a therapeutic modality was first described by James B Mennell, a British physician, in the early 20th century. Mennell is well-known for his contributions to the development and understanding of various physiotherapy techniques, including thermotherapy. Mennell advocated the use of paraffin wax baths for their ability to provide moist heat to joints and soft tissues, particularly in conditions like arthritis and rheumatism. This method gained popularity for its effectiveness in relieving pain, improving joint mobility, and promoting tissue relaxation.</p>
<p class="indent">Treatment of various body parts with melted paraffin wax, whose temperature is maintained at 40 to 44°C, is known as paraffin wax bath therapy. The actual melting point of wax is 51 to 54.4°C. If this melted wax is poured directly on the body tissue, then it may cause thermal injuries and hence, to avoid this, melting point of wax is lowered by the addition of an impurity in the form of paraffin oil. The heat transfer during paraffin wax bath therapy occurs through conduction from the layer of solid paraffin wax into the skin.<a name="page193"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">193</span></span></p>
<div class="section" id="ch6lev2sec21"><h2 class="title">Paraffin Bath Unit</h2>
<p class="noindent">Parts of typical paraffin wax bath unit <bold>(<a href="#ch6fig6" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 6.6</a>)</bold> used in hospital setups are container, mains, thermostat, thermostat pilot lamp, cap and casters. The container is made up of steel. It contains wax and paraffin oil in 6:1 or 7:1 ratio. This ratio is used so that mixture will stay as liquid at the applied temperature. Its function is to maintain wax in melted status. Function of mains is to switch on or off the heating element, which is located in the casing of paraffin wax bath unit. Power pilot function is to show whether power is on or off. Thermostat pilot lamp indicates whether thermostat is on or off. Thermostat keeps the temperature fixed or static in the range, which is adjusted with a knob. The cap covers the container when it is not in use and casters allow the paraffin wax bath container to be moved from one place to another.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch6lev2sec22"><h2 class="title">Clinical Effects and Uses of Paraffin Wax Bath Therapy</h2>
<p class="noindent">Paraffin wax bath can relieve musculoskeletal pain and reduce stiffness. It can increase local temperature, sweating, local circulation and the pliability of skin. Clinically, paraffin wax bath therapy is used in the treatment of osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, tenosynovitis, joints stiffness, leprosy, scleroderma, Dupuytren's contracture, Sudeck's atrophy and various soft tissue contractures.</p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="ch6lev2sec23"><h2 class="title">Contraindications</h2>
<p class="noindent">Paraffin wax bath therapy is contraindicated in presence of open wounds, since it may enter in the wound and act as a foreign body and delay healing. Infective conditions should not be treated by paraffin wax bath as it may increase the inflammatory process. Allergic rashes, deep vein thrombosis, impaired sensations and skin conditions like, acute dermatitis should not be treated with paraffin wax bath therapy.</p>

<p class="noindent">The dip method provides mild heating. The patient should wash and dry the part to be treated. The therapist instructs the patient to dip the body part in the bath and then remove it until the paraffin solidifies, and a thin layer of adherent solid paraffin is formed which covers the skin. Dipping is repeated until a thick coat is formed. In other words, at least 8 to 12 times until the wax has formed a thick glove over the part. Once the thick glove of wax is formed, the treated area should be wrapped first in plastic and then wrapped over with a towel. If edema is a concern, then the area may be elevated. The effective duration of this treatment is 10 to 15 minutes. At the end of this treatment, the glove of solid wax is peeled off or removed by slipping a finger beneath the glove and sliding the wax off and into the plastic sack, which covered it during the treatment. The sack is then discarded or the wax is emptied into the bath unit.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch6lev3sec23"><h3 class="title">Immersion Method</h3>
<p class="noindent">Immersion method of application provides somewhat vigorous heating. The body part to be treated is dipped three to four times to form a thin coat and then left immersed in paraffin for 20 to 30 minutes. A thin glove of solid paraffin wax formed, slows the heat conduction. Use of the immersion method requires cooperation and tolerance by the patient in a dependent position. Care should be taken to ensure that the patient is in a comfortable position during the treatment. With the immersion method, the temperature elevation of the body tissue is 2°C higher than the dipping method.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch6lev3sec24"><h3 class="title">Brush Method</h3>
<p class="noindent">Brush method is a less commonly used method of paraffin wax application. In this method, 8 to 10 coats of wax are applied to the area with a paint brush using even and rapid strokes. The area is then wrapped with towel for 10 to 20 minutes and after this time paraffin wax is removed and discarded.<a name="page195"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">195</span></span></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch6lev3sec25"><h3 class="title">Bandage Method</h3>
<p class="noindent">In this method, bandage of a suitable size and mesh is soaked in hot wax and then it is wrapped around the limb. Additional wax then can be poured or brushed over the bandage.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch6lev2sec25"><h2 class="title">Technique of Application</h2>
<p class="noindent">Explain the procedure, expose the body part to be treated, remove the jewelry, check the sensation, check for contraindications, inspect the body part to be treated before, ensure the comfortable position of the patient, check the temperature selected on thermostat before treatment, double check or recheck by inserting finger into the bath. Use any method of application which is convenient for you and your patient, and apply paraffin wax, inspect the body part treated after the treatment is done.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch6lev2sec26"><h2 class="title">Maintenance of Paraffin Wax Bath Unit</h2>
<p class="noindent">Sterilize the paraffin wax bath unit by heating it to 212°F or as directed by the manufacturer. For reuse, sterilization should be done frequently. Drain the melted paraffin wax, filter it out and replace it back for reuse. Change the wax at least once in 6 months.</p>
</div>
</div><div class="section" id="ch6lev1sec6"><h1 class="title">HOT PACKS</h1>
<p class="noindent">The <bold>hydrocollator hot pack</bold> was probably first introduced in physiotherapy in 1947 by the Chattanooga Pharmaceutical Company (now Chattanooga Group, a major manufacturer of rehabilitation and physical therapy equipment). It was developed as a method for providing moist heat therapy, which is highly effective for reducing pain, improving circulation, and relaxing muscles. While moist heat had been used for centuries in various forms (e.g., hot compresses, Kenny packs), the hydrocollator system standardized the process by introducing a thermostatically controlled heating unit and reusable silica gel-filled packs. This innovation allowed for consistent, long-lasting, and effective moist heat applications in clinical settings.</p>
<p class="indent">Hot pack is one of the superficial heating agents used for thermotherapy. They are used to alleviate muscle spasm, increase range of movement, and for pain relief. However, hot packs should not be used in an area of impaired sensation, recent hemorrhage, open wounds and impaired circulation.<a name="page196"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">196</span></span></p>
<div class="section" id="ch6lev2sec27"><h2 class="title">Physiological and Therapeutic Effects</h2>
<div class="section" id="ch6lev3sec26"><h3 class="title">Local Temperature</h3>
<p class="noindent">Rise in local body temperature occurs following hot packs application. It is due to the conduction of heat from hot pack to the skin and superficial tissues. The increase of body temperature is expected to be &lt;45°C otherwise tissue burn will occur. This rise of temperature is proportional to the area of tissue exposed and the temperature of the hot pack.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch6lev3sec27"><h3 class="title">Circulation</h3>
<p class="noindent">Increase in tissue temperature is associated with vasodilation. As a result of vasodilation, local increase in the blood supply, especially in superficial tissue is likely to occur. It may be manifested by hyperemia. Vasodilation may be due to release of chemical mediators, local spinal cord reflex and cutaneous thermoreceptor.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch6lev3sec28"><h3 class="title">Pain Relief</h3>
<p class="noindent">Hot packs can be used to obtain analgesia. Pain relief following hot pack application may occur due to decreased nerve conduction velocity or elevated pain threshold. It may be due to sedative or counter-irritation effect by heat. Pain relief may occur due to relief of muscle spasm if pain is associated with muscle spasm.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch6lev3sec29"><h3 class="title">Muscle Spasm</h3>
<p class="noindent">Hot pack can bring about the relief of muscle spasm, but the exact mechanism is unknown. It may be due to decreased alpha motor neuron firing as a result of reduced muscle spindle activity.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch6lev3sec30"><h3 class="title">Connective Tissue Extensibility</h3>
<p class="noindent">Hot packs may increase the extensibility of connective tissues. It is due to the effect of heat on the elastic tissues. This effect is more if it is combined with stretching.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch6lev2sec28"><h2 class="title">Types of Hot Packs</h2>
<div class="section" id="ch6lev3sec31"><h3 class="title">Hydrocollator Packs</h3>
<p class="noindent">Hydrocollator packs provide superficial moist heat. The commercial hot packs consist of canvas bags. These bags are filled with silicate gel <bold>(<a href="#ch6fig7" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 6.7</a>)</bold> or some other hydrophilic substance. They are stored in a thermostatically controlled water bath inside equipment <bold>(<a href="#ch6fig8" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 6.8</a>)</bold>. Inside the bath, it absorbs the water with its high heat content. Hydrocollator packs are available in a variety of sizes and shapes and should be chosen on the basis of size and contours of the body part to be treated. The temperature of packs when applied should be in between 70 to 75°C so that it raises the body tissue temperature to 40 to 45°C during the treatment period.<a name="page197"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">197</span></span></p>
<div class="figure" id="ch6fig7" data-label="Fig. 6.7"><div class="title"><span class="item-label">Fig. 6.7</span> Silicate gel pack.</div><img alt="Fig. 6.7" src="/MediumImage/197-1.jpg"><div class="additional-markup"></div></div>
<div class="figure" id="ch6fig8" data-label="Fig. 6.8"><div class="title"><span class="item-label">Fig. 6.8</span> Hydrocollator machine.</div><img alt="Fig. 6.8" src="/MediumImage/197-2.jpg"><div class="additional-markup"></div></div>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Technique:</span> Explain the procedure to the patient, expose the body part to be treated, and check the thermal sensation (remember with SEE, S for sensation, E for expose, and E for explanation). Position the patient. Lift the hydrocollator pack with scissor forceps from the hot pack machine. Wrap it in a dry terry towel; usually, six to eight layers of towel are used to wrap the hydrocollator pack. Place the pack wrapped in a towel over the area of treatment, so that it will cover the treatment area adequately. Do not secure it tightly so that the patient can remove it if it becomes too hot. Ask the patient about sensation, it should be mild and perceptible warmth, and disregard the patient's feeling ‘hotter the better.’<a name="page198"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">198</span></span></p>
<p class="indent">Continue the treatment for 20 minutes and adjust the dosimetry by varying the thickness of the terry towel which in turn slows down the heat transfer. If the patient feels too hot, then increase the toweling layer or remove the hydrocollator pack. Advise the patient not to lie with body weight on the hydrocollator pack, since it may squeeze the water; decrease circulation, and thereby dissipate the heat. The advantages of hot packs are; ease of application, it offers comfortable heat and it is relatively inexpensive from a purchase and maintenance point of view. However, the disadvantage of hot packs is; that there is no temperature control once applied to the patient. It is sometimes awkward to secure it in place, on a patient. Hot packs do not retain heat longer than 20 minutes, it is a passive form of the treatment and does not require any active participation by the patient.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch6lev3sec32"><h3 class="title">Hot Water Bag</h3>
<p class="noindent">The rubber bags containing hot water can be used in the same fashion as like hydrocollator packs. Usually, hot water bags are advised for home treatment. The advantages of a hot water bag are that it is affordable and easy to use, portable and reusable, and provides immediate relief for chronic pain and muscle tightness. Disadvantages of hot water bag are that it is limited to superficial heating, there is a risk of burns if misused and it is not suitable for acute injuries or inflammation.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch6lev3sec33"><h3 class="title">Kenny Packs</h3>
<p class="noindent">Kenny's hot pack was developed by Sister Elizabeth Kenny, an Australian nurse, in the early 20th century as part of her treatment for polio and musculoskeletal conditions. It involves the use of hot, moist packs applied to affected areas to alleviate pain, improve mobility, and reduce muscle spasms. Kenny pack consists of a woolen cloth, which is steered and then surplus water content is removed by spinning. The relatively dry pack is then applied quickly to the skin. It is usually applied at a temperature of 60°C. As it contains little water, it has a little heat carrying capacity and the temperature drops down suddenly to normal level within 5 minutes but the pack is applied for 20 to 30 minutes and can be repeated after 2 to 3 hours. It is a short-term but vigorous heating application, which produces a marked reflex response. Originally, it was used for polio management but I can also be used to reduce muscle spasticity and pain, muscle spasms and stiffness, chronic joint conditions (e.g., arthritis), post-immobilization stiffness and soft tissue injuries in the subacute or chronic stages.<a name="page199"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">199</span></span></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch6lev3sec34"><h3 class="title">Chemical Hot Packs</h3>
<p class="noindent">Chemical hot packs are recently available for therapeutic applications. The chemical hot packs are portable. These packs are flexible container bag-like structures in which by moving the container a compartment is broken. This allows ingredients to get mixed or come together and produce an elevation of temperature by an exothermic reaction. All these packs are poorly controlled. Ingredients are irritating or harmful when the outer pack breaks and the content comes in contact with the skin. Hence, this type of application is the least advantageous.</p>

</div><div class="section" id="ch6lev1sec7"><h1 class="title">ELECTRICAL HEATING PADS</h1>
<p class="noindent">An electrical heating pad is a device that uses electricity to generate heat for therapeutic purposes. It is a popular modality in physiotherapy for relieving pain, reducing muscle spasms, and promoting relaxation. Unlike moist heat methods like hot packs or hydrocollators, electrical heating pads provide dry heat directly to the targeted area.</p>
<p class="indent">The electrical heating pad was first introduced as a therapeutic device in the early 20th century, coinciding with advancements in electricity and electrotherapy. However, its widespread application in physiotherapy was largely popularized by developments in thermotherapy during the 1920s and 1930s. While no single individual is credited with the invention specifically for physiotherapy, the early use of electrical heating pads in medical applications is linked to advancements in electric heating technologies pioneered by inventors like George A Hughes, who patented an early version of the electric heating pad in 1912. These devices were later adapted for use in clinical and therapeutic settings. By the mid-20th century, electrical heating pads became a standard tool in physiotherapy practices, recognized for their convenience, adjustable temperature settings, and effectiveness in delivering dry heat for musculoskeletal and chronic pain conditions.<a name="page200"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">200</span></span></p>
<p class="indent">An electrical heating pad is a form of superficial heating agent and it can be advised to the patients for their home treatment. The advantages of electrical heating pads are: They are cheaper, and flexible, a patient can control the heat during the treatment through a knob and they provide comfortable heat. The components of an electrical heating pad are a heating element, covering material, therapeutic control, and a power source. Heating element: Conducts electricity to produce heat, covering material made of soft, heat-resistant fabric for comfort, temperature control: Adjustable settings allow the user to control the intensity of heat and power source: Typically plugged into a wall outlet or powered by rechargeable batteries in portable models.</p>
<p class="indent">However, the patient should remain awake during the treatment with the electrical heating pad, as there is a possibility that the patient may go to sleep during the treatment and will get up to find a thermal burn. The temperature elevation occurs through the conduction of the heat from the heating pad to the body tissues where the electrical heating pad is applied. This can be used as an adjunct to diathermy especially when diathermy machine goes out of order or for home visits.</p>

<div class="sidebar"><h2 class="title">Summary</h2>
<p class="">Short-wave diathermy is the most commonly used physiotherapeutic modality for deep heating. Advantage of short-wave diathermy is that the heat is produced in the body tissue and not transmitted through the skin. Pulsed short-wave diathermy produces nonthermal effects mainly, physiological effects and therapeutic effects. Uses of the microwave diathermy are same as that of the short-wave diathermy. Precautions should be taken while treating patients with increased temperature, osteoporotic patients, pregnant women, patients with intrauterine contraceptives, and female patients in the area of the lower abdomen during menstruation. Oudin current is used rarely and when applied through the glass electrode, it produces sparking. The heat transfer during paraffin wax bath therapy occurs through conduction from the layer of solid paraffin wax into the skin. Infective conditions should not be treated by paraffin wax bath as it may increase inflammatory process. Hot pack is one of the superficial heating agents and increases the local temperature on its application. Electrical heating pads are cheaper, flexible and can be used by the patient at home.</p>
