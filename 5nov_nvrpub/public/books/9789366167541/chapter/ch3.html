</div><p class="noindent">Well, you might have wondered to see a chapter on the history of electrotherapy in this book. I always tell my students about the importance of knowing the history of the subject. I feel that one's knowledge is always incomplete without knowing it. The knowledge that history, helps us in knowing the subject in depth and philosophically, it is also said that when one is aware of where it came from, then the mistakes done by others will not be repeated. Here is the gist of the historical aspects of electrotherapy. In 1646, renowned physicist, <bold>Sir Thomas Browne</bold>, used the word ‘Electricity’ for the first time. <bold>Aetius</bold>, a Greek physician had prescribed the shocks of Torpedo, an electric fish for the treatment of gout. By 1780, <bold>Luigi Galvani,</bold> a professor of anatomy at the University of Bologna, first observed the quick twitching of the muscle, produced by electricity in a nerve muscle preparation of the frog's leg. History records that the famous French physicist, <bold>Abbe Nollet</bold> administered shock from Leyden jar to 180 royal guards simultaneously in presence of the King. <bold>Johann Gottlob Kruger</bold>, professor of Medicine at Halle, Germany, gave a series of lectures to medical students in 1743 entitled ‘Thoughts about the Electricity’. These were published in 1744, enlarged by notes and reprinted the following year. It was the first book on medical electricity, although the subsequent book written by his pupil, <bold>Christian Gottlieb Kratzenstein</bold> and published in 1745, was the first to use Medical Electricity in its title.<a name="page56"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">56</span></span></p><div class="figure" id="ch3fig1" data-label="Fig. 3.1"><div class="title"><span class="item-label">Fig. 3.1</span> Timeline of electrotherapy history.</div><img alt="Fig. 3.1" src="/MediumImage/56-1.jpg"><div class="additional-markup"></div></div><p class="indent"><bold>Richard Lovett</bold> in England, treated many persons with static shocks and published a treatise in 1756, describing the numerous conditions for which electrotherapy was to be recommended. <bold>John Wesley</bold>, the religious leader became interested in his work and published his own experiences on the subject in 1759, in the book entitled ‘The Desideratum’. <bold>Bertholon</bold> described his techniques with its role in the cure of eight paralytics. In 1768, an electrotherapy instrument was installed at Middlesex Hospital in London. The electrical department established at Guys Hospital in London is now historically recognized as the first hospital with a fully-fledged physical therapy department. Electrotherapy received another boost when renowned physician, <bold>S Weir Mitchell</bold>, endorsed exercises of muscles by faradic stimulation. Surprisingly, I came to know that, once upon a time, electrotherapy was supposed to be a part of radiology. This was told to me by professor Nayak, honorary professor of radiology, JN Medical College, Belgaum. Of course, later on, I got a similar reference from one of the textbooks on this matter by a Philippine-based author.</p><p class="indent">It is interesting to note that due to many similarities, the development of radiology and electrotherapy paralleled each other. Electrical machines were placed alongside X-ray machines in hospitals. By 1919, physiotherapy became an adjunct of radiology, in the years prior to and immediately after Second World War.</p><p class="indent">The timeline of electrotherapy is summarized in the <bold><a href="#ch3fig1" class="ulink-inter">Figure 3.1</a></bold>.</p><div class="section" id="ch3lev1sec1"><h1 class="title">MUSCLE-NERVE STIMULATION</h1>
<p class="noindent">In 1780, <bold>Luigi Galvani</bold> (<bold><a href="#ch3fig2" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 3.2</a></bold>), Professor of Anatomy at the University of Bologna, first observed the twitching of frog's leg muscles by electricity.<a name="page57"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">57</span></span></p>

<p class="noindent">Twenty years later, <bold>Volta</bold> proved that this was due to a sudden make of the current flow in an electric cell. In 1831, <bold>Faraday</bold> discovered induction or faradic coil. The man who probably did the most to place electrotherapy on a scientific level clinically was, <bold>Guillaume Benjamin Amand.</bold></p>
<p class="indent"><bold>Duchenne of Bologna</bold>, who in 1855 described its application for electrical stimulation of muscles and recommended the localized application of Faradic current in the treatment of muscle atrophy. <bold>Remak was the first to demonstrate the motor points for accurate electrical testing of muscles. Du Bois Reymond</bold> in 1849, formulated the law of electrical muscle and nerve stimulation and first used the induction coil for muscles stimulation. <bold>Leduc</bold> introduced an interrupted direct current.</p>
<p class="indent">In 1934, <bold>Morris</bold> reasoned out that denervated muscle will not contract, unless the stimulus last for about 100 milliseconds. <bold><a href="#ch3fig3" class="ulink-inter">Figure 3.3</a></bold> shows one of the earliest nerve stimulator equipment.</p>
</div><div class="section" id="ch3lev1sec2"><h1 class="title">IONTOPHORESIS</h1>
<p class="noindent">The idea of driving the drugs in the body through the skin by means of electric current, was advanced by <bold>Private</bold> in 1747. For many years, iodide remained the favorite for trial introduction, as its recovery through the urine was conclusive. In 1888, <bold>Erb</bold> recovered electrically driven iodide from the saliva and urine of the patient. In the same year, <bold>Arrhenius</bold> published his thesis on electrolytic dissociation and the process had been incorrectly termed ionization since then until the end of Second World War.<a name="page58"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">58</span></span> During the last decade of the nineteenth century, <bold>Ensch</bold> scooped a weal out of a potato and filled it with a solution of potassium iodide. He then applied wires into each side of the potato and passed the current through it. Starch in the potato turned blue at the positive pole. The experiment was popularized by <bold>Schazki</bold> of Russia and was possibly the most quoted work on the new start of therapeutic ion transfer. <bold>Stephane Leduc</bold> of France proposed a unit of the dosage, as one milliampere per square centimeter of electrode surface. In addition to this, hydroelectric baths were first advocated by <bold>Sere</bold>.</p>
</div><div class="section" id="ch3lev1sec3"><h1 class="title">HIGH-FREQUENCY CURRENTS</h1>
<p class="noindent">Historically, treatment with high-frequency current was also called as electro pyrexia, thermopenetration, transthermy, heating through, etc. In 1842, American physicist <bold>Joseph Henry</bold> observed that the discharges from the Leyden jar condenser were of oscillating character. By 1892, <bold>Arsene D’ Arsonval</bold> of Paris developed an apparatus capable of producing high-frequency currents of several thousand oscillations per second and was the first person to study the effect of high-frequency currents on humans. In 1891, <bold>Nikola Tesla</bold> in the United States, observed the heating action of high-frequency current.</p>
<p class="indent">In 1899, <bold>Von Zeyneck</bold> published a paper that briefly mentioned about <span class="italic">‘Durch warming’ or ‘Heating through’</span> of his fingertips when an alternating current passed through them. In 1907, <bold>Zyneck</bold> of Germany with Austrians, <bold>Preyss, and Berend</bold> used high-frequency currents on animals. They also treated Gonorrheal arthritis with an apparatus producing damped oscillations and named this method of treating as term penetration. In 1908, <bold>Nagel Schmidt</bold> in Berlin made experiments independently and named the method as transthermy, later on changing it to diathermy. Thus, Nagel Schmidt was the first person to coin the word diathermy and also demonstrated a more powerful form of it, which left no doubt about the deep heating effects of high-frequency current. Diathermy reached its greatest popularity in 1929 when the King of England, who had worsened on ultraviolet ray treatment, was improved by diathermy.</p>
<p class="indent">Microwave diathermy was the sequence of the development of radar during the Second World War. In 1928, <bold>AW Hull</bold> invented the magnetron. <bold>Hallman</bold> of Germany and his associates did the first study on the biological effects of continuously emitted microwaves. By 1946, <bold>Frank H Krusen</bold> and his coworkers reported the first clinical microwave heating. By the end of the eighteenth century, <bold>Spallanzani</bold> recognized the existence of sound, inaudible to the human ear. <bold>Pierre Curie</bold> found one of the best methods of producing ultrasound waves with the quartz crystal. By 1910, <bold>Langevin</bold> of France produced the first piezoelectric generator for the practical use of ultrasound.<a name="page59"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">59</span></span></p>
</div><div class="section" id="ch3lev1sec4"><h1 class="title">PHOTOTHERAPY</h1>
<p class="noindent">Until the seventeenth century, people had difficulty in describing the colors. Some thought that when light passed through a red glass it emerged as red since it was dyed by the glass. In 1801, Johann Wilhelm Ritter named the invisible rays beyond the violet as ‘ultravioletten’. At that time, the measurement of the wavelength had not yet been fully developed, and Ritter used the word ‘ultra’, which means beyond. Since ultraviolet rays are below, it would have been more accurate to use the term ‘infraviolet’. By remarkable coincidence, a similar error was made by Herschel, a year before, in labeling the red rays as ‘infrared’. In 1868, Anders Jonas Angstrom, a Swedish physicist mapped out the wavelength of the invisible spectrum and published his results. Then the old unit of the wavelength of measurement was named in his honor as ‘Angstrom unit’. At the beginning of the twentieth century, the work of Bernhard and Rollier focused on the use of ultraviolet rays in the treatment of extrapulmonary tuberculosis. By 1910, electrically produced ultraviolet generator became commercially available. With the popularity of ultraviolet rays, it was easier for the manufacturers to convert the ultraviolet lamps to infrared burners and soon they started promoting them as superior to ultraviolet lamps. However, JH Kellogg gave the impetus for the use of infrared rays. In 1981, Kellogg built a device similar to heat cradle or baker with 40 lamps of 20 candlepower.</p>
</div><div class="section" id="ch3lev1sec5"><h1 class="title">MEDICAL USE OF ELECTRICITY</h1>
<p class="noindent">After Galvani's experiments, Humboldt then proposed the question: <span class="italic">“Can galvanism recall a person to his life who has just died?”</span> This question obviously raised snickers among many physicians then, but it is of interest to note that a century and a half later it is used for just that purpose. Today, electric defibrillators are used in cardiac arrest, and electric implants are used for the stimulation of the phrenic nerve in diaphragmatic paralysis, as those seen in poliomyelitis.</p>
<p class="indent">Some of the interesting <bold>historical electrotherapy</bold> includes electro-sleep therapy, cranial electrotherapy stimulation etc.<a name="page60"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">60</span></span></p>
<div class="section" id="ch3lev2sec1"><h2 class="title">Electro-Sleep Therapy</h2>
<p class="noindent">Electro-sleep therapy (EST) is one the treatment option used as a part of sleep medicine. It is a version of the TENS treatment aimed at the patient's general relaxation. Around the head, electrodes are positioned; usually, two are on the eyelids and two more are on the mastoideus areas behind the ears. The electrodes are occasionally positioned on either side of the forehead or even on the ear lobes in place of the eyelids. Thick layers of moist cotton wool are positioned between the electrodes and the skin to guarantee adequate adherence, particularly on the eyelids. Although it has little to do with the electro-sleep mode of action, eye electrodes are typically used in pairs with mastoideus electrodes to allow currents to pass through the brain. This helps to control current intensities so that vibrations are felt equally strongly on both eyelids. Bipolar impulse, impulse width 150–300 μs, frequency 3–20 Hz, and pulse amplitude are preferred current parameters. Each should be carefully adjusted to maintain stimulation between the pain threshold and perception thresholds without modulation. Similar to a boring train rumbling, these settings guarantee monotonous stimulation, which promotes drowsiness and relaxation. The electro sleep devices are consequently fitted with preprogrammed timers so that the patient does not need to be awakened up. Electro sleep sessions typically last between 45 and 90 minutes, however it is best to leave the patient asleep after the stimulation is turned off. Although 15 to 20 sessions are often included in the course of treatment, they can be repeated after a week.</p>

<div class="section" id="ch3lev2sec2"><h2 class="title">Cranial Electrotherapy Stimulation</h2>
<p class="noindent">Cranial electrotherapy stimulation (CES) is a noninvasive stimulation technique that uses small electrodes typically attached on both ear lobes, maxilla-occipital junction, mastoid processes, or temples to send a low level (&lt;1 mA or &lt;4 mA), pulsed electrical current. It is recommended for treatment of anxiety, insomnia, and depression, the precise mechanism of action remains unknown. Currently, there is a paucity of controlled trial evidence supporting CES for PTSD.</p>

<div class="section" id="ch3lev2sec3"><h2 class="title">Apparatus</h2>
<p class="noindent">Electrotherapy equipment has historically included the electric bath for high-voltage static induction, Oudin coil, a high-voltage induction coil, Faradic battery, a device to provide localized electric stimulation, Pulvermacher's chain, a wearable electrochemical device mostly used by quacks, in use second half of 19th century Leyden jars, an early form of capacitor, for storing electricity and electrostatic generators of various sorts.<a name="page61"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">61</span></span></p>
<div class="section" id="ch3lev3sec1"><h3 class="title">Electric Bath</h3>
<p class="noindent">It is a 19th-century medical treatment in which a high-voltage electrical apparatus was used to electrify patients by causing an electric charge to build up in their bodies. The process became widely known after Franklin described it in the mid-18th century, but after that, it was mostly practiced by quacks. The source of electricity for an electric bath was usually a frictional machine. The patient was seated on a wooden stool, and both the patient and the stool were insulated from the ground by a platform on glass legs or some other insulator. In some arrangements, the patient was lying down rather than seated. The patient was then charged with static electricity either by direct connection to one electrode of the generator (usually the positive), or else through electrostatic induction by holding a large electrode close to the patient's body. The electric tension applied was around 30–50 and treatment could take several hours. Following charging the patient was “bathed” in electricity, hence the name of the procedure. This can be observed in a darkened room as a luminous discharge around the patient, especially at the hair and extremities. The electric bath treatment was painless, but it caused the patient to warm and sweat, and the heart rate to increase. It also caused the hair to stand on end. The electric bath could form a treatment. It could also be the first stage in further treatment. A common procedure was to draw sparks from the patient after charging, especially from the spine.</p>

<div class="section" id="ch3lev3sec2"><h3 class="title">Oudin Coil</h3>
<p class="noindent">Also called an <span class="italic">Oudin oscillator</span> or <span class="italic">Oudin resonator</span>, is a resonant transformer circuit that generates very high voltage, high frequency alternating current (AC) electricity at low current levels used in the obsolete forms of electrotherapy around the turn of the 20th century. It is very similar to the Tesla coil, with the difference being that the Oudin coil was connected as an autotransformer. It was invented in 1893 by French physician Paul Marie Oudin and used in medical diathermy therapy. The high-voltage output terminal of the coil was connected to an insulated handheld electrode which produced luminous brush discharges, which were applied to the patient's body to treat various conditions. The high voltage terminal of the coil was attached through a wire to various types of handheld electrodes which the physician used to apply the high voltage to the patient's body. The treatment was not painful for the patient.<a name="page62"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">62</span></span></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch3lev3sec3"><h3 class="title">Faradic Battery</h3>
<p class="noindent">A <span class="italic">Faradic battery</span> or <span class="italic">Galvanic battery</span> was a device used in early 20th-century electrotherapy practice, and it was intended to create a mild electric shock that was thought to be therapeutic, to assist with ailments around nerve sensitivity within muscles and bones. Many machines were portable for use at a physician's clinic or at the house for allegedly little actual benefit and providing more of a placebo effect during those times.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch3lev3sec4"><h3 class="title">Pulvermacher Chain</h3>
<p class="noindent">The <span class="italic">Pulvermacher chain</span>, or <span class="italic">Pulvermacher hydro-electric chain</span>, a type of voltaic battery was sold in the second half of the 19th century for medical treatments. Its unique selling point was its construction of numerous linked cells, rendering it mechanically flexible. A variant intended to be worn wrapped on parts of the body for long periods was known as Pulvermacher's galvanic chain or electric belt. Later variation of this was the wearable Boston electric belt although electric belts were made for every conceivable part of the human anatomy: Limbs, abdomen, chest, neck—sometimes all worn at the same time. Pulvermacher even had a model designed to attach to the male genitals in a special sac which was claimed to cure impotence and erectile dysfunction. Pulvermacher promoted a theory that loss of male vigor in later life was a consequence of masturbation in early life and that a limited supply of semen, which provided the vigor, would run out before time if wasted. Pulvermacher's device was meant to address this shortcoming.</p>
