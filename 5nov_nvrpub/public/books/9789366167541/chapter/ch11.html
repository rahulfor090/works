<p class="noindent">Clinical decision-making in electrotherapy involves selecting appropriate modalities and treatment parameters to achieve desired therapeutic outcomes. It requires the integration of clinical knowledge, patient assessment, evidence-based practice, and patient preferences. This process is essential for safe, effective, and personalized treatment in physiotherapy. One can easily decide about which modality should be chosen in a particular instance, but the real art lies not in selecting the modality but in selecting it so that it fetches a positive outcome. Several modalities are available and each one of them can reduce the amount of discomfort that a patient may be experiencing. There is an overlap of clinical effects and results of these modalities. The questions like what should I choose? When should I choose? How should I choose? Should I follow the same sequence again? and so on, arise during clinical situations. Given below are some comments that may help you in clinical decision-making. But remember that whatever you think is right for your patient, you should try to follow the same.<a name="page269"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">269</span></span></p>
<div class="section" id="ch11lev2sec1"><h2 class="title">Key Components</h2>
<p class="noindent">Key components of clinical decision-making are:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Medical history:</bold> Identify the patient's diagnosis, comorbidities, and contraindications to electrotherapy. Consider conditions such as pacemakers, epilepsy, pregnancy, or metal implants.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Pain assessment:</bold> Evaluate the type, location, intensity, and duration of pain using tools like the visual analog scale (VAS).</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Functional impairment:</bold> Assess muscle strength, range of motion (ROM), sensation, and functional limitations.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Skin condition:</bold> Inspect the skin for wounds, infections, scars, or sensitivity that could influence electrode placement or current application.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Setting treatment goals:</bold> Clearly define the desired outcomes based on the patient's condition and needs. Common goals include:
<ul style="list-style-type: square">
<li><p class="">Pain relief (e.g., using TENS or IFC).</p></li>
<li><p class="">Muscle strengthening (e.g., using NMES).</p></li>
<li><p class="">Improved circulation (e.g., using HVPC or ultrasound).</p></li>
<li><p class="">Reduction of edema (e.g., using microcurrent or galvanic stimulation).</p></li>
<li><p class="">Tissue healing (e.g., using laser therapy or low-frequency currents).</p></li></ul></p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Selection of electrotherapy modality:</bold> Choose the most appropriate modality based on the therapeutic goals and patient-specific factors:
<ul style="list-style-type: square">
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS):</span> Pain modulation.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES):</span> Muscle strengthening and re-education.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Interferential curren (IFC)):</span> Deep pain relief and reduction of swelling.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">High voltage pulsed current (HVPC):</span> Wound healing and edema reduction.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Ultrasound therapy:</span> Tissue healing and reduction of inflammation.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Iontophoresis:</span> Drug delivery for localized inflammation or pain.</p></li></ul></p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Parameter selection:</bold> Adjust the parameters of the chosen modality to align with the treatment goals:
<ul style="list-style-type: square">
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Intensity (amplitude):</span> Choose a comfortable yet effective level, avoiding discomfort or pain.<a name="page270"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">270</span></span></p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Frequency:</span>
<ul style="list-style-type: diamond">
<li><p class="">Low frequency (1–20 Hz): Tissue healing and relaxation.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Medium frequency (20–50 Hz): Muscle contraction and edema management.</p></li>
<li><p class="">High frequency (50–100 Hz): Pain relief and stimulation of sensory nerves.</p></li></ul></p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Duration:</span> Shorter sessions for acute conditions, longer for chronic conditions (typically 10–30 minutes).</p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Waveform:</span> Monophasic, biphasic, or polyphasic based on the modality and target tissue.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Electrode placement:</span> Position electrodes near the treatment area, following motor points, trigger points, or dermatomes.</p></li></ul></p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Patient comfort and education:</bold> Ensure the patient understands the procedure, potential sensations (e.g., tingling, warmth), and expected outcomes. Adjust settings based on patient feedback to ensure comfort and effectiveness.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Evidence-based practice:</bold> Base decisions on the latest research and clinical guidelines to optimize treatment outcomes. Stay updated on advancements in electrotherapy modalities and techniques. Monitoring and evaluation, during treatment: Monitor the patient for signs of discomfort, burns, or adverse reactions. Adjust parameters as needed based on patient feedback and tolerance. Post-treatment: Assess the immediate effects of the session on pain, function, or other targeted outcomes. Long-term evaluation: Evaluate progress over multiple sessions, modifying the treatment plan if necessary.</p></li>

</ul>
</div>
</div><div class="section" id="ch11lev1sec2"><h1 class="title">SUGGESTIONS FOR CLINICAL DECISION-MAKING</h1>
<p class="noindent">Consider the prior experience of similar patients, previous physiotherapy treatment experience of patient, irritability of the patient, underlying pathology, contraindications, medical condition of the patient, special request by the referring clinician, patient's comfort, treatment time, area to be treated, depth of penetration, equipment availability, reliability of the equipment, familiarity with the equipment, proved outcome, professional suggestions and patient's response.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch11lev2sec3"><h2 class="title">Evidence</h2>
<p class="noindent">Evidence-based electrotherapy practice is based on high quality clinical research. Clinical research means research on patients conducted in a clinical setting. So, one can search for evidences at databases such as PEDro (<a href="http://www.pedro.fhs.usyd.edu.au" class="weblink">www.pedro.fhs.usyd.edu.au</a>), PubMed (<a href="http://www.pubmed.gov" class="weblink">www.pubmed.gov</a>), MEDLINE, Cochrane, CINAHL, EMBASE, and PsycINFO, etc. Nowadays, evidence-based clinical guidelines are also available for specific conditions and may be interpreted as per the local requirements. Sometimes there is a lack of strong evidence for specific conditions, making decisions more challenging. Sometimes there is no evidence either in favor or against and in that case the traditional approach of experience-based practice instead of evidence-based practice or expert opinion may be considered.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch11lev2sec4"><h2 class="title">Physiotherapist's Previous Experience</h2>
<p class="noindent">Most physiotherapists decide about the electrotherapeutic modalities based on their experience with similar kinds of cases. If their previous patient had responded to a modality then, they prefer the same one for their next patient, with similar clinical problem.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch11lev2sec5"><h2 class="title">Patient's Previous Experience</h2>
<p class="noindent">A patient's previous experience with modality can also be taken into consideration, while making a clinical decision about the modality that is to be selected. If your patient had beneficial effect with a particular modality then, use that modality. On the other hand, if your patient had an adverse effect or no response with that modality then, try to avoid the use of same modality.<a name="page272"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">272</span></span></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch11lev2sec6"><h2 class="title">Irritability</h2>
<p class="noindent">If the condition is highly irritable, then electroanalgesic modalities such as transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), interferential, etc., and cold therapy can be preferred. Patient-specific variability as there are individual differences in pain perception, skin sensitivity, and condition severity and require tailored approaches.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch11lev2sec7"><h2 class="title">Underlying Pathology</h2>
<p class="noindent">If underlying pathology is very acute then, cryotherapy and electroanalgesic modalities can be preferred. In subacute, superficial heating modalities and in chronic cases, deep heating modalities can be preferred. One should note the local temperature. It is suggested to choose cold if the area to be treated is hot (increased local temperature) because of underlying pathology and if the local temperature is not increased then choose hot.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch11lev2sec8"><h2 class="title">Contraindications</h2>
<p class="noindent">Rule out the possibility of contraindications for the modality you have decided to use. If it is contraindicated then, think of any other modality that is not contraindicated for that patient. For instance, you decided to use short-wave diathermy, but if you come to know that your patient has got a metal implant in the area of treatment then, you can choose a modality like infrared or hot pack rather than short-wave diathermy.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch11lev2sec9"><h2 class="title">Medical Condition of the Patient</h2>
<p class="noindent">Clinical decision-making should also be done on the basis of the underlying medical/surgical condition of the patient. For instance, if the patient is referred to you for pain management, but the underlying cause of the pain is tumor then, many of the electrotherapeutic modalities are contraindicated. In this case, you may think about the local application of TENS, rather than those modalities that are contraindicated.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch11lev2sec10"><h2 class="title">Special Request</h2>
<p class="noindent">Sometimes, the clinical decision-making about the use of electrotherapy modality is done on the basis of special request by the referring clinician.<a name="page273"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">273</span></span></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch11lev2sec11"><h2 class="title">Comfort of the Patient</h2>
<p class="noindent">If a patient feels comfortable with a modality, then, try to use the same. Few patients do not like current treatment and fear the same. Try to choose any other modality that will not cause electrical stimulation of sensory nerves and thereby discomfort to your patient.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch11lev2sec12"><h2 class="title">Treatment Time</h2>
<p class="noindent">If you have very little treatment time available for the treatment of your patient, as in the case of acute sports injuries. Then, choose an electrotherapy modality which requires less treatment time. For instance, vapocoolant spray and laser can be preferred in sports injuries.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch11lev2sec13"><h2 class="title">Area to be Treated</h2>
<p class="noindent">If the area to be treated is very small, then focal treatment such as therapeutic ultrasound can be preferred. If it is larger then, another modality like short-wave diathermy can be used.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch11lev2sec14"><h2 class="title">Depth of Penetration</h2>
<p class="noindent">Modality selection can be done on the basis of depth of penetration. For instance, if you have a patient with periostitis then, choose therapeutic ultrasound which has the highest depth of penetration of all the modalities.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch11lev2sec15"><h2 class="title">Equipment Availability</h2>
<p class="noindent">Clinical decision-making can also be done on the basis of equipment availability. For instance, you wanted to use long-wave diathermy but, if it is not available in your clinic or hospital then, you should think of any other modality that can have a similar effect. Thus, limited availability or functionality of devices may constrain options in clinical decision-making and alter your choice of decision-making.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch11lev2sec16"><h2 class="title">Reliability of Equipment</h2>
<p class="noindent">You should choose that equipment which gives you reliable performance.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch11lev2sec17"><h2 class="title">Familiarity</h2>
<p class="noindent">You should not use equipment unless you get familiarized with its controls and parameter settings.<a name="page274"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">274</span></span></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch11lev2sec18"><h2 class="title">Proved Outcome</h2>
<p class="noindent">If the treatment outcome is well proven and clinically established then, you should try to prefer that modality. For example, therapeutic ultrasound is proven to be better in the treatment of calcific bursitis and plantar fasciitis, etc., then try to use the same in these conditions.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch11lev2sec19"><h2 class="title">Professional Suggestions</h2>
<p class="noindent">Always follow professional suggestions and guidelines for the use of therapeutic modalities while treating various clinical conditions.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch11lev2sec20"><h2 class="title">Patient's Response</h2>
<p class="noindent">If your patient responds positively to the modality you have chosen, then continue the use of it, otherwise, think whether you should alter the dosimetry or prefer another modality. Further, patient compliance is also important and ensuring patient understanding and cooperation can impact compliance, clinical decision-making as well as treatment success.</p>
<div class="sidebar"><h2 class="title">Summary</h2>
<p class="">The physiotherapist's previous experience of similar patients, previous experience of the patient's physiotherapy treatment, irritability of the patient, underlying pathology, contraindications, medical condition of the patient, special request by the referring clinician, patient's comfort, treatment time, area to be treated, depth of penetration, equipment availability, reliability of the equipment, familiarity with equipment, proven outcome, professional suggestions and patient's response can be taken into consideration while making clinical decisions.</p>
