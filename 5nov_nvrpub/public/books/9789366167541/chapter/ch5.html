</div><div class="section" id="ch5lev1sec1"><h1 class="title">ELECTRODIAGNOSIS</h1>
<p class="noindent">In addition to therapy, electrical currents can be used for diagnostic purposes. <span class="italic">Electrodiagnosis means the detection of the electrical reactions of muscles and nerves for diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy, using electrotherapeutic currents or electromyography.</span> We can use currents like, interrupted direct current and perform various electrodiagnostic tests, such as rheobase, chronaxie, strength-duration curve, pulse ratio, galvanic-tetanic ratio, nerve conduction test, nerve distribution test, faradic-galvanic test, myotonic reaction, the reaction of degeneration, etc. When there is disease or injury of motor nerves or muscles, alterations are likely to occur in their response to electrical stimulation. The altered reactions to electrical stimulation may be of considerable assistance in the diagnosis of the lesion.</p>
<p class="indent">Electrodiagnosis helps to differentiate between nerve and muscle disorders (e.g., <span class="italic">neuropathy vs. myopathy</span>), evaluate the degree of nerve damage or muscle weakness, assess the response of nerves and muscles to electrical stimulation, predict the likelihood and timeline of recovery and thereby in prognosis, helps to plan for the treatment in terms of the type of current, intensity, duration, and type of electrotherapy to be used for therapeutic purposes. Electrophysiological studies and electrodiagnostic tests are indicated in case of suspected nerve injuries (e.g., peripheral neuropathy, radiculopathy), muscle weakness or atrophy, suspected myopathies or neuromuscular disorders, postsurgical assessments (e.g., after nerve repair or tendon transfer) and unexplained pain or sensory deficits.<a name="page126"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">126</span></span> The <span class="italic">advantages</span> of electrodiagnostic studies are that these tests provide objective data on neuromuscular function, are noninvasive and safe when performed correctly, are useful for tailoring rehabilitation protocols, and assist in prognosis and monitoring recovery. <span class="italic">Limitations</span> are that it requires specialized equipment and trained personnel, may not provide definitive diagnoses without correlating with other clinical findings and patient discomfort can occur during testing.</p>
</div><div class="section" id="ch5lev1sec2"><h1 class="title">RHEOBASE AND CHRONAXIE</h1>
<div class="section" id="ch5lev2sec1"><h2 class="title">Rheobase</h2>
<p class="noindent">Rheobase is a fundamental concept in electrophysiology, specifically in the study of excitable tissues like nerves and muscles. <span class="italic">Rheobase is the smallest amount of current required to produce a muscle contraction with a stimulus of infinite duration</span>. Usually, impulse of 100 ms duration is used to find out the rheobase for practical purposes. Denervation of muscles reduces rheobase and hence it may be less than that of innervated muscles. However, it may increase if reinnervation commences. Rheobase is also a part of the strength-duration curve, which describes the relationship between the intensity and duration of a stimulus needed to excite a nerve or muscle. Clinically, it is used in electrodiagnosis to assess the excitability of nerve and muscle tissues, it helps in nerve injury assessment by determining changes in excitability thresholds, and it is important in neuromodulation therapies and functional electrical stimulation (FES).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch5lev2sec2"><h2 class="title">Chronaxie</h2>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Chronaxie is the shortest duration of electrical impulse that will produce a response with current, double that of rheobase</span>. The chronaxie of the denervated muscles is higher than innervated muscles. The innervated muscle's chronaxie is 1 m/s, if constant voltage stimulator is used. Chronaxie is not a satisfactory method in case of partial denervation. In such case, chronaxie will be of predominant fibers that are innervated or denervated. Say, in case of 75% denervation, chronaxie will be same as that of completely denervated muscle.<a name="page127"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">127</span></span></p>
<p class="indent">(Here is a memory jogger to avoid confusion between rheobase and chronaxie. Remember that after alphabet C, alphabet D comes; so chronaxie is duration. Once you remember that chronaxie is duration, then it is easy to remember that rheobase is current).</p>
<p class="indent">In electrodiagnosis, chronaxie is considered as a measure of excitability and it provides an index of the time-dependent sensitivity of a nerve or muscle fiber to electrical stimulation. It is also the part of strength-duration curve and is specifically defined when the stimulus intensity is set at twice the rheobase value. It is measured in units of time, typically milliseconds (ms). The relationship between stimulus strength (I) and duration (T) is described by:</p>
<p class="aligncenter">I = Ir (1 + C/T)</p>
<p class="noindent">where I is stimulus strength, Ir is rheobase (minimum stimulus strength), T is the duration of the stimulus and C is chronaxie.</p>
<p class="indent">Chronaxie provides insight into the functional state of nerves and muscles, prolonged chronaxie suggests reduced excitability, which can occur in conditions like nerve damage or muscle denervation, in functional electrical stimulation (FES), the chronaxie value helps determine the optimal stimulus parameters, it ensures effective and safe stimulation during neuromuscular rehabilitation and chronaxie values differ between normal, injured, and diseased tissues, aiding diagnosis and treatment planning.</p>
</div>
</div><div class="section" id="ch5lev1sec3"><h1 class="title">STRENGTH-DURATION CURVES</h1>
<div class="section" id="ch5lev2sec3"><h2 class="title">Definition</h2>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Strength-duration curve is an electrodiagnostic procedure characterized by plotting a graph of, the amount of intensity required against various durations of impulse to determine the status of innervations of muscles. It is also called an intensity-time curve.</span></p>
<p class="indent">The strength-duration curve in electrodiagnosis was first described by L Lapicque in 1909. Lapicque, a French physiologist, conducted foundational work in electrophysiology and proposed the concepts of rheobase and chronaxie, which are integral to understanding the strength-duration relationship. His studies laid the groundwork for the modern interpretation of nerve and muscle excitability, helping to establish methods for evaluating the functional state of excitable tissues. These concepts are now widely used in clinical diagnostics and therapeutic applications involving electrical stimulation.<a name="page128"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">128</span></span></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch5lev2sec4"><h2 class="title">Apparatus and Other Requirements</h2>
<p class="noindent">A diagnostic muscle stimulator is used for plotting the strength-duration curve. One can also use sophisticated devices like Guidance-E that allows you to perform the SD curve and immediately shows the graph on the display screen. For this purpose, the apparatus should provide different durations of interrupted direct current. For example, 0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 10, 30, 50, 100 and 300 milliseconds with rectangular waveform. Stimulator with either constant voltage or constant current can be used for this purpose. In addition to this, electrodes, leads, Velcro straps, cotton swabs, water or normal saline, graph paper, pencil, and eraser are required for strength-duration curve plotting.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch5lev2sec5"><h2 class="title">Procedure</h2>
<p class="noindent">Procedure for plotting the strength-duration curve can be described in a stepwise manner.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch5lev3sec1"><h3 class="title">Preparation of Patient</h3>
<p class="noindent">Explain the procedure in brief to the patient. Position the patient in a comfortable position, which allows you an easy access to the body part where you would like to perform the strength-duration curve assessment. Request your patient to expose the area to be examined and ensure adequate draping. Make sure that there is adequate light to see the visible contractions of muscle without straining your eyes.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch5lev3sec2"><h3 class="title">Application of Electrodes</h3>
<p class="noindent">Secure the indifferent electrode at a convenient area, usually over midline of the body or origin of muscle and active electrode over motor point.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch5lev3sec3"><h3 class="title">Application of Current and Recording</h3>
<p class="noindent">Switch on the stimulator then select the longest impulse, say 300 m/s and increase the intensity so as to get minimal contraction. This minimal contraction may be assessed visually or by palpation of the tendon. Note, the intensity of current required to produce minimal contraction and then decrease the intensity to zero. Shorten the impulse, say now 100 m/s, again increase the intensity and note the current at which minimum accessible contraction is produced. Repeat this procedure by shortening the impulse duration say 30,10, 3, 1 and so on.<a name="page129"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">129</span></span></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch5lev3sec4"><h3 class="title">Drawing the Curve</h3>
<p class="noindent">After noting the current for various durations, a graph is plotted with strength of current on Y-axis and impulses or pulse durations on X-axis.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch5lev2sec6"><h2 class="title">Characteristics</h2>
<p class="noindent">It is the shape of curve, which is an important feature in determining the status of muscle innervations. So, when all the nerve fibers supplying the muscles are intact, then strength-duration curve is typical.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch5lev3sec5"><h3 class="title">Normal Innervation</h3>
<p class="noindent">Strength-duration curve with normal status of innervation of muscle will have various characteristics such as—initial portion of the graph is a straight line, which is parallel to the X-axis <bold>(<a href="#ch5fig1" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 5.1</a>)</bold>, there is no kink, the graph is complete and in other words, it is plotted from highest duration such as 300 milliseconds to 0.01. Rise in graph line occurs around 1 millisecond duration. The graph looks smooth. The curve of this typical shape is there because equal strength of current is required to get minimum assessable response with longer durations, while shorter pulses need a slight increase in the strength of stimulus each time when duration is shortened. The point at which this curve begins to rise is variable, but usually it is 1 millisecond with constant current.</p>
<div class="figure" id="ch5fig1" data-label="Fig. 5.1"><div class="title"><span class="item-label">Fig. 5.1</span> Normal curve.</div><img alt="Fig. 5.1" src="/MediumImage/129-1.jpg"><div class="additional-markup"></div></div>
<p class=""><a name="page130"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">130</span></span></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch5lev3sec6"><h3 class="title">Complete Denervation</h3>
<p class="noindent">The shape obtained on plotting the strength-duration curve of a muscle that is, completely denervated is typical in appearance <bold>(<a href="#ch5fig2" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 5.2</a>)</bold>. Initial part of the curve is not parallel. The plotted graph line looks somewhat vertical, starting from the X-axis. There is no kink in the curve. The graph line is incomplete because denervated muscle does not respond to smaller durations like 1, 0.3, 0.1, and so on. This typical appearance is due to the required increase in the strength of stimulus for all the impulses with a duration of &lt;100 milliseconds. Response may not be obtained to very small durations and hence the curve rises steeply and is further to the right than that of a normally innervated muscle. In denervated strength duration curve, the curve shifts upward and to the right, indicating increased thresholds for both strength and duration this reflects the reduced excitability of the denervated muscle fibers, which now rely on direct stimulation rather than neural input. The minimum stimulus strength (rheobase) is higher than normal because denervated muscles require stronger stimuli to contract. Chronaxie values are significantly prolonged, often exceeding 10 milliseconds, as denervated muscle fibers respond better to longer-duration stimuli and this is in contrast to innervated tissues, where chronaxie is typically under 1 millisecond. Further during strength duration curve testing, denervated muscle fibers exhibit slower contractile responses, as they are directly depolarized, bypassing the faster nerve-mediated excitation process.</p>

<p class=""><a name="page131"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">131</span></span></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch5lev3sec7"><h3 class="title">Partial Denervation</h3>
<p class="noindent">The graph of a muscle that is partially innervated is typical in appearance. The plotted graph line shows kink. The kink appears because the graph shows the features of innervated as well as denervated muscle <bold>(<a href="#ch5fig3" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 5.3</a>)</bold>. It happens due to the response of the muscle to various impulses. Impulses with higher pulse durations stimulate denervated as well as innervated muscle fibers. But the response to the smaller pulse durations is obtained by stimulating only innervated muscle fibers and hence to get minimal palpable or visible contractions from these innervated muscle fibers more intensity is required. Appearance of kink may give an approximate idea about the extent or proportion of innervation and denervation. If a large number of fibers are denervated then a greater part of the curve resembles that of denervated muscles and <span class="italic">vice versa</span>.</p>
<p class="indent">If the kink is located exactly at the center, then one may conclude that innervation and denervation may be 50%. But if three-fourth of the graph appears like innervated and one-fourth appears like denervated then innervation could be 75%, and denervation could be 25%. Appearance of kink can have two interpretations. If initially, muscle showed strength-duration curve of complete denervation and later there is the appearance of kink, that means that muscle is getting reinnervated. On the other hand, a muscle initially showed normal strength-duration curve and now kink appears, that means this muscle is getting denervated. In progressive innervation or denervation, the graph will move from the kink towards left side or right side, respectively.</p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="ch5lev2sec7"><h2 class="title">Variations</h2>
<p class="noindent">Strength-duration curve can be used to find out the status of sensory as well as motor nerve fibers <bold>(<a href="#ch5fig4" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 5.4</a>)</bold>. A digital strength-duration curve as seen on machine screen is represented in <bold><a href="#ch5fig5" class="ulink-inter">Figure 5.5</a>.</bold> If we take into consideration only sensory threshold or current perception threshold (just perception of current), then it can be helpful in evaluating the status of A-beta fibers. If we take motor-level intensity, then the motor nerve fibers or A-alpha can be evaluated. If we take suprasensory painful threshold, then it can tell us the status of C-fibers and A-delta type of fibers.</p>
<div class="figure" id="ch5fig4" data-label="Fig. 5.4"><div class="title"><span class="item-label">Fig. 5.4</span> Strength-duration curve of sensory, motor and pain fibers.</div><img alt="Fig. 5.4" src="/MediumImage/132-1.jpg"><div class="additional-markup"></div></div>
<div class="figure" id="ch5fig5" data-label="Fig. 5.5"><div class="title"><span class="item-label">Fig. 5.5</span> Digital strength-duration curve on machine screen.</div><img alt="Fig. 5.5" src="/MediumImage/132-2.jpg"><div class="additional-markup"></div></div>
<p class="noindent"><a name="page133"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">133</span></span>But hardly these variations are used clinically since there are sophisticated methods such as motor and sensory nerve conduction velocity tests which can be performed with electromyography. However, most commonly strength-duration curve is used to find out motor nerve fiber innervations of muscle.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch5lev2sec8"><h2 class="title">Advantages</h2>
<p class="noindent">The strength-duration curve is simple, reliable and cheaper. It indicates proportion of denervation. It may be less time consuming as compared to electromyography. It can be used as hand-side method. Further, it helps differentiate between normal, partially denervated, and completely denervated tissues, identifies the extent and severity of nerve or muscle damage, provides quantifiable data (rheobase and chronaxie) to evaluate tissue excitability, making it useful for monitoring progression or recovery. Guides in therapy and helps in the selection of appropriate electrical stimulation parameters for rehabilitation, such as pulse duration and intensity. The procedure is safe and noninvasive, making it suitable for repeated use during follow-up assessments. It can be customized and can be tailored to study specific muscle groups or nerves, providing targeted insights. The test is versatile and applicable in various clinical conditions, such as peripheral neuropathies, muscle denervation, and neurodegenerative diseases.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch5lev2sec9"><h2 class="title">Disadvantages</h2>
<p class="noindent">In large muscles only a proportion of fibers may respond, hence picture is not clearly shown. It is a qualitative rather than quantitative method of testing innervation. It will not point out the site of lesion. However, the site of lesion may be determined by nerve conduction test. Strength duration curve testing requires multiple measurements at different stimulus durations to construct the curve, which can be tedious, it requires expertise for accurate interpretation of the curve and demands specialized knowledge and training in electrophysiology. It has limited sensitivity and may not detect subtle changes in excitability or partial denervation early in the disease process. Equipment dependence since it relies on specific electromyography (EMG) or electrical stimulator devices, which may not be readily available in all clinical settings. Patients may experience discomfort since electrical stimulation can be uncomfortable, especially for prolonged or high-intensity pulses, environmental and biological factors may affect the results and results may be influenced by factors like skin resistance, electrode placement, temperature, hydration, and patient cooperation, potentially affecting reliability. The strength-duration curve has limited uses for CNS disorder and it primarily evaluates peripheral nerves and muscles; it is less useful for central nervous system pathologies.<a name="page134"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">134</span></span></p>
<p class="indent">There are certain other electrodiagnostic tests which are being widely used for various diagnostic purposes. Description of these tests and their uses are as follows:</p>
</div>
</div><div class="section" id="ch5lev1sec4"><h1 class="title">PULSE RATIO</h1>
<p class="noindent">The pulse ratio concept was first described by L Lapicque in 1909. Lapicque, a French physiologist, is best known for his work on nerve excitability and the development of key electrophysiological concepts, including rheobase and chronaxie. Pulse ratio is the ratio of current needed to produce a muscle contraction with an impulse of 1 millisecond to that of 100 milliseconds. In case of innervated muscle, very small or no increase in current is required when impulse is reduced from 100 m/s to 1 m/s. So, the ratio is small and it is around one, but it may vary up to 2.2 for innervated muscles (1:2.2). In the case of denervated muscles, the amount of current required to produce a contraction is more, and consequently the ratio is more than 2.5. The advantage of pulse ratio is, it can be performed swiftly, it is simple and quick to measure, noninvasive, easily reproducible and provides valuable insights into the functional state of excitable tissues. But the disadvantage is that the picture of innervation is not clear if a muscle is partially innervated, it is less detailed than the strength-duration curve, it may not capture subtle changes in excitability and it requires proper technique and equipment to ensure accuracy.</p>
</div><div class="section" id="ch5lev1sec5"><h1 class="title">FARADIC INTERRUPTED DIRECT CURRENT (IDC) TEST</h1>
<p class="noindent">The faradic IDC test is also vaguely termed as faradic-galvanic test rather than calling it as faradic interrupted direct current test (since the galvanic current term indicates direct current and not modified direct or interrupted direct current). The faradic and interrupted direct current (IDC) test was first described by Dr Guillaume-Benjamin Duchenne in the mid-19th century. Duchenne, a French neurologist and physiologist, is widely regarded as one of the pioneers in the field of electrodiagnosis and electrotherapy. It was widely used in the past to rule out whether a muscle is innervated or denervated.<a name="page135"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">135</span></span> Pertaining to characteristics of faradic current (pulse duration 0.1 to 1 m/s and frequency 50 to 100 Hz), it will stimulate only innervated muscles and not denervated muscles. Interrupted direct current with pulse duration such as 100 m/s will stimulate both innervated and denervated muscles. If a muscle responds to interrupted direct current with 100 m/s duration or higher duration but not to faradic current, then it may be a denervated muscle. <span class="italic">Advantages</span> of the faradic IDC test include that it helps in diagnosing the degree of denervation, it is useful for tracking recovery or degeneration over time, it provides insights for rehabilitation and electrical stimulation protocols. <span class="italic">Disadvantages</span> are that discomfort during stimulation, especially with IDC, requires specialized equipment and training and may not detect early or subtle changes in nerve or muscle function.</p>
</div><div class="section" id="ch5lev1sec6"><h1 class="title">NERVE CONDUCTIVITY TEST</h1>
<p class="noindent">It is preferable to call it nerve transmission test to avoid the possibility of confusion between nerve conductivity, nerve distribution and nerve conduction velocity (NCV) tests. Normally, a stimulus to a nerve trunk can produce the contraction of muscles supplied by it. But if the nerve fibers are degenerating, then, conductivity distal to the lesion is lost. For nerve conductivity test interrupted direct current with pulse duration of 0.1 or 0.3 millisecond is used. After applying this stimulus to a superficial nerve trunk, contractions of muscles supplied below this point is noted. If it produces the contractions, then it suggests that at least few or all the nerve fibers are intact and functioning. If this test is performed along the course of a nerve, then it may give us a clue about the possible site of the lesion.</p>
</div><div class="section" id="ch5lev1sec7"><h1 class="title">NERVE DISTRIBUTION TEST</h1>
<p class="noindent">Stimulating the nerve trunk and observing the resultant muscle contractions can determine the distribution of nerve and thereby it is easy to find out if there is any individual variation in it. This can help us to find out if there is any variation in the distribution of the nerve. Nerve distribution test helps determine the integrity of sensory and motor functions in specific nerve areas, aids in identifying localized nerve damage or compression along specific nerve pathways (e.g., in cases of carpal tunnel syndrome, sciatica, or cervical radiculopathy), assists in determining whether symptoms are due to nerve root, peripheral nerve, or plexus involvement, used in conjunction with other tests (such as EMG or NCV) to establish a complete diagnosis. Historically the nerve distribution test or dermatome mapping was first described by Sir Henry Head, a British neurologist, in the early 20th century.<a name="page136"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">136</span></span> He is best known for his work on the somatic sensory system, and his research laid the foundation for understanding how sensory nerves are distributed in the body. The <span class="italic">advantages</span> of the nerve distribution tests are that it is noninvasive and simple to perform, it helps localize nerve lesions and guide further diagnostic testing, it can be performed alongside other clinical assessments to refine the diagnosis. <span class="italic">Limitations</span> include that it requires experience to interpret findings accurately, it can be difficult in patients with widespread symptoms or those with multiple nerve involvement and in some sensory deficits may not be detectable with basic clinical testing.</p>
</div><div class="section" id="ch5lev1sec8"><h1 class="title">NEUROTIZATION TIME</h1>
<p class="noindent">The concept of neurotization time was first described by SD Alexander in the early 20th century. SD Alexander, a neurologist, studied the process of nerve regeneration and the time it takes for a regenerating nerve to reconnect and restore function after injury or surgical repair. <span class="italic">Neurotization time is a useful index that represents the ratio of the duration</span> <span class="italic">of neuropathy to the theoretical time necessary for reinnervation to take place</span>. In order to calculate the neurotization time, measure the distance from the probable site of the lesion up to the distal most muscle supplied by the affected nerve, in millimeter. Since the regeneration of nerve can occur at a rate of approximately 1 millimeter per day, calculate the anticipated number of days accordingly (remember that rate of nerve growth can vary from 1–5 mm per day). For instance, if the distance of lesion is 105 mm, then anticipated time is 105 days. Now find out the elapsed time in days from the patient. Calculate the neurotization time by the following formula:</p>
<div class="informalfigure"><img alt="" src="/MediumImage/136-1.jpg"></div>
<p class="indent">Less than 100% neurotization time indicates that a minimal time is elapsed for reinnervation. When neurotization time is 250% or more and it is accompanied with no electrodiagnostic evidence of regeneration, then the prognosis is poor and surgical intervention may be considered.</p>
<p class="indent">After a nerve injury, the proximal segment of the nerve (the part closer to the spinal cord) regenerates and begins to grow toward the distal segment (the part further from the body). Axonal growth occurs at an approximate rate of 1 millimeter per day in peripheral nerves, though this can vary depending on several factors.<a name="page137"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">137</span></span> Neurotization is the process in which regenerating nerve fibers reconnect with the appropriate target tissues (muscles or sensory areas). The neurotization time helps determine the outcome of nerve repair and guides rehabilitation strategies. The faster the nerve fibers reach the target tissues; the quicker recovery of function can occur. Delayed neurotization can lead to muscle atrophy, sensory loss, and functional impairment.</p>
<p class="indent"><bold>Factors affecting neurotization time</bold> include distance, age, type of injury, nerve type, surgical repair, etc.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Distance:</bold> The greater the distance between the injury site and the target tissue, the longer the neurotization time. This is especially important in nerve grafting, where the nerve segments need to grow across the graft site.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Age:</bold> Younger individuals typically experience faster nerve regeneration compared to older patients.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Type of injury:</bold> Complete nerve severance typically takes longer to regenerate compared to less severe injuries, such as neuropraxia.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Nerve type:</bold> Different nerves have different capacities for regeneration. Motor nerves (responsible for muscle movement) typically regenerate at a faster rate than sensory nerves.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Surgical repair:</bold> The quality of nerve repair (e.g., microsurgical techniques) can significantly impact the success and speed of neurotization.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">For motor function, it may take several months to a year for significant recovery, depending on the distance between the injury site and the muscle. For sensory function, recovery may take longer and is often less complete than motor recovery. Full recovery after nerve injury and neurotization can be a slow process, with some residual deficits possible depending on the extent of nerve damage.</p>
</div><div class="section" id="ch5lev1sec9"><h1 class="title">GALVANIC-TETANUS RATIO</h1>
<p class="noindent">The concept of the Galvanic Tetanic Ratio was first described by Sherrington in the early 20th century. CS Sherrington, a British neuroscientist, made significant contributions to the understanding of neurology and muscle physiology. He is best known for his work on reflexes, motor control, and neurophysiology. <span class="italic">Galvanic-tetanus ratio (GTR) is also called tetanic frequency ratio or the tetanus-twitch ratio</span>. Normally frequency of 20 to 50 cycles per second is required to get tetanic response with pulse duration equal to chronaxie. But in case of denervated muscle, it gets reduced to 5 to 10 cycles per second.<a name="page138"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">138</span></span> This happens because of loss of accommodation to long-durated impulses and a slow type of contraction in denervated muscle. Galvanic-tetanus ratio requires the use of a stimulator with variable impulse frequency output of 1 to 50 per second and calibrated duration of impulses. For testing denervated muscle, this duration must correspond to the chronaxie. It is convenient, to stimulate the muscle with a single active electrode and with a current intensity sufficient to cause minimal contraction. Gradually vary the frequency, starting at a lower range like one per second until tetanus is produced. <span class="italic">Advantages</span> of GTR: It provides objective data about the state of the nerve-muscle unit, is noninvasive and easy to perform in clinical settings, and is useful in tracking progression or recovery after nerve injury. <span class="italic">Limitations</span> of GTR: Subjective variations since muscle contraction strength can vary due to patient factors, such as discomfort or fatigue. Results depend on the technique and accurate results require skilled application of both galvanic and faradic stimulation and GTR is not standalone; it must be used alongside other diagnostic tools like nerve conduction studies and electromyography (EMG).</p>
</div><div class="section" id="ch5lev1sec10"><h1 class="title">DERMO OHMOMETRY</h1>
<p class="noindent">The concept of dermo-ohmometry, the measurement of skin resistance or electrical conductance was first described by Charles Féré, a French neurologist and physiologist, in the late 19th century. Féré conducted pioneering studies on the electrical properties of the skin and their relationship to physiological and psychological states. The term is derived from “dermo” (relating to the skin) and “ohm” (the unit of electrical resistance). <span class="italic">The study of human skin resistance is known as dermo-ohmometry</span>. It may also be called <span class="italic">neurodermometry</span> or <span class="italic">galvanic skin response</span>. It is primarily used to assess the physiological and neurological state of the skin and its underlying systems. It can be studied with GSR device that is at present rarely used for this purpose. It is nowadays used for relaxation purpose by incorporating it with biofeedback kind of devices. Normal skin resistance may vary from 10,000 to 20 million ohms, depending on the distribution of the sweat glands. In complete lesion of a mixed nerve, there is anhidrosis due to reduced activity of the sweat glands. As a result of anhidrosis, there is increase in the skin resistance due to reduced sweat that permits easy passage of the current. The skin has a specific electrical resistance that can vary based on hydration levels or moisture in the skin, autonomic nervous system activity that is altered with stress, arousal, or other physiological states, pathological conditions like neuropathy, burns, or infections affect skin impedance.<a name="page139"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">139</span></span> Electrical resistance is measured by applying a weak electrical current to the skin and recording the opposition to the current's flow. It is used for electrodiagnosis, neurological assessment, burns and wound healing, psychophysiological research and dermatological evaluations. <span class="italic">Advantages</span> are, it is noninvasive, safe, painless, it is quick and easy and can be performed in outpatient settings, it is versatile and applicable in various fields, including neurology, dermatology, and psychophysiology. <span class="italic">Limitations</span> of dermo ohmometrey are variability in results since it be influenced by external factors like temperature, hydration, or electrode placement, subjective interpretation as it requires careful correlation with clinical findings, and it should be used as an adjunct tool along with other diagnostic tests for a comprehensive assessment. Modern application of this technique includes its use in the analysis of body composition through the bioimpedance analysis, skin conductance monitoring for stress and emotion research, it is portable diagnostic device that can be used for clinical and research purpose.</p>

<p class="noindent">It is also known as <bold>Erb's Polar formula</bold>. Erb's Polar formula is a concept in electrodiagnosis described by Wilhelm Heinrich Erb, a German neurologist, in the late 19th century. It provides a framework for understanding the effects of electrical stimulation, particularly in the evaluation of nerve and muscle excitability. Erb's work focused on identifying how different polarities of electrical stimulation (anodal or cathodal) and the timing of current application (closing or opening of the circuit) influence the excitability of nerves and muscles. The normal response obtained to cathode and anode is CCC &gt; ACC &gt; AOC &gt; COC.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Cathodal closing current (CCC):</bold> Most excitable, produces the strongest response.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Anodal closing current (ACC):</bold> Less excitable than CC, but can still elicit a response.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Anodal opening current (AOC):</bold> Weakly excitatory, often inhibitory.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Cathodal opening current (COC):</bold> Least excitatory, generally inhibitory.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">It means normally a better contraction is obtained with a cathodal closing current than an anodal closing current. Closing and opening terminologies are used because when this experiment must have been tried a simple key switch which is “on” by closing and “off” by opening must have been used. In denervation, reversal of this formula may be noted. In denervated muscle, it may be ACC &gt; CCC &gt; AOC &gt; COC.<a name="page140"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">140</span></span></p>
</div><div class="section" id="ch5lev1sec12"><h1 class="title">MYOTONIC REACTION</h1>
<p class="noindent">The myotonic electrical reaction was first described by Julius Friedrich Cohnheim, a German pathologist, in the 19th century. He observed and documented the characteristic delayed muscle relaxation and abnormal electrical responses in individuals with myotonia. In myotonic cases, typical response to the faradic stimulation occurs. The muscles remain in tetanic contraction for some time as long as 20 seconds even after the stimulus has ceased. This response can be obtained initially and later on, due to the exhaustion of the muscle, contraction response ceases altogether. But the same response once again can be obtained after a period of rest.</p>
<p class="indent">A <bold>key clinical feature</bold> of myotonia is difficulty in quickly releasing a grip or relaxing muscles after movement, delayed relaxation after a muscle contraction it takes longer than normal to relax, leading to stiffness and an abnormal electrical stimulation response during the electrodiagnosis like a single pulse or repetitive stimulation provoke prolonged muscle contractions. The delayed relaxation is due to abnormal ion channel function in the muscle membrane, particularly involving reduced chloride conductance (e.g., myotonia congenita) and persistent depolarization due to prolonged sodium influx (e.g., paramyotonia congenita). This ion imbalance causes sustained depolarization of the muscle membrane, leading to prolonged contraction. Myotonic reaction is positive in:</p>

</div><div class="section" id="ch5lev1sec13"><h1 class="title">REACTION OF DEGENERATION</h1>
<p class="noindent">The reaction of degeneration (RD) to electrical muscle stimulation was first described by Duchenne de Boulogne (Guillaume-Benjamin-Amand Duchenne), a 19th-century French neurologist and physiologist. <bold>Duchenne</bold> is often regarded as the ‘<bold>Father of modern electrophysiology and electrotherapy’</bold>. Reaction of degeneration may occur following peripheral nerve injuries. Reaction of degeneration is of three types, such as, complete reaction of degeneration (CRD), partial reaction of degeneration (PRD) and absolute reaction of degeneration (ARD).<a name="page141"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">141</span></span></p>
<div class="section" id="ch5lev2sec10"><h2 class="title">Complete Reaction</h2>
<p class="noindent">Complete reaction of degeneration is also known as full or total reaction of degeneration. In complete reaction of degeneration, nerve does not respond to either faradic or interrupted galvanic current. However, muscle may respond to long-durated pulse of interrupted galvanic current, muscle contraction is slow or sluggish, motor point may get shifted and polar formula may get reversed.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch5lev2sec11"><h2 class="title">Partial Reaction</h2>
<p class="noindent">In partial reaction of degeneration, there is decreased response by nerve to faradic and interrupted galvanic current. However, muscle may have decreased response to faradic but better response to interrupted galvanic current. The muscle contraction may be slow, but it is not pronounced as in CRD.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch5lev2sec12"><h2 class="title">Absolute Reaction</h2>
<p class="noindent">There is absence of response to any current in muscle as well as nerve. It represents the final stage of complete reaction of degeneration with unfavorable outcome. You should be sure of this before informing it to the patient.</p>
<p class="indent">Clinically, the reaction of degeneration helps identify nerve injuries, neuropathies, and the degree of nerve or muscle damage, it is particularly useful in distinguishing neurogenic from myogenic causes of muscle weakness. The presence and degree of RD provide information about the likelihood and timeline of nerve regeneration and guides for electrotherapy treatment interventions including the selection of the therapeutic currents.</p>

<div class="section" id="ch5lev2sec13"><h2 class="title">Definition</h2>
<p class="noindent">Although a lot of scientists have contributed to the EMG. Edward H Lambert is known as the Father of EMG. <span class="italic">Electromyography (EMG/ENMG) is the study of the electrical activity of muscle by means of surface electrodes placed over the skin, or needle electrodes inserted in the muscle</span> itself. By electromyography, we can study motor unit potential, motor nerve conduction velocity, sensory nerve conduction velocity, etc. Electromyography is also called <bold>electroneuromyography</bold> or <bold>ENMG</bold>. Electroneuromyography is a clinical electrophysiological evaluation, which consists of the observation, analysis and interpretation of the bioelectrical activity of muscle and nerve.<a name="page142"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">142</span></span></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch5lev2sec14"><h2 class="title">Uses</h2>
<p class="noindent">Electroneuromyography is used to diagnose the diseases of the muscle, such as myopathies, myasthenia gravis, etc. It can be used to differentiate between lesions of anterior horn cells, the nerve fibers and the muscles. Also, ENMG can be used to determine sensory and motor nerves conduction velocities. It can be of major help in determining site, severity and prognosis of peripheral nerve lesions. It can analyze the muscle work involved in a complex activity.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch5lev2sec15"><h2 class="title">Contraindications</h2>
<p class="noindent">Although electromyography with surface electrodes has very minimal contraindications, electromyography with needle electrodes is contraindicated in dermatitis, uncooperative patient, pacemaker, blood transmittable diseases, extreme swelling, abnormal blood clotting factor and patient on an anticoagulant therapy. Gloves and eye protection should be used in case the EMG is to be done in individuals with blood transmittable diseases.</p>

<div class="section" id="ch5lev3sec8"><h3 class="title">Electrodes</h3>
<p class="noindent">Electrode is a device or metal conductor, which introduces or picks up electricity from the tissues. In other words, electrode is a conductor that stimulates or records the electrical activity of tissues.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Stimulating electrode:</bold> In ENMG study, electrodes are required to stimulate or evoke action potential in excitable tissues of interest that is muscle or nerve. Stimulating electrode is a bipolar hand-held electrode that consists of anode and cathode, separated by two-to-three-centimeter distance. It is used to stimulate or activate peripheral nerves and/or muscles during electrophysiological assessment.<a name="page143"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">143</span></span></p></li>

<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Pickup electrodes:</bold> To monitor the responses of excitable tissue to voluntary or evoked potential, pickup electrodes are used. These pickup electrodes record the electrical activity from the tissues of interest.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">Pickup electrodes are active electrodes, reference electrodes and ground electrodes (<bold>Mnemonic: ‘RAG’</bold>, where R: reference, A: active and G: ground). <bold>Active electrode</bold> is an electrode which pick up the potential difference from the tissues. <bold>Reference electrode</bold> is an electrode that helps to pick up potential difference by acting as a reference terminal, which completes the circuit. <bold>Ground electrode</bold> is an electrode, which is also known as zero potential electrode or shield electrode or guard electrode. It is made up of metal and is usually larger than active and reference electrode. It is placed on the body surface at some distance over an area of little electrical activity such as bony prominences.</p>
<p class="indent"><bold>Active and reference electrodes are of two main types, namely surface and needle electrodes</bold>.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p class=""><bold>Surface electrodes:</bold> The surface electrodes are placed on the skin to pick up the electrical activity. These are generally made up of metals such as silver, gold, platinum. An efficient conduction through these electrodes can be obtained, if skin is prepared by cotton swab dipped in spirit and by placing an electroconductive gel in between the electrodes and the skin. A surface electrode varies from 0.5 cm to several centimeter in diameter. These electrodes must be held firmly in place with adhesive tape or straps in order to obtain constant recording of muscle electrical activity. These electrodes are used when the excitable tissues include a comparatively large area. Metal-disk electrode, dual electrode, spring electrode are the commonly used types of surface electrodes.<a name="page144"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">144</span></span></p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Needle electrodes:</bold> These are placed underneath the skin, either near or directly in the excitable tissues of interest. They are prepared from platinum, silver or stainless steel. Needle electrodes are used when activity of very few motor units or muscle fibers is to be studied. This can be done easily with these electrodes as they have a reasonably small exploring surface. The different types of needle electrodes are monopolar, concentric, bipolar, multi-electrode, etc.</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch5lev3sec9"><h3 class="title">Preamplifier</h3>
<p class="noindent">Preamplifier is a device, which increases the magnitude of potentials picked up by the electrode so that they can be carried to the amplifier without getting influenced by unwanted potentials. It is usually situated in a remote box connected to the main ENMG system by a cable on one side, and on other side to the pickup electrodes through leads. This arrangement allows the preamplifier to be placed close to the electrodes to which it is directly connected by reasonably short leads in order to minimize the interference.</p>
<p class="indent">Preamplifier reduces the noise as it amplifies the magnitude and the strength of pickup potentials. Noise is nothing but any interfering, unwanted sound. It may arise from internal or external sources and hence noise can be termed as internal noise or external noise. Internal noise originates within the system. External noise originates from external sources, such as, electric wiring in the building, relay transmitters, radiofrequency, etc. External noise is also known as interference or artifact. Preamplifier allows differential amplification by selecting amplification of original potentials while rejecting interfering potentials.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch5lev3sec10"><h3 class="title">Amplifier</h3>
<p class="noindent">Amplifier follows preamplifier. It is an electronic machine, which is used to increase the amplitude of electrical signal level fed by preamplifier. Amplifier is used to make small electrical signals larger on signal display instrument such as oscilloscopes, computer screen or strip-chart recorders. A characteristic feature of an amplifier is its gain. Gain is the relationship between input voltage amplitude of the signal and output voltage amplitude from the amplifier. If the peak voltage of a monophasic input signal is doubled from 2 millivolt to 4 millivolt, then the gain of the amplification is 2 and if the same output signal's peak amplitude is increased to 10 mV then the gain of amplification is five. Most amplifiers are constructed so that the users can adjust the amplifier gain to a suitable level. The amplifier control for such adjustment is often called as sensitivity. Frequency response or filter control in amplifier responds to low and high frequency limits adjusted with frequency response controls, in order to minimize noise.<a name="page145"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">145</span></span></p>
<p class="indent">Amplifier may be simple or differential. A simple amplifier is a device that enhances all voltage differences between recording electrodes. Differential amplifier is the amplifier, which increases the difference between the two signals. As biological potentials are generally of several orders and magnitude, lower amplitude than 60 Hz interferes, and the use of simple amplifier may not allow the examiner to adequately visualize the bioelectrical potentials of interest. To overcome this, a differential amplifier is used. The differential amplification technique rejects signals that are common to both electrodes and enhances signals that are different. This is called common-mode rejection. Differential amplifier uses a ground electrode to compare the signals of the two recording electrodes. Noise appears identical at both electrodes and will be rejected by common mode.</p>

<p class="noindent">EMG display or CRT display is used to visualize recorded action potentials in the form of amplitude versus time graph. It consists of following parts: Evacuated envelope, electron gun, horizontal deflection plates and vertical deflection plates.</p>

<div class="section" id="ch5lev3sec14"><h3 class="title">Total Duration</h3>
<p class="noindent">It is the duration between initial deviations from the baseline to the return to the baseline. Total duration depends on the amplification gain, filter and whether or not the units are averaged. It varies between 5 and 10 milliseconds.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Spike duration:</bold> It is the time from the onset of the initial negative spike to the last most positive directed spike. It is from 2 to 10 ms.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Amplitude:</bold> It is the maximum voltage measured from peak to peak. The density of muscle fibers, their diameters and how close together are their end plates or how synchronously they discharge, determines amplitude. Amplitude varies greatly in normal muscles. It may be 100 to 200 microvolts.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Phases:</bold> Motor units are usually biphasic or triphasic. <span class="italic">Biphasic</span>, when recorded at end plate. <span class="italic">Triphasic</span>, when recorded away from end plate zone. The total number of phases is determined by adding one to the number of baseline crosses. A motor unit potential (MUP) is considered <span class="italic">polyphasic</span> if it has greater than four phases. Frequently, the MUPs have a saw-tooth like pattern where there are many changes of directions or turns but not actual baseline crosses. These potentials are referred to as serrated MUPs and are the measurements of the synchronicity of the muscle fibers discharging.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">Parameters of normal unit potential are—amplitude: 100–2,000 μv, duration: 2–10 ms, waveform: Two to four phases, but usually triphasic, frequency: 1–60 per second (150 in eye muscles), sound: Clear sharp thump or plunk and rise time: 100–200 seconds.<a name="page147"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">147</span></span></p>

<div class="section" id="ch5lev2sec18"><h2 class="title">Polyphasic Potential</h2>
<p class="noindent">The EMG examination may reveal a more complex shape than normal motor unit potentials. These are supposed to be the electrical expressions of a degenerating or regenerating, but not denervated motor units. It arises from nonsynchronous firing of many muscle fibers comprising a motor unit. If this polyphasicity occurs in a muscle, which has previously demonstrated widespread fibrillation on potentials of denervation, such polyphasic potentials are often called nascent motor units. Parameters of polyphasic potentials are amplitude: 20 to 5,000 microvolts, duration: 2 to 25 ms, waveform: 5 to 25 phases, frequency: 2 to 30 per second and sound: Rough, rasping or rattling <bold>(<a href="#ch5fig8" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 5.8</a>)</bold>. One to 12% of normal EMG may show polyphasic potentials.</p>

<p class="noindent">Fibrillation potential <bold>(<a href="#ch5fig9" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 5.9</a>)</bold> occurs due to spontaneous repetitive contraction of a single muscle fiber. It is a fundamental sign of denervation. It appears in 15 to 20 days but does not appear immediately following nerve injury. It may occur as early as 5 days following nerve lesion. The fibrillation tracing always begins with a positive voltage. Parameters are, amplitude: 10 to 600 microvolts, duration: 1 to 2 milliseconds, waveform: Mono or diphasic spike (usually diphasic), sound: Sharp high-pitched click (like rain on the roof).</p>

<p class="indent">They occur irregularly at a rate varying from 1 to 50 per minute. They are of two types, simple and complex. Simple fasciculations are biphasic or triphasic and complex fasciculations are polyphasic. Polyphasic fasciculation potentials can be further divided into usual polyphasic fasciculation potential and iterative polyphasic potential, based on the number of isoelectric crosses.

<p class="noindent">These are MUPs with more than 200 microvolts and duration of 12 to 15 milliseconds. They are frequently seen in anterior horn cell diseases like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or poliomyelitis. It may be because of selective destruction of small motor units, so that only the large ones are intact. It may be because of sprouting of the intact motor neuron branches to its denervated neighbors, thus enlarging the scope of the neuron. Its stimulation firing will therefore give a giant potential <bold>(<a href="#ch5fig13" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 5.13</a>)</bold>.</p>

Blink reflex is used for identifying the pathologies affecting cranial nerves such as Bell's palsy, cerebellopontine angle tumors, Guillain-Barré syndrome and central demyelinating diseases.</p>
<p class="indent">The blink reflex was first described by Overend Watson and Marcus A Colebatch in the 20th century as an electrically elicited counterpart of the corneal reflex. The foundational studies explored the pathways involving the trigeminal (V) and facial (VII) nerves and their integration in the brainstem. The blink reflex was further developed and standardized in clinical neurophysiology over subsequent decades, with a focus on its diagnostic utility for assessing cranial nerve and brainstem integrity.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="italic">The blink reflex test is an electrophysiological test used to evaluate the integrity of the trigeminal and facial nerve pathways</span>. It mimics the corneal reflex but is elicited electrically rather than mechanically. This test provides valuable information about the functional status of the afferent and efferent components of the reflex arc, including the brainstem nuclei.</p>
<p class="indent">The <bold>purpose</bold> of the blink reflex test is to:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Assess cranial nerves:</bold> Evaluate the trigeminal nerve (CN V) as the sensory (afferent) pathway and the facial nerve (CN VII) as the motor (efferent) pathway.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Detect brainstem lesions:</bold> Identify lesions affecting the pons and medulla, where the reflex arc is integrated.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Diagnose neuropathies:</bold> Useful in peripheral neuropathies, multiple sclerosis, Bell's palsy, and other cranial nerve disorders.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">The blink reflex involves two responses recorded from the orbicularis oculi muscles:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>R1 response:</bold> Ipsilateral, short-latency response mediated by the trigeminal and facial nerves via a monosynaptic pathway in the brainstem and</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>R2 response:</bold> Bilateral, longer-latency response mediated by polysynaptic connections in the brainstem.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">The <bold>procedure for blink reflex testing</bold> involves various steps like preparation of the patient, electrode placement, stimulation, and recording (<bold>Mnemonic</bold>: <bold>‘PRES’</bold> where P: preparation, R: recording, E: electrodes and S: stimulation).<a name="page153"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">153</span></span></p>

<p class="noindent">These are voltage changes monitored from the tissues of cerebral cortex, brainstem and spinal cord, in response to various applied sensory stimuli. Thus, function of somatosensory cortex, visual cortex and auditory region of brainstem can be evaluated. They are of various types, such as:</p>

<div class="section" id="ch5lev3sec15"><h3 class="title">Somatosensory Evoked Potentials</h3>
<p class="noindent">The concept of somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs) was first described in the 1950s by pioneering neurophysiologists. Among them, George Dawson, a British neuroscientist, played a significant role in the development and recording of SSEPs. In 1951, Dawson demonstrated the cortical response to peripheral nerve stimulation using scalp electrodes, which later became known as the Dawson potential. His work laid the foundation for modern evoked potential techniques, including SSEPs, which evaluate sensory pathways through electrical stimulation and response recording. Subsequent refinements and clinical applications of SSEPs expanded in the following decades, becoming a cornerstone of neurophysiological diagnostics and monitoring.</p>
<p class="indent"><span class="italic">Somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs) are electrophysiological tests used to evaluate the functional integrity of sensory pathways from peripheral nerves to the cerebral cortex</span> <bold>(<a href="#ch5fig16" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 5.16</a>)</bold>. SSEPs are commonly used in the diagnosis and monitoring of neurological disorders and during intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring. SSEPs record electrical responses generated by the nervous system in response to the stimulation of a peripheral sensory nerve and these responses reflect the conduction of sensory signals through the peripheral nerves, spinal cord, brainstem, and cerebral cortex.</p>

<div class="section" id="ch5lev3sec16"><h3 class="title">Brainstem Auditory Evoked Potentials (BAEPs)</h3>
<p class="noindent">The <bold>brainstem auditory evoked potential (BAEP),</bold> also known as <bold>auditory brainstem response (ABR),</bold> was first described by Jewett and Williston in 1971. Dr Don Jewett and his colleague Dr Frederick Williston demonstrated the ability to record small, time-locked electrical signals generated in the auditory pathway using scalp electrodes after auditory stimulation. They characterized the distinct waveforms representing the sequential activation of neural structures in the auditory pathway, from the cochlear nerve to the brainstem. This discovery provided a noninvasive method to evaluate the integrity of the auditory system, particularly the brainstem, and has since become a critical diagnostic tool in audiology and neurology.</p>
<p class="indent">BAEP is used to evaluate the auditory nerve and auditory pathways in the brainstem. It is widely employed in audiology, neurology, and intraoperative monitoring. BAEP measures the electrical activity generated in the auditory system from the cochlea to the brainstem in response to auditory stimuli, typically clicks or tone bursts. The response is recorded as a series of waveforms, each corresponding to a specific structure in the auditory pathway.<a name="page158"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">158</span></span></p>
<p class="indent"><bold>Procedure</bold> of BAEP or ABR includes in various steps like:</p>

<div class="section" id="ch5lev3sec17"><h3 class="title">Visual Evoked Potentials</h3>
<p class="noindent">The <bold>visual evoked potential (VEP)</bold> was first described in the late 20th century, with significant contributions from George Dawson in the 1950s. Dawson is credited with pioneering studies on evoked potentials, including the development of techniques to record electrical responses from the brain following visual stimulation. Later, in 1964, Halliday, McDonald, and Mushin refined the recording and interpretation of VEPs, making it a practical diagnostic tool. Their work established the clinical utility of VEPs for evaluating the integrity of the visual pathways, including the optic nerve and occipital cortex. These early studies laid the groundwork for the widespread use of VEPs in diagnosing and monitoring visual and neurological disorders.</p>
<p class="indent">Visual evoked potential (VEP) is a noninvasive electrophysiological test used to assess the functional integrity of the visual pathways from the retina to the occipital cortex. It measures the electrical responses generated in the visual cortex in response to visual stimuli, such as patterns or flashes. VEP tests the conduction of visual signals through the optic nerve, optic chiasm, optic tracts, lateral geniculate body, optic radiations, and the primary visual cortex. The test is highly sensitive to detecting delays or abnormalities in the visual pathways caused by demyelination, compression, or ischemia.</p>
<p class="indent">The <bold>procedure</bold> for VEP includes various steps like:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Preparation:</bold> The patient sits comfortably in a dimly lit room and the eyes are focused on a visual stimulus displayed on a monitor or flash source.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Electrode placement:</bold> Active electrode is placed over the occipital scalp (e.g., Oz based on the international 10–20 system). The reference electrode is placed on the mid-frontal area (Fz), ground electrode is placed on the forehead or another neutral site.</p></li>

</ul>
<p class="indent">The <span class="italic">advantages</span> of VEP are that it is noninvasive and safe and suitable for all age groups, it is sensitive and detects subclinical visual pathway dysfunction, it is objective and independent of patient cooperation or subjective input.

<p class="indent"><bold>Interpretation</bold> of normal VEP shows P100 latency within normal range and symmetrical waveforms between the two eyes.

<div class="section" id="ch5lev3sec18"><h3 class="title">Repetitive Nerve Stimulation (RNS or Jolly Test)</h3>
<p class="noindent"><bold>Jolly's test</bold> is the historical term for what is now commonly referred to as the <bold>repetitive nerve stimulation (RNS) test</bold>, used to evaluate the integrity of neuromuscular transmission. It was first described by Friedrich Jolly, a German neurologist, in 1895 as a clinical method to detect neuromuscular dysfunctions, particularly myasthenia gravis.</p>
<p class="indent">The <bold>principle</bold> of Jolly's test/RNS test is that the neuromuscular transmission relies on the release of acetylcholine (ACh) at the motor end plate to elicit muscle contraction and disorders like myasthenia gravis (MG) and Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) alter this process, leading to measurable changes in the response of muscles to repetitive stimulation of the associated motor nerve. In the RNS test, a decremental response (progressive reduction in the amplitude of compound muscle action potentials or CMAPs) is typically seen in postsynaptic disorders like MG <bold>(<a href="#ch5fig19" class="ulink-inter">Figs. 5.19A and B</a>)</bold> and an incremental response (increased CMAP amplitude) is observed in presynaptic disorders like LEMS.<a name="page163"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">163</span></span></p>

<p class="indent">The <bold>procedure</bold> for the RNS includes various steps like:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Preparation:</bold> The patient is positioned comfortably and the skin over the recording and stimulating sites is cleaned to reduce impedance.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Electrode placement:</bold> The recording electrode is placed over the belly of the target muscle. The reference electrode is placed over a bony prominence near the muscle and the stimulating electrode is placed over the motor nerve innervating the muscle.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Stimulation:</bold> A series of electrical pulses is delivered to the nerve at low frequency (e.g., 2–5 Hz) for at least 5–10 stimuli and in some cases, high-frequency stimulation (10–50 Hz) or postexercise stimulation may be used.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Recording:</bold> The CMAPs generated in the muscle are recorded after each stimulus and changes in amplitude and waveform shape are analyzed. A normal response shows stable CMAP amplitudes or &lt;10% decrement over the train of stimuli. An abnormal response in the form of a decremental response with a progressive decrease in CMAP amplitude is seen in postsynaptic disorders, such as myasthenia gravis and an incremental response is seen in a progressive increase in CMAP amplitude with high-frequency stimulation or after exercise in presynaptic disorders, such as LEMS or botulism.<a name="page164"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">164</span></span></p></li>

<p class="noindent">H-reflex test is also known as H-wave or Hoffman response <bold>(<a href="#ch5fig20" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 5.20</a>)</bold>. It can be performed in upper and lower limb to get quantitative information about the stretch reflex pathway. In simpler words, it is an electrically elicited monosynaptic reflex.</p>
<p class="indent">The German physiologist Johann Hoffmann first described the H-reflex (Hoffmann's reflex or H-wave) in 1918. Hoffmann observed this electrically evoked reflex while studying spinal reflexes and their conduction pathways. The H-reflex is an electrically induced analogue of the stretch reflex (e.g., the Achilles reflex) and is used to assess the integrity of the sensory and motor pathways of the reflex arc, particularly the Ia afferent fibers and alpha motor neurons.</p>
<p class="indent">The H-reflex is a diagnostic tool in electromyography (EMG) and nerve conduction studies that evaluates the integrity of the reflex arc in the spinal cord. It is an electrically elicited response that mimics the monosynaptic stretch reflex and is primarily used to assess sensory and motor nerve conduction. The H-reflex (H-wave) is evoked by electrically stimulating a mixed peripheral nerve, such as the tibial nerve, and recording the response from the muscle innervated by that nerve, typically the soleus muscle.<a name="page165"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">165</span></span></p>
<div class="figure" id="ch5fig20" data-label="Fig. 5.20"><div class="title"><span class="item-label">Fig. 5.20</span> H-reflex.</div><img alt="Fig. 5.20" src="/MediumImage/165-1.jpg"><div class="additional-markup"></div></div>
<p class="noindent">The reflex represents the following pathway: Electrical stimulation activates Ia sensory afferent fibers in the nerve, the impulse travels to the spinal cord, where it synapses with alpha motor neurons and the motor response travels back to the muscle, resulting in a measurable electrical signal. The H-reflex is analogous to the stretch reflex, but it bypasses the muscle spindle since it is evoked electrically rather than mechanically.</p>
<p class="indent">The <bold>procedure</bold> for H-reflex testing includes various steps like:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Preparation:</bold> Ensure the patient is relaxed and positioned comfortably (e.g., prone or supine for lower limb testing), clean the skin, and place electrodes appropriately.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Electrode placement:</bold>
<ul style="list-style-type: square">
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Recording electrode (active):</span> Over the muscle belly (e.g., soleus for tibial nerve testing).</p></li>

<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Ground electrode:</span> Positioned between the stimulation and recording electrodes.</p></li></ul></p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Stimulation:</bold> Deliver a submaximal electrical stimulus to the nerve (e.g., the tibial nerve at the popliteal fossa) and gradually increase the intensity until both the H-reflex and M-wave (direct motor response) are observed.<a name="page166"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">166</span></span></p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Recording:</bold> Measure the latency, amplitude, and persistence of the H-reflex and compare these parameters to the patient's contralateral limb or normative data.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent"><bold>Parameters analyzed</bold> in H-reflex testing are:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Latency:</bold> Time from stimulus delivery to the onset of the H-reflex and it reflects conduction along the reflex arc, including the Ia afferent fibers and alpha motor neurons.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Amplitude:</bold> Reflects the number of motor units activated and a reduction may indicate nerve damage or conduction block.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Persistence:</bold> The consistency of the H-reflex response across multiple stimulations and decreased persistence can indicate nerve or spinal cord dysfunction.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>H/M ratio:</bold> The ratio of the H-reflex amplitude to the maximal M-wave amplitude and it provides a normalized measure to assess reflex excitability.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent"><bold>Clinical applications</bold> of H-reflex testing are:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Assessment of nerve roots</bold> and it is commonly used to evaluate S1 radiculopathy, prolonged H-reflex latency suggests dysfunction in the S1 nerve root.</p></li>

<li><p class=""><bold>For monitoring and prognosis of nerve injuries</bold> or postsurgical conditions.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent"><span class="italic">Advantages</span> of H-reflex testing are that it is noninvasive and relatively simple to perform, it provides valuable information about proximal nerve segments and the spinal cord, and it complements other diagnostic tests like F-wave testing and EMG. <span class="italic">Disadvantages</span> or limitations of H-reflex testing are that the H-reflex is primarily measurable in certain muscles (e.g., soleus, flexor carpi radialis), limiting its applicability, it can be affected by factors like age, limb position, and patient relaxation and it requires skilled interpretation and comparison to normative data.</p>

<div class="section" id="ch5lev2sec32"><h2 class="title">F-wave Test</h2>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">F-wave test is an evoked response due to antidromically propagated action potentials transmitted to the anterior horn cells or initial segment of alpha motor neuron axons.</span> F-wave test is used when the disease or injury is thought to be in the proximal segment of nerves, for example, nerve compression in thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS).<a name="page167"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">167</span></span></p>
<p class="indent">The F-wave was first described in 1954 by the French neurologist Jean Laporte. He and his colleagues documented this late motor response as part of their studies on motor nerve conduction and spinal cord reflexes. Their work provided the foundation for using F-wave testing in clinical neurophysiology to assess the integrity of proximal nerve segments and motor pathways.</p>
<p class="indent">F-wave testing is a component of electromyography (EMG) and nerve conduction studies (NCS), used to evaluate motor nerve conduction and assess the integrity of the proximal segments of peripheral nerves. It is particularly valuable for diagnosing radiculopathies, peripheral neuropathies, and other disorders affecting motor nerves. The F-wave <bold>(<a href="#ch5fig21" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 5.21</a>)</bold> is a late motor response elicited by electrical stimulation of a motor nerve. Unlike the direct motor response (M-wave), the F-wave is generated when the electrical impulse travels antidromically (backward) along the motor nerve to the spinal cord and then orthodromically (forwards) back to the muscle. It is not a reflex but a secondarily evoked response.</p>
<p class="indent">The <bold>key features</bold> of the F-wave include:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Late latency:</bold> It occurs after the M-wave, with a latency reflecting the round-trip conduction time to and from the spinal cord.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Small amplitude:</bold> The amplitude of the F-wave is smaller than the M-wave, as it represents the activation of a subset of motor neurons.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Variability:</bold> F-wave latencies, shapes, and amplitudes can vary between successive stimulations.</p></li>
</ul>

<p class="noindent"><bold>Parameters:</bold> After the F-wave testing is done latency, amplitude, persistence, and chrono dispersion parameters are analyzed.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">

<div class="sidebar"><h2 class="title">Summary</h2>
<p class="">Electrodiagnostic tests include rheobase, chronaxie, strength-duration curve, pulse ratio, galvanic-tetanic ratio, nerve conduction test, nerve distribution test, nerve conduction velocity, faradic-galvanic test, etc. Strength-duration curve is a simple, reliable, and cheaper form of electrodiagnostic test. Following completed denervation, a reversal of the polar formula may occur. Electromyography is the study of the electrical activity of muscle by means of surface electrodes placed over the skin or needle electrodes inserted in the muscle itself. Normal EMG waveform is triphasic.</p>
