<p class="noindent">In the past, there were accidental reports of electrocution during diagnostic and routine treatment with machines that work on electricity. Although, there is not a single reliable and official statistic report available in our country, it seems sensible that extra caution must be taken whenever electrical safety codes and their implementation are not as strictly enforced as it is in more advanced countries.</p>
<p class="indent">I would like to share one of my experiences pertaining to the leakage of current. This patient was a pretty, married woman who had wrist pain. To alleviate her wrist pain, I started treating her with an electrically operated and programmed instrument, which could offer transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS). I used to put the electrodes first, then switch on the mains, set the parameters and increase the intensity. But when the treatment was over, this machine would reduce the intensity to zero automatically and hence, I tried to lift the electrodes and then switch off the machine. To my surprise, when I touched her forearm, I got a shock-like sensation. This happened successively for 3 days of treatment and then I shared this information with my colleagues who kept laughing at this situation.<a name="page259"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">259</span></span> I decided to check whether there was any leakage of current with the tester and to my surprise, the tester was glowing in both the output terminals of this machine where electrodes were to be connected. Then, we called an electrician who found that, there was real leakage due to heavy rain and some fault in the voltage stabilizer. Then I concluded that, compared to my patient, I was very sensitive to the leakage of current. Nowadays, I do not really get surprised with such things and I call the electrician immediately without fail.</p>
<p class="indent">A physiotherapist working in a hospital or a clinical setup frequently uses modalities, which are electrically operated. Therefore, there is a great need for the physiotherapist to be aware of the potential electrical hazards to patients as well as themselves. In 1998, I presented a paper based on questionnaire research, at the ‘Indian Association of Physiotherapists’ conference held in Thiruvananthapuram (36th IAP conference, 25th Jan 1998) on ‘Implication of Informed Consent in Electrotherapy.’ The outcome of this study was that, all the respondents (100%) felt that we should seek informed consent from patients prior to the use of electrotherapy modalities. Nearly 73.34% respondents felt that it would protect physiotherapists from malpractice as well as accidental hazards, while 20% felt that it would protect physiotherapists from only accidental hazards, whereas, 6.66% felt that it would protect physiotherapists from only malpractice. Since this study included only 30 physiotherapists and response rate was 50 percent, a major study in this aspect in the future may give us better insight.</p>
</div><div class="section" id="ch10lev1sec2"><h1 class="title">CAUSES AND TYPES OF HAZARDS</h1>
<p class="noindent">Various causes of electrical hazards are worn out power cords, broken plugs, faulty lamp sockets, incorrectly wired outlets, leakage of current, defect in circuit, absence of earthing, defective electrical receptacles or sockets, breakage of power cord, etc. <span class="italic">Types of hazards due to the use of electrotherapeutic modalities are electric shock, electrocution, thermal burns, electrochemical burns, scalds, etc.</span> Physiological effects of shock can vary with the magnitude of the current. With 0.1 milliamperes (mA), the shock is imperceptible; with 1 to 15 mA, it produces tingling sensation and muscle contractions; with 15 to 100 mA, it produces painful electrical shock; while with 100 to 200 mA, it can produce cardiac or respiratory arrest and with more than 200 mA, it produces instant tissue burning and destruction.</p>
<p class="indent">Electrotherapy is a powerful therapeutic tool used in physiotherapy to treat a variety of conditions. It involves the use of electrical currents to stimulate nerves, muscles, and tissues, providing benefits such as pain relief, muscle strengthening, and accelerated healing.<a name="page260"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">260</span></span> However, when not properly managed, electrotherapy can lead to potential hazards or adverse effects. Understanding the causes of these hazards is crucial for ensuring patient safety and the effectiveness of the treatment.</p>
<p class="indent">The following are the <bold>primary causes of hazards</bold> in electrotherapy:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class="">Faulty or poorly maintained electrotherapy machines can pose serious risks.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Malfunctions in the electrical circuitry, connections, or timers can result in delivering inappropriate current intensities, leading to burns, electrical shock, or inadequate treatment.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Electrodes and leads that are cracked, frayed, or exposed to moisture can create electrical short circuits or leakage of current, increasing the risk of burns, electric shock, or injury to the patient.</p></li>
<li><p class="">Broken or misaligned electrodes can also cause irregular current distribution, leading to ineffective treatment or unwanted adverse effects.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">Electrotherapy devices require regular calibration to ensure they are delivering the correct electrical parameters (e.g., voltage, current intensity, frequency). Improper calibration can result in delivering excessive or insufficient electrical energy, causing harm.</p>
<p class="indent">Some conditions or medical devices are <bold>contraindications</bold> for electrotherapy. For example, patients with pacemakers, defibrillators, or electronic implants should not undergo electrotherapy, as the electrical currents can interfere with the functioning of these devices, leading to potential harm. Pregnant women, patients with epilepsy, those with heart disease, or cancer in specific areas should also be carefully assessed to avoid potential hazards. Patients with reduced or absent sensation (e.g., in diabetic neuropathy) may not feel pain or discomfort during electrotherapy. This can result in undetected burns, irritation, or excessive intensity that can harm the skin or underlying tissues. Failure to continuously monitor the patient during electrotherapy sessions can result in overexposure to electrical currents. Patients may experience discomfort, burning sensations, or even severe adverse reactions such as tissue damage or burns if left unchecked. Incorrect placement of electrodes can result in improper current flow, leading to ineffective treatment or unintended stimulation of areas like the heart or nerves. For instance, placing electrodes near the cardiac region or eyes can be hazardous. Additionally, placing electrodes over open wounds, infections, or broken skin can aggravate the condition or lead to further injury.<a name="page261"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">261</span></span> Setting the intensity too high can cause excessive tissue stimulation, leading to burns, skin irritation, or muscle spasms. Conversely, setting the intensity too low may fail to provide the desired therapeutic effect. It is essential to start with lower intensity settings and gradually increase them based on patient comfort and tolerance. Electrotherapy should be applied within the recommended duration for each specific modality. Prolonged exposure to electrical currents can lead to tissue overheating, burns, or muscle fatigue. Treatment times should be monitored closely and adjusted as needed. Therapists who are not adequately trained in the use of electrotherapy equipment may inadvertently cause harm to patients. Lack of understanding about the different modalities, their indications, and the proper techniques for applying electrical stimulation can result in improper treatment application. Practitioners should be well-versed in the basic principles of electrotherapy, the settings for each modality, and potential complications that may arise during treatment. Failing to recognize contraindications and patient-specific risks (e.g., pacemakers, epilepsy) can result in administering electrotherapy to patients who are not suitable candidates. This oversight can lead to life-threatening complications, such as arrhythmias or seizures. Electrotherapy should never be applied in damp or wet environments. Water or moisture can lead to electrical short circuits, posing a significant risk of electric shock to both the patient and the therapist. Using electrotherapy equipment near water sources or in areas of high humidity can also damage the device, increasing the risk of malfunction.</p>
<p class="indent">Certain types of electrotherapies, such as shortwave diathermy (SWD), generate heat. In rooms without adequate ventilation, excessive heat may build up, potentially causing burns or overheating of the equipment. Electrotherapy equipment must be plugged into properly grounded outlets to avoid electrical hazards. Using ungrounded equipment can result in the risk of electrical shock to the patient or practitioner. Patients must be fully informed about the electrotherapy treatment being administered, including its goals, benefits, risks, and potential side effects. Failing to obtain informed consent can result in patients feeling unprepared or unsafe during treatment. Patients should be educated on the sensations they may experience during electrotherapy (e.g., tingling, mild discomfort, or muscle contractions). Misunderstanding or failing to communicate these sensations can lead to unnecessary fear or alarm, or the patient may misinterpret discomfort as pain, leading to incorrect adjustments in settings.<a name="page262"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">262</span></span> <span class="italic">Burns are one of the most common hazards associated with electrotherapy</span>. These can occur when the electrical current is too high, or the electrodes are left in place for too long, causing excessive heating of the skin or underlying tissues. Skin irritation and blisters can also develop if electrodes are improperly placed or if the patient has sensitive skin. Prolonged or intense stimulation can lead to muscle fatigue, spasms, or even muscle strains, particularly with high-frequency or strong currents used in electrical muscle stimulation (EMS). Monitoring intensity levels and session durations can prevent this from occurring. Although rare, electrical shock can occur if the equipment is malfunctioning, improperly grounded, or used inappropriately. This is especially concerning when devices are not properly maintained or when safety features, such as surge protectors, are bypassed.</p>
</div><div class="section" id="ch10lev1sec3"><h1 class="title">SAFETY PRECAUTIONS TO BE FOLLOWED</h1>
<p class="noindent">There are numerous safety precautions, and it may be difficult to remember them. For ease of understanding, these precautions are divided into areas such as equipment purchase, earthing and voltage stabilizer, maintenance and safety precautions to be taken by the physiotherapist.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch10lev2sec1"><h2 class="title">Equipment Purchase</h2>
<p class="noindent">Do not buy the cheapest equipment since they may be the most expensive to operate. Read the instruction manual carefully before operating. Check the unit at the time of delivery and if there is any defect, then exchange the unit immediately. Ask for regular performance and safety checks as a condition of purchase of the equipment.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch10lev2sec2"><h2 class="title">Equipment Safety</h2>
<p class="noindent">Electrotherapy devices must be regularly inspected, calibrated, and maintained according to the manufacturer's instructions to prevent malfunction. Worn-out leads, electrodes, or malfunctioning equipment can lead to electric shocks or burns. Ensure that all electrotherapy devices are plugged into grounded outlets to avoid electrical hazards. Extension cords should be avoided, as they may not support the proper electrical current. Electrodes should be placed in appropriate locations based on the type of therapy being used. Incorrect placement may result in ineffective treatment or cause harm to the patient. The intensity of the electrical current should be set appropriately based on the treatment goals and the patient's tolerance. The therapist should start with lower intensities and gradually increase them, ensuring the patient is comfortable throughout the procedure. The duration of electrotherapy sessions should not exceed the recommended time for each modality, as prolonged exposure can cause tissue damage or burns.<a name="page263"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">263</span></span></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch10lev2sec3"><h2 class="title">Earthing and Stabilizer</h2>
<p class="noindent">There should be proper earthing connected to all the electrotherapy equipment working on electricity. Ground fault interrupter circuit should be used. You should have either separate or central voltage stabilizer for your clinic or department, so as to avoid voltage surge and thereby discomfort to the patient while receiving electrical stimulation, whimsical performance by the equipment and damage to the equipment. In one situation, traction machine (with microprocessor circuit) pulled one of the patient's neck with maximal weight than what it was assigned to do, due to voltage surge. Switches should break the live wire. Fuses should be on live wire so that, if a large current passes then the fuse blows and stops the current flow.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch10lev2sec4"><h2 class="title">Maintenance</h2>
<p class="noindent">Try to have a maintenance contract with the manufacturers for yearly services after the warranty period. Routine maintenance check-up should be performed on all electrical equipment. Yearly maintenance check-up by biomedical engineers should be done. Dated inspection sticker should be affixed to all electrical units.</p>
<p class="indent">Electrotherapy equipment plays a crucial role in physiotherapy by delivering electrical currents for therapeutic purposes, including pain relief, muscle stimulation, and tissue repair. Proper maintenance of electrotherapy equipment is essential to ensure its functionality, effectiveness, and safety for both patients and practitioners. Neglecting maintenance can lead to equipment malfunction, inaccurate treatment delivery, and potential hazards such as electrical shocks, burns, or injuries. This guide outlines key aspects of electrotherapy equipment maintenance, emphasizing preventive measures, inspection protocols, and best practices. Properly maintained equipment minimizes the risk of burns, electrical shocks, and other adverse effects. It ensures the accurate delivery of electrical currents, preventing overexposure or underexposure. Regular maintenance reduces wear and tear, enhancing the longevity of the device. Functional equipment ensures that therapy sessions achieve the desired therapeutic outcomes without interruptions or inaccuracies. Well-maintained equipment meets safety and operational standards set by regulatory bodies, reducing the risk of legal liabilities.<a name="page264"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">264</span></span></p>

<div class="section" id="ch10lev2sec5"><h2 class="title">Patient Assessment</h2>
<p class="noindent">Before initiating electrotherapy, a thorough assessment of the patient's health history should be carried out. Conditions such as pacemakers, epilepsy, pregnancy, and cardiac arrhythmias are contraindications for certain electrotherapy modalities. Electrotherapy should not be applied to areas with broken skin, open wounds, or infections to avoid exacerbating these conditions or causing further injury. Electrotherapy should not be applied if a patient has compromised sensation in the treatment area, as they may not be able to feel if the intensity is too high, leading to burns or other injuries.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch10lev2sec6"><h2 class="title">Patient Safety During Treatment</h2>
<p class="noindent">Patients should be monitored throughout the session for any signs of discomfort, irritation, or adverse effects. Immediate action should be taken if the patient reports pain, burning, dizziness, or any unusual sensations. Proper patient positioning is crucial to avoid injury. Electrotherapy should never be applied while a patient is in a position that could lead to falls, muscle strain, or injury. Patients should be supervised during treatment, particularly if they are new to electrotherapy. They should be informed about the procedure and advised not to move or touch the equipment during the session.<a name="page266"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">266</span></span></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch10lev2sec7"><h2 class="title">Therapist Training and Competency</h2>
<p class="noindent">Only trained and qualified physiotherapists should administer electrotherapy. Therapists must be familiar with the devices they use, the parameters for each modality, and the safety precautions specific to each type of electrotherapy. Electrotherapy techniques and technologies continue to evolve. Physiotherapists should engage in regular professional development and training to stay updated on new safety guidelines and best practices.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch10lev2sec8"><h2 class="title">Physiotherapist's Role in Safety</h2>
<p class="noindent">The physiotherapist should not use the electrical equipment near objects or environment that draw the current. Post-sign notifying usage of equipment that interfere with pacemakers and hearing aids. Inspect the skin after every treatment. Unplug units that are not in use. Familiarize yourself with problems of electrical hazards. Physiotherapist who does not have sufficient knowledge and experience on electrical matters, should not attempt to personally repair equipment failures, however minor they are. Call experts like your hospital electrician or biomedical engineer to check the equipment for breakage. Equipment with questionable performance is noted, labeled, turned off and disconnected immediately from the patient. Avoid use of extension cords. Never use cheater adopters allowing three pronged plugs to be used in two prong receptacles. Use of undergrounded electrical equipment must be avoided. Disconnect the instrument from the wall socket by pulling the connector and not the cable. Avoid spilling of water or normal saline during electrical stimulation over the stimulator. Use surgical rubber gloves while handling ultrasound for underwater technique. Use the tester for leakage of current. Attend seminars and lectures dealing with electrical safety. Keep updated information about new instruments. Whenever you buy new equipment, read the instruction manual or get the necessary training before operating it. Frequently check the integrity of plug cords, electrical stimulation leads for fraying or disruption. Report the loose gripping connections between plug and receptacles and get it repaired. Do not permit your patient to touch the apparatus during the treatment. Take special care when you administer the treatment through bath, as there is always possibility of easy earth connections. The bath must be of an insulating material and leaking bath tray or tub or tank should not be used.<a name="page267"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">267</span></span></p>
<div class="sidebar"><h2 class="title">Summary</h2>
<p class="">Various causes of electrical hazards are worn out power cords, broken plugs, faulty lamp sockets, incorrectly wired outlets, leakage of current, defects in circuits, absence of earthing, defective electrical receptacles or sockets, breakage of power cord, etc. With 0.1 mA, the shock is imperceptible, with 1 to 15 mA, it produces tingling sensations and muscle contractions. With 15 to 100 mA, it produces painful electrical shock, with 100 to 200 mA, it can produce cardiac or respiratory arrest and with more than 200 mA, it produces instant tissue burning and destruction. There should be proper earthing connected to all the electrotherapy equipment working on electricity. Routine maintenance check-up should be performed on all electrical equipment.</p>
