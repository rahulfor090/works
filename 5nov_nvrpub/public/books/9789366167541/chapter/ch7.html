<div class="section" id="ch7lev2sec1"><h2 class="title">Introduction</h2>
<p class="noindent">The therapeutic use of ultrasound in electrotherapy physiotherapy was first described by <bold>Lloyd FM Shaw</bold> in the 1950s. He is credited with pioneering the application of ultrasound for therapeutic purposes, such as tissue healing, pain relief, and muscle relaxation, in physiotherapy practice. Shaw's work laid the foundation for the widespread use of ultrasound as a modality in electrotherapy.</p>
<p class="indent">We can hear someone when he is talking to us. You can also hear melodious music from a stereo and if you like, then you can hear the beating of a drum. It is possible for us to hear all these things because of the sound waves, which vibrate the matter and produce sound. You can very well hear sound waves but cannot see them. We, human beings, hear the sound waves by our ears, but there is limit to this. The limit is in the form of frequency, we can hear the sound waves with a frequency of &lt;20 KHz. The dictionary meaning of the word <span class="italic">‘ultra’</span> is <span class="italic">beyond</span>. Since ultrasound waves are beyond the audible capacity of the human ear, it justifies the name ultrasound instead of sound. Ultrasound can be defined as a form of acoustic vibrations occurring at a frequency that is too high to be perceived by the human ear.<a name="page203"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">203</span></span></p>
<p class="indent">For the physiotherapeutic purpose, ultrasound with a frequency range of 0.5 to 5 MHz is used. Most commonly, 1 MHz frequency is used all over the world for physiotherapy, but in few countries even 3 MHz is used. In ultrasound treatment, stream of the pressure waves is transmitted to a small volume of tissue, which causes the molecules of the tissue to vibrate. Mechanical pressure wave of ultrasound is applied to the tissues at a level of intensity that is so low and at a frequency that is so rapid that the person receiving it cannot detect the pressure. Historically, in the 1920s, ultrasound had been used for underwater detection. However, then it was observed that extreme pressure waves were damaging the living tissues. This led to the first use of ultrasound in medicine, for the treatment of cancer. During 1930s, lower intensities of ultrasound were used for the first time in physical medicine to treat soft tissue conditions with mild heating. Ultrasonic therapy is better than most of the other electrotherapeutic treatments because of its effective depth of penetration. Hence, ultrasound is one of the most commonly used physiotherapeutic modalities.</p>

<div class="section" id="ch7lev2sec2"><h2 class="title">Production</h2>
<div class="section" id="ch7lev3sec1"><h3 class="title">Principle of Production</h3>
<p class="noindent">It is not possible to produce ultrasound waves by mechanical means and hence, they are produced by the application of rapid alternating current to the crystal of piezoelectric substances. For this purpose, crystal of quartz, barium titanate, lead zirconate, germanium, etc., can be used. These crystals can produce ultrasonic waves on the basis of reverse piezoelectric effect. In 1888, Pierre and Marie Curie described the piezoelectric effect. The meaning of the word piezo is pressure. Application of pressure, compression or deformation to the crystal produces the electric changes in the crystal. In 1910, Langevin described the reverse piezoelectric effect. <span class="italic">Reverse piezoelectric effect is the application of electricity or potential difference across the</span> <span class="italic">crystal, which produces oscillations or deformation or pressure changes in the crystal</span>. From the ultrasonic point of view, the reverse piezoelectric effect is the production of high frequency oscillations, from the crystal of piezoelectric substances, by the application of high frequency current (<bold>Mnemonic:</bold> ‘HFO of crystal’ by HFC).<a name="page204"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">204</span></span></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch7lev3sec2"><h3 class="title">Functional Parts</h3>
<p class="noindent">The functional parts of the ultrasonic generator are oscillator circuit, controlling circuit, resistance circuit, coaxial cable, crystal and transducer. Oscillator circuit produces high frequency alternating current, resistance circuit controls the amplitude of the ultrasound waves by controlling the amplitude of high frequency alternating currents and controlling circuit produces the pulsed output. In addition to this, there is a coaxial cable, which transfers the high frequency current from the generator to the crystal. Crystal acts as the source of ultrasound waves. Transducer or the head serves as an applicator. Refer to <bold><a href="#ch7fig1" class="ulink-inter">Figure 7.1</a></bold> for the block diagram.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch7lev3sec3"><h3 class="title">Parameters</h3>
<p class="noindent">Various controlling knobs or the parameters of ultrasound machine are mains, timer, intensity or output, meter, space ratio, etc. The function of:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Mains:</bold> It is to switch on or off the machine.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Timer:</bold> It is to adjust the treatment time.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Output knob:</bold> It is to adjust the intensity of sound waves.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Meter:</bold> It is to help to measure the dose.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Space ratio:</bold> It can be adjusted as per the requirement, usually higher output and less interval is preferred in chronic and reverse in case of acute. Hence, in short, we can summarize it as 1:1 for chronic and 1:4 for acute, and so on.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch7lev3sec4"><h3 class="title">Working</h3>
<p class="noindent">When power is supplied to the circuit, then oscillator circuit produces the high frequency current. Pulse mode switches on the controlling circuit and produces interrupted or pulsed output. The power or output is then controlled by means of the resistance circuit.</p>
<p class="indent">The high frequency current produced by the generator is fed to the crystal via the coaxial cable. It is applied by means of metal electrodes on either side of the crystal, say, top and bottom of it. Application of high frequency current cause repeated oscillations of crystal with a high frequency and produce ultrasound waves. On the front side of the crystal, metal plate or the diaphragm of the transducer is located and on the backside of it, there is an air column.</p>

<p class="noindent">The air column on the backside causes the emission of ultrasonic waves mostly from the front side or the treatment aspect of the transducer. Therapeutic ultrasound machine is shown in <bold><a href="#ch7fig2" class="ulink-inter">Figure 7.2</a>.</bold></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch7lev2sec3"><h2 class="title">Physiological Effects</h2>
<div class="section" id="ch7lev3sec5"><h3 class="title">Thermal Effects</h3>
<p class="noindent">When ultrasound waves are applied to the body tissues, those tissues absorb them. As a result of absorption of ultrasound waves, heat is produced inside the body tissue. This heat may be produced because of the conversion of the sonic energy into thermal energy. If heat dissipation equals generation, then there is no net rise in the local temperature and the effect is said to be nonthermal. On the other hand, if heat dissipation is less than the generation, then there is net rise in the local temperature and the effect is said to be thermal. Various thermal effects are increased peripheral arterial blood flow, increased tissue metabolism, increased permeability of membrane, increased pain threshold, increased sensitivity of C-type of nerve fibers, relief of muscle spasm, increased vascularity of skin due to stimulation of sympathetic fibers, increased tendon extensibility and may produce pathological fractures in bone with excessive dosages. It is also said that ultrasound may not have any beneficial effect on fracture healing.</p>
<p class="indent">The amount of the heat produced due to insonation depends on various factors such as, intensity, mode, duration of insonation, space ratio, reflection of sound waves inside the tissues, protein content, etc.<a name="page206"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">206</span></span> If the intensity is higher, then there is more heat production. If the duration of insonation or ultrasound application is higher then, there is more heat production inside the body tissues. If there is more reflection of the ultrasound waves inside the body tissues, then there is more rise in local heat. Tissues with higher protein content absorb more ultrasound and hence, there is more production of heat if the protein content of the tissues is higher. The amount of the heat developed is more in continuous mode as compared to pulsed mode. In case of pulsed mode, it depends on space ratio and the heat production is more if space ratio is 1:1 than when it is 1:4 or 1:7. Heat produced is likely to be better, if reflection is greater as a result of adding effect of propagation and reflected back waves. It occurs at interfaces of periosteum and bone, which are separated by a thin layer of air. As a result of reflection, localized overheating at periosteum level may occur and may lead to periosteal pain or hot spots and hence, during the treatment subcutaneous bony prominences may be avoided. Heating effect is also likely to be increased because of friction between ultrasound head and body tissue, nonmoving ultrasound head, and if ultrasound is used continuously, repeatedly without allowing sufficient time to cool off the ultrasound machine.</p>
<p class="indent">Thermal effect increases vasodilation, cell activity, blood supply and removes waste products and thereby facilitates resolution of inflammation and promotes healing. The thermal effect also causes increase in extensibility of fibrous tissues such as ligaments, joint capsule and scar tissues.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch7lev3sec6"><h3 class="title">Mechanical Effects</h3>
<p class="noindent">Mechanical or nonthermal effects of therapeutic ultrasound are acoustic streaming, micromassage, standing waves and cavitations.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><bold>Acoustic streaming:</bold> Unidirectional flow of tissue fluids as a result of insonation is termed as acoustic streaming. Acoustic streaming increases permeability of cells.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Micromassage:</bold> Acoustic vibrations due to insonation produce a form of micromassage effect in the tissues.</p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Standing waves:</bold> Stationary or standing waves pattern of ultrasonic waves may develop, if there is cancellation effect of propagating and reflected waves. Standing waves may produce blood cell stasis in the vessels and hence measures like, moving the ultrasound head during the treatment or using pulsed form, etc., should be taken, to prevent the formation of standing waves pattern in the body tissues.<a name="page207"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">207</span></span></p></li>
<li><p class=""><bold>Cavitations:</bold> It is the formation of tiny gas bubbles in the tissues as a result of insonation. The size of these gas bubbles is of a micron. Cavitations may be stable or transient. In <span class="italic">stable cavitations</span>, gas bubbles remain intact; size of bubbles does not change and there is no considerable pressure and temperature change. On the contrary, in case of <span class="italic">transient cavitations</span> there is rapid change in the volume of bubbles. Collapsing of these bubbles causes considerable pressure and temperature changes and hence transient cavitations can cause gross damage to the tissues. To prevent the occurrence of cavitations, adequate pressure with transducer should be exerted during the application, pulsed output can be used, only suggested levels of insonation should be used and any sort of discomfort to the patient should be avoided during the treatment.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch7lev3sec7"><h3 class="title">Chemical Effects</h3>
<p class="noindent">Insonation enhances chemical reactions and processes occurring at tissue level. The effect may be similar to a test tube shake in the laboratory.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch7lev2sec4"><h2 class="title">Therapeutic Effects</h2>
<p class="noindent">Therapeutic effects of insonation are pain relief, resolution of inflammation and acceleration of healing.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch7lev3sec8"><h3 class="title">Pain Relief</h3>
<p class="noindent">Pain can be relieved by ultrasonic therapy. Insonation can be used for the relief of acute, subacute and chronic musculoskeletal pain. Exactly, how it causes pain relief is not known. It may be due to thermal or nonthermal effects. Pain relief may occur due to resolution of inflammation, removal of waste products or altered permeability of cell membrane to sodium, which may alter the electrical activity or pain threshold.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch7lev3sec9"><h3 class="title">Resolution of Inflammation</h3>
<p class="noindent">Insonation helps in the resolution of inflammation by increasing blood supply, white blood cells and removal of waste products. Hence, it can be used in the treatment of inflammatory conditions and traumatic conditions to reduce the inflammation and prevent adhesions of soft tissues.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch7lev3sec10"><h3 class="title">Effect on Healing/Repair</h3>
<p class="noindent">Healing may occur by repair or regeneration. Repair is the replacement of damaged cells by some other cells, which are not exactly similar in structure and function.<a name="page208"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">208</span></span> Regeneration is the replacement of damaged cells by the same cells, which are same in structure and function. Human beings have lost their power of regeneration during the evolutionary process and very little regeneration occurs in human beings. Ultrasound facilitates the healing at all the three stages of repair. During inflammatory phase, insonation increases the fragility of lysosomes. As a result, there is release of autolytic enzymes. These autolytic enzymes clear the debris. In proliferative phase, ultrasound increases the proliferation of fibroblasts and myofibroblasts.</p>
<p class="indent">Myofibroblasts are the cells, which contain fibril-like structure. In remodeling phase, ultrasound facilitates remodeling of new tissues.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch7lev2sec5"><h2 class="title">Therapeutic Uses</h2>
<p class="noindent">Therapeutic ultrasound has been applied to a vast range of conditions. Few of the conditions, in which successful outcome is likely to occur are; bursitis, tendonitis, plantar fasciitis, plantar warts, calcaneal spur, tennis elbow, golfer's elbow, sacroiliitis, coccydynia, low back pain, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, fibrous nodules, rheumatic nodules, venous ulcers, scars, pressure sores, Dupuytren's contracture, later stages of myositis ossificans, phantom limb pain, frozen shoulder, temporomandibular joint syndrome, Bell's palsy, sports injuries, surgical wounds, episiotomies, capsulitis, joint contractures, deep-seated muscle spasm, calcific tendonitis, exostosis, causalgia, Sudeck's atrophy, Peyronie's disease, dislocations, sprains, etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch7lev2sec6"><h2 class="title">Contraindications</h2>
<p class="noindent">Therapeutic ultrasound is contraindicated over metal implants, plastic implants such as high-density polyethylene, acrylic implant and implanted cardiac pacemakers. Insonation over these implants may be harmful because of maximum absorption of acoustic vibrations, increased heat production and interference with the function of implants. Insonation is also contraindicated over specialized tissues such as eyes, ears, ovaries or testes, as it may have harmful effects, such as cavitations and may lead to irreparable damage.</p>
<p class="indent">An area, where there is presence of vascular problems such as hemorrhage, hematoma, hemarthrosis, hemophilia, thrombosis, thrombophlebitis, embolism, arteriosclerosis and ischemia should not be treated with ultrasound. Insonation should not be applied in the infected area, as there is possibility of spreading of infection to the deeper level or to other patients through cross-contamination. In tuberculous lesion, it may reactivate the dormant capsular lesion. High doses of ultrasound should not be given over anesthetic areas, to avoid possible skin damage because of heat.<a name="page209"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">209</span></span></p>
<p class="indent">Ultrasound should not be applied to areas that have received radiotherapy within the last 6 months, as it may cause more devitalization of the tissues. Ultrasound therapy over tumor/neoplasm should be avoided as it may cause metastases. Treatment over or near the abdomen of pregnant patient with ultrasound should be avoided because it may produce untoward effects. Ultrasound therapy over spina bifida is generally avoided as it may have an adverse effect on spinal cord. Similarly, treatment over cervical ganglia or vagus nerve is dangerous in patients who suffer from cardiac diseases.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch7lev2sec7"><h2 class="title">Dangers and Precautions</h2>
<p class="noindent">Various dangers like thermal burns, cavitations, overdose, damage to the ultrasound machine, etc., are likely to occur during insonation. However, these dangers can be minimized or prevented by taking some precautions. Various precautions to be taken while treating a patient are: Check the thermal sensation prior to the ultrasound application, use the suggested levels of ultrasound dosages, move the ultrasound head, avoid superficial bony prominences, avoid excess sensation of heat during the treatment, do not keep the ultrasound head in air when the output is on, maintain perfect contact between the ultrasound head and the body tissues, etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch7lev2sec8"><h2 class="title">Methods of Application</h2>
<p class="noindent">Various methods by which insonation can be applied are bath method, bag method and contact cream method (<bold>Mnemonic</bold>: ‘BBC’ where B: bath, B: bag and C: contact cream).</p>
<div class="section" id="ch7lev3sec11"><h3 class="title">Bath Method</h3>
<p class="noindent">Insonation by bath method is also known as <bold>subaqueous method</bold> of application. In bath method, insonation is applied to the body part through the water in a tub, tray or tank. This method of application can be used for the treatment of hand, forearm, foot and leg. In this method, ultrasound head is placed in water and moved parallel to the body part to be treated at about 1 to 2 millimeters away from the skin. Alternatively, ultrasonic head can be just kept stationary in the water container.<a name="page210"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">210</span></span></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch7lev3sec12"><h3 class="title">Bag Method</h3>
<p class="noindent">In bag method, a plastic rubber bag filled with degassed water is placed over the body part to be treated. First, couplant is smeared on the surface of bag, skin and treatment head and then the treatment head is moved over water bag. It is used for irregular surface, which cannot conventionally be placed in water. Higher output may be required due to the presence of two interfaces, one between the ultrasonic head and bag, and the other between bag and the body part.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch7lev3sec13"><h3 class="title">Contact Cream Method</h3>
<p class="noindent">Contact cream method of ultrasound application is quite commonly used. It is also vaguely called <bold>direct method</bold>. However, ultrasound cannot be applied directly to the body part since there are chances of reflections of ultrasound and uneven transmission without couplant. A couplant is any intervening material medium between ultrasound head and body tissue which offers perfect contact of head to the body tissue and allow maximum transmission of sonic waves. Various ultrasonic couplants used are boiled or degassed water, glycerine, oils, liquid paraffin and various ultrasonic gels commercially available for this purpose. Commercially available ultrasonic gels are thixotropic in nature, that is they liquefy very easily. In addition to this, they are attractive in color, less corrosive to the skin, allow perfect contact between the ultrasonic head and the body tissues, allow satisfactory transmission, they can be easily wiped out and are somewhat cheaper too.</p>
<p class="indent">In contact cream or the direct method <bold>(<a href="#ch7fig3" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 7.3</a>)</bold>, coupling material such as ultrasonic gel is applied to the skin and the ultrasound head is moved over the area to be treated. This method is satisfactory for even body surfaces. During insonation with this method, ultrasonic head should be kept in perfect contact with body tissues, head should be kept at right angle to the body surface treated and adequate pressure should be exerted.</p>
<div class="figure" id="ch7fig3" data-label="Fig. 7.3"><div class="title"><span class="item-label">Fig. 7.3</span> Contact cream method.</div><img alt="Fig. 7.3" src="/MediumImage/210-1.jpg"><div class="additional-markup"></div></div>

</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch7lev2sec9"><h2 class="title">Testing of Ultrasound Machine</h2>
<p class="noindent">Ultrasound machine can be tested prior to its use for the treatment purpose, to ensure that it is working properly and emitting the ultrasonic waves. It can be tested by various ways.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch7lev3sec14"><h3 class="title">Water Drops Method</h3>
<p class="noindent">Here, few drops of water are splashed on the surface of the treatment head and then the output is increased momentarily. It will cause the vibration of water, which appears as if it is boiling.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch7lev3sec15"><h3 class="title">Container Method</h3>
<p class="noindent">Apply the ultrasonic gel on the bottom of a suitable container and fill it with water. Place the treatment head under the bottom of the container. It produces ripple-like appearance in the water when output is increased.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch7lev3sec16"><h3 class="title">Thenar Eminence</h3>
<p class="noindent">Apply ultrasonic gel to your left thenar eminence. Keep the ultrasound head over this, increase the output and move the ultrasound head slowly in a circular fashion after adjusting the output by right hand. You may feel slight warmth, which suggest that the ultrasound is working properly.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ch7lev2sec10"><h2 class="title">Dosages</h2>
<p class="noindent">In <span class="italic">acute conditions</span>, the dose should be 0.25 to 0.5 watts/cm<sup>2</sup> for 2 to 3 minutes. In <span class="italic">chronic conditions</span>, it can be increased to 0.8 to 2 watts/cm<sup>2</sup>. Use 3 MHz for superficial lesions and 1 MHz for deep lesions. Any strict guidelines about the number of treatments, is not there. But usually up to 12 treatments on every day or on alternate days can be given and after 12 treatments insonation should be stopped for at least a week before once again repeating it. Alternatively, you can watch the patient's symptoms and if patient complains of deep bone pain, then it suggests that there is overdose. In case of overdose, occasionally the patient may have general symptoms such as fever. Following overdose, you can reduce the intensity of application on subsequent treatments, reduce the treatment time or stop the treatment with ultrasound.</p>
</div>
</div><div class="section" id="ch7lev1sec2"><h1 class="title">PULSED ULTRASOUND</h1>
<p class="noindent">During the early use of this modality, only continuous ultrasound was used, and the intensity was selected in such a way that it produced appreciable thermal change.<a name="page212"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">212</span></span> But slowly it was recognized that nonthermal effects can have more mechanical effects and direct effects on the nerves, and hence the use of lower intensity and the pulsed form came into practice. In the pulsed form of therapeutic ultrasound, the output of ultrasound commences and ceases at regular interval. The pulse duration and the interval can be adjusted by pulse ratio. The pulse ratio is the ratio of pulse length duration of each pulse to the interval duration in successive pulses.</p>
<p class="indent">Various pulse ratios commonly used are 1:1, 1:4, 1:7 and 1:10. Usually, the pulse duration is 2 milliseconds, but the pulse interval can be varied in the multiples of two millisecond, to get different ratios. When the pulse ratio is 1:1 then the output of each pulse is 2 millisecond and the interval between the pulses is also 2 milliseconds, when the pulse ratio is 1:4 that means, output is 2 milliseconds, but the pulse interval is 8 milliseconds. Pulse ratio is often termed as space ratio. Alternatively, the space ratio can also be expressed in terms of duty cycle, which is the ratio of the pulse length to the total length of the pulse, plus pulse interval. Thus, when we choose the pulse ratio of 1:4 that means, 2 millisecond pulse duration and 8 millisecond pulse intervals then, it means the duty cycle will be 20 percent.</p>
<p class="indent">Pulsed ultrasound produces very minimal thermal effects, but it produces maximum mechanical or nonthermal effects. Hence, pulsed output of the ultrasound is preferred in acute conditions, bony prominences, for phonophoresis, for mechanical effects, as in case of scars and adhesions and in an area of the treatment, where the satisfactory movement of transducer is not possible as in case of coccydynia (<bold>Mnemonic</bold>: <bold>‘SP, BAM’</bold> where S: satisfactory movement of head impossible, P: phonophoresis, B: bone, A: acute and M: mechanical effects).</p>
</div><div class="section" id="ch7lev1sec3"><h1 class="title">PHONOPHORESIS</h1>
<p class="noindent"><span class="italic">Phonophoresis is the transfer of drugs in ointment or gel form through the skin under the influence of ultrasound</span>. It is also called <span class="italic">ultra sonophoresis</span> or <span class="italic">sonophoresis</span>. The initial reports about this technique appeared in 1960s and 70s. Phonophoresis is believed to be an effective method of transferring the medication into an area without having to undergo painful and sometimes poorly placed injections. By this technique, the hazard of injection and accompanying apprehension can be avoided. Phonophoresis with hydrocortisone can be used in psoriasis, scleroderma, pruritus and chronic tendonitis. Phonophoresis with iodine is recommended in scars, adhesive joint disorders, calcific deposits, etc.<a name="page213"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">213</span></span></p>
<p class="indent">Phonophoresis with lidocaine can be used for local anesthetic effect. Phonophoresis with salicylate ointment can be used for pain relief in various musculoskeletal conditions. Piroxicam ointment for pain relief, gives satisfactory results. For phonophoresis, use lower frequencies such as 1 MHz, pulsed output, higher concentration of the drug and easily soluble drugs so that the desired effect can be achieved.</p>
<div class="section" id="ch7lev2sec11"><h2 class="title">Advantages</h2>

<p class="noindent">To achieve treatment goals, therapeutic ultrasound can be applied in combination with another modality and this technique of applying two modalities together is termed as combination therapy. Ultrasound can be combined with surged faradic current, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), interferential current and iontophoresis. The concept of ultrasound and iontophoresis has a lot of practical limitations. Ultrasound with surged faradic current or single channel TENS or bipolar interferential current can be applied by placing one electrode over the convenient area and connecting the other electrode to the ultrasound applicator, by means of an alligator pin or through the machine, if such facility is available in the ultrasonic machine. Bearing in mind the different treatment durations of ultrasound and TENS, interferential current and faradic stimulation, this technique may not be very effective. <bold>Advantages</bold> of combination therapy includes, synergistic effects of both modalities, customizable treatment protocols, reduces reliance on medications and noninvasive and painless.<a name="page215"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">215</span></span></p>

<p class="noindent">The word extracorporeal means outside the body and refers to the fact that the shockwaves are generated outside the body. Extracorporeal shockwaves are the pressure waves generated outside the body that can be focused on at a specific site within the body. Shockwaves are characterized by high positive pressures from 5 to 100 MPa for 10 milliseconds, that is over 100 times atmospheric pressure. The energy pulse quite literally breaks the sound barrier, and this is what creates the shockwave. A shockwave is an intense, but very short energy wave traveling faster than the speed of sound. Types of ESWT includes <span class="italic">focused EST</span> and <span class="italic">radial ESWT</span>.</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: bullet">
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Focused EST</span> has high-energy waves with a precise focal point, penetrates deeper tissues (up to 12 cm) and it is suitable for chronic and deep-seated conditions (e.g., tendinopathies, bone healing).</p></li>
<li><p class=""><span class="italic">Radial ESWT</span> has lower-energy waves that spread over a wider area and it is effective for superficial conditions and large treatment areas (e.g., muscle trigger points).</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="indent">The basic science behind ESWT is analogous to <bold>lithotripsy</bold>, the technology that uses acoustic shockwaves to break up kidney stones without surgery. The technique of using shockwaves to break up kidney stones has been around for nearly a quarter century now, and in the process of treating thousands and thousands of patients, it was found that many people undergoing the procedure had other unrelated aches and pains disappear. It was at this point that scientists began to consider that shockwaves may have an effect to heal other sorts of tissues. Specialized machines were then developed specifically with the idea of using these shockwaves on other parts of the body, and this was the origin of ESWT for other conditions. ESWT was commonly used in the past for the treatment of kidney stones, but in more recent years, this type of technology has become popular in the treatment of musculoskeletal conditions.<a name="page216"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">216</span></span></p>
<div class="section" id="ch7lev2sec13"><h2 class="title">Mechanism of Action</h2>
<p class="noindent">There are a couple of theories, as to how ESWT helps promote healing. The most accepted one is that the microtrauma of the repeated shockwave to the affected area creates neovascularization into the area and neovascularization promotes tissue healing. The second theory is that shockwave therapy induces acute inflammatory response that promotes healing. High-energy acoustic waves penetrate the tissues, creating mechanical stress that stimulates cellular repair and regeneration. Controlled microtrauma promotes neovascularization (formation of new blood vessels) and increases blood flow to the area. Reduces pain through gate control theory since shock waves inhibit pain signals to the brain, substance p (pain) since it lowers levels of this pain mediator, hyperstimulation analgesia since it alters nerve activity to reduce sensitivity. Dissolves calcifications and scar tissue in conditions like tendinitis or plantar fasciitis.</p>

<div class="section" id="ch7lev2sec14"><h2 class="title">Indications</h2>
<p class="noindent">Presently, ESWT is recommended for plantar fasciitis, tennis elbow, plantar heel spurs <bold>(<a href="#ch7fig4" class="ulink-inter">Fig. 7.4</a>)</bold>, supra- and infrapatellar tendonitis, calcific tendonitis of shoulder, supraspinatus tendonitis, Achilles tendonitis, tendo-Achilles tendinitis, patellar tendonitis (Jumper's knee), myofascial pain syndrome, trigger points, pseudoarthrosis, stress fractures, delayed union or nonunion fractures, stress fractures, Morton's neuroma, Peyronie's disease, cellulite reduction for aesthetic uses and recalcitrant diabetic wounds.</p>

<div class="section" id="ch7lev2sec15"><h2 class="title">Contraindications</h2>
<p class="noindent">Various contraindications for this procedure include pregnancy, tumors, patients on anticoagulants, impaired sensation, peripheral vascular disorders, metal implant, acute rupture of ligaments and tendon, epiphyseal region, area of infection, and patients who are unable to communicate. Occasionally, tingling, aching, redness, or bruising are reported as side effects of this treatment, but these symptoms are of short duration.</p>
<div class="sidebar"><h2 class="title">Summary</h2>
<p class="">Ultrasound can produce thermal or nonthermal effects. Acoustic streaming increases the permeability of the cells. Ultrasonic therapy can be used for pain relief. Therapeutic ultrasound accelerates the healing and can be used in vast conditions. Various precautions to be taken while treating a patient with ultrasound are: Check the thermal sensation prior to the ultrasound application, use the suggested levels of ultrasound dosages, move the ultrasound head, avoid superficial bony prominences, avoid excess sensation of heat during the treatment, do not keep the ultrasound head in air when the output is on, maintain perfect contact in between the ultrasound head and the body tissues, etc. Pulsed ultrasound produces very minimal thermal effects, but it produces maximal mechanical or nonthermal effects. Extracorporeal shockwaves are the pressure waves that are generated outside the body and these waves can be used for the treatment of various musculoskeletal conditions like calcific deposits and tendonitis.</p>
