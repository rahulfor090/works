<p class="noindent">Day-to-day, we come across various physical forces, such as the warming rays of the sun, the light of the moon, the force of gravity, the movement of our body, our ability to move from one place to another, our ability to move an object from one place to another, the movement and flow of cold water, the movement and flow of hot water, electrical changes, magnetism, and so on. Almost all these phenomena around us form part of nature's inexhaustible and powerful array of forces. The same physical forces, if harnessed and properly directed, are of great value in promoting healing. They can relieve pain, increase circulation, speed up repair and healing of the injured body part, improve body mechanics and metabolism, inhibit the growth of germs, restore disturbed functions, cure the diseased body, restore homeostasis, improve health, and so on. This forms the basis of physical medicine. Though the evolution of “Physical Medicine or Physiotherapy” has happened gradually, physical agents in some form or the other, which are used for treatment purposes, are reasonably old—perhaps as old as matter itself.</p>
<p class="indent">Electrotherapy is an essential and foundational subject for undergraduate, graduate, and postgraduate physiotherapy students. There are many books available on this subject by the authors of the West. However, I personally feel that there are very few books by Indian authors who can understand everybody's needs, in a better way. Hence, there was need to bring out a book that would comprehensively cover electrotherapy in detail.</p>
<p class="indent">The purpose of this book is to provide a foundation of knowledge for the management of most types of patients using electrotherapeutic modalities. I have tried to write the chapters in such a way that it feels as if I am in front of you and explaining the topics directly. You may feel as if you are reading my lecture notes. I have also included my memory tricks to help you remember the content—you may use them if they work for you. Although, this book is primarily written for physiotherapy professionals, much of the information may also be useful for other clinicians actively involved in patient management.</p>
<p class="indent">I have received a lot of appreciation for this book, and, probably due to being its author, I received the highest award for a “Physiotherapist in India”—being named a Fellow of the Indian Association of Physiotherapists—and that too at such a young age!<a name="page8"></a><span class="pageBreak"></span><span class="pageNumbers"><span class="bottomPage">8</span></span></p>
<p class="indent">The book has been added as a textbook and a reference book for physiotherapy students at various Indian universities. I would like to express my gratitude to all admirers of this book and the publisher who has encouraged me to write a revised edition.</p>
<p class="indent">Medical and Physiotherapy knowledge is constantly changing. As new information becomes available, changes in treatment procedures, equipment, and the use of this equipment in clinical situations become necessary. I have as far as possible taken care to ensure that information given in this book is accurate and up-to-date. However, readers are strongly advised to confirm the information. A large number of suggested readings have been included at the end. This will help more interested readers to conveniently look for extra material on the subject of their interests.</p>
<p class="indent">In this third edition, I have taken immense care to include added content as per the recent developments and students’ feedback including clinical pearls, a chapter on pain, and basic concepts in electrotherapy and biomedical physics. Further, a conscious attempt has been made to add the information instead of changing or modifying it from previous two editions. My personal thoughts and comments are included and should be taken simply as guidelines. I would appreciate your comments about this book.</p>
