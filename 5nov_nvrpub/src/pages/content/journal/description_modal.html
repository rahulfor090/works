    <h5>Open Access Policy</h5>

    <p><b>A comprehensive outlook on open access policy that we follow:</b></p>

    <p>Open access refers to the practice of making peer-reviewed scholarly research and literature freely available
        online to anyone interested in reading it at no cost and with limited restrictions with regards to reuse.&nbsp;
        Open access publications are freely and permanently available online to anyone with an internet access. The
        journal allows unrestricted use, distribution and reproduction in any medium (which is non-commercial), provided
        the article is properly attributed. All the articles are published, without any technical, financial, gender
        limitations, in an agreed format on the journal website and deposited in archive and indexing databases as
        applicable to the journal. All articles are assigned a Digital Object Identifier (DOI), thereby making it fully
        citable and searchable by title, author name(s) and the full text.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

    <p><b>Why open access publishing?</b></p>

    <p id="8" paraeid="{a5c97953-b90e-4ba3-8d7c-066f73314269}{7}" paraid="1290995652">Restricted access to scientific
        research and advancements through subscription pay wall hinders communication within the scientific community.
        Moreover, restricted access can also hinder the education and dissemination of scientific knowledge to the
        aspiring younger generations who are keen to pursue a career in science. Increased productivity and development
        of science can only be achieved by diffusing knowledge and providing the facilities for creating permanent
        repositories such as Open Access.&nbsp;</p>

    <p paraeid="{a5c97953-b90e-4ba3-8d7c-066f73314269}{13}" paraid="578669430">The use of a Creative Commons 4.0 License
        (CC-BY-NC 4.0) enables user/reader/peer to use the content with clear permission in a way that it can be reused
        and redistributed as long as the article source is appropriately given credit for non-commercial purpose.&nbsp;
    </p>

    <h5><strong>Self-Archiving Policy for Authors</strong></h5>

    <p>The Donald School Journal of Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology upholds a Repository Policy and is listed in
        <a href="https://v2.sherpa.ac.uk/id/publication/45012?template=romeo"><strong>Sherpa Romeo</strong></a> for
        compliance with self-archiving regulations. Authors are encouraged to deposit the final published PDF in their
        institutional repository or any suitable subject repository (according to the end-user license of the article,
        i.e., strictly for non-commercial re-use) immediately upon publication. The deposited version should contain the
        URL and link to the online published version on the publisher’s website to clearly identify it as the definitive
        version of record.
    </p>

    <p><b>Abstract and Citation information</b></p>

    <p>Authors can share the Abstract and “How to cite” information (e.g., Title, Author name, Publication dates) of
        their article anywhere at any time including social media such as Facebook, blogs and Twitter, with proper
